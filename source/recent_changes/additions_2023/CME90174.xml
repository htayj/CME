<ARGUMENT>
<P>This MEC text began life as an OTA-distributed file (no. 174) apparently closely associated with the published edition by Gloria Cigman (Lollard Sermons, EETS OS 294, 1989), since its line breaks largely track with those of the print, though without italics, apparatus, folio references, page references, introduction, or notes. The OTA file also lacks one sermon entirely (no. 13), contains a corrupt version of another (sermon no. 4, with most lines lacking the first five or six letters), and misnumbers the concluding 'Sermon of Dead Men' as if it were sermon no.14. MEC has put the file in order, transcribed the missing bits, added paragraphing (inferred from spacing in the text file) and similar structural markup, as well folio references to the two primary MSS A and R (and to the third M when it forms the basis of the text). Since the line-based reference system depends on arbitrary line breaks, those have been preserved with P and LB tags. Text in square brackets has been left as such; text in angle brackets has been converted to the TEI tag 'supplied,' though 'unclear' may in some cases have been the more apt choice.</P></ARGUMENT>

<HEAD>1 FIRST SUNDAY IN ADVENT</HEAD>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1"/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="1r"/> Cum appropinquasset Jesus Jerosolimis, et cetera (Mt.21.[1]). Þys
<LB/>Sunday in whiche þys gospel is firste yrad in holi cherche is
<LB/>clepid þe Firste Sunday of Aduent. Aduent is as myche for to

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="5"/> þys Sunday into Cristenmasse Day makeþ special mynde of
<LB/>Crist, and þis gospel spekeþ of þe comynge of Crist, þerfore
<LB/>þis gospel pertynentli is rad þys day.</P>
<P>But heere men musten vnderstonde þat Hooli Scripture in
<LB/>diuerse placis spekeþ of foure maneres of comyngis of Crist.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="10"/> Þe firste comynge was whan <SUPPLIED>þ</SUPPLIED>e seconde persone of þe

<LB/>hire sides fourti wokes, and aftir was born, and þus bicam oure
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="15"/> broþer of oure kynde. Of þis comynge spekeþ Crist in Jones
<LB/>gospel, seynge þus (Jo.16.[28]): Exiui a Patre et veni in
<LB/>mundum. Þat is: 'I went out fro þe fadur and cam into þe
<LB/>world.'</P>
<P>Þe secunde comynge was whan <SUPPLIED>he</SUPPLIED> hadde lyued in þis

<P>And heere auȝten proude men of þis world, but principalli

<LB/>inclepe þe name of oure God. Þei beþ ibounde, and han yfalle;
<LB/>but we haue arise, and beþ arerud up.'</P>
<P>Of þis seconde comynge spekeþ þe lettre of þe gospel of þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="40"/> dai, and þe prophete Zacharie, seynge þus: Ecce rex tuus venit,
<LB/>et cetera. Þat is: 'Loo! Þi kyng comeþ to þe myldeli, sittynge on
<LB/>an asse,' et cetera.</P>
<P>Þe þridde comynge is goostli and is doun eueri day whanne
<LB/>God, of his endeles merci and grete grace, þorou inspiracion of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="45"/> þe Hooli Goost in bap<SUPPLIED>tem</SUPPLIED>, or in prechinge, or in gret sorwe
<LB/>of synnes, comeþ into synful mannes soules as into his owne
<LB/>temple. Of þis þridde comynge spekeþ Crist in Jones gospel in
<LB/>þis wise (Jo.14.[23]): Ad eum veniemus, et mansionem, et cetera.
<LB/>Þat is: 'My Fadir and I schal come to him þat loueþ me and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="50"/> kepeþ my word, and we schal make dwellyng wiþ him.' And
<LB/>God seyþ also in þe Apoc[alips](3.[20]): Ecce sto ad hostium et
<LB/>pulso, et cetera. Þat is: 'I stonde at þe dore' (þat is, of mannes
<LB/>soule) 'and knocke. Whoso heereþ my voice and openeþ to me
<LB/>þe ȝate, I schal entre to him, and soupe wiþ him, and he wiþ

<P>Þe fourþe comynge and þe laste schal be at general Dai of
<LB/>Jugemente, whan he schal come rialli in gret power and
<LB/>mageste to deme alle men 'wiþouten acceptynge of persones'
<LB/>after þei han deserued: þe goode to ioie, þe euele to peyne. Of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="60"/> þis fourþe comynge spekeþ þe prophete Ysaie, in þe þridde
<LB/>chapitre [14], seyinge þus: Deus ad iudicium veniet cum senibus
<LB/>populi sui, et cum principibus eius. Þat is: 'Þe Lord schal come to
<LB/>þe doom wiþ þe olde men of his peple, and wiþ his princis.' Þe
<LB/>tokenynge of þe comynge of þis Lord to þe Dom, as Seynt
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="65"/> Jerom seyþ vpon Mathew, schal be<SUPPLIED>o</SUPPLIED> 'whan his gospel schal <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="2r"/>

<P>Þe firste comynge and þe seconde of þis blessid Lord (þat is,
<LB/>firste into þis world, and after to his passion) beþ now passide,
<LB/>as þe lettre of þe firste gospel of Cristemasse Dai and þe lettre
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="70"/> of þe gospel of þis dai openli makeþ mencion, for whiche alle
<LB/>men beþ bonden wiþ herte, mouþ, and dede to ȝheue him grete
<LB/>þankyngis wiþoute any cesynge.</P>
<P>But for þe þridde comynge (þat is, þoroȝ grace into mannes
<LB/>soule) is euermore necessarie and nedeful to vs, seþþen wiþoute
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="75"/> him we moun noo þyng doo to profite of oure soule, of whiche
<LB/>spekeþ þis gospel if it be gostli vnderstonde, þerfore, wiþ þe
<LB/>help of almyti God, I purpose at þis tyme to speke of þis
<LB/>comynge.</P>
<P>Þis gospel bigynneþ þus: 'Whanne Jesus hadde neyhed ny to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="80"/> Jerusalem, and hadde come to Bethfage, at þe Mount of
<LB/>Olyuete, he sente two of his desciples, seyinge to hem: 'Gooþ
<LB/><SUPPLIED>i</SUPPLIED>nto þe castel þat is aȝens ȝou, and þere ȝhe schullen fynde an

<LB/>and ȝef any man sey any þing to ȝou, say ȝe þat þe Lord haþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="85"/> werke to þese, and anon he schal leue hem to ȝou".'</P>
<P>Jerusalem is as miche for to seye as 'þe syth of pees', bi
<LB/>whiche may wel be vndurstonde al holi cherche: þat is, þe
<LB/>g[e]neral congregacion of alle þat schullen be saued, for þey
<LB/> biholdeþ euur God in her soule, whiche is oure pees, as Seynt
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="90"/> Poule seiþ: Ipse est pax nostra. Of whiche 'biholdinge' spekeþ Dauid,
<LB/>seyinge: Prouidebam Dominum in conspectu meo semper. Þat is: 'I haue
<LB/>ordeined þe Lord euere in my siȝte.'</P>
<P>And þorou pees þat suche men maken bitwixe God and hem,
<LB/>and bitwixe hem and her breþeren, and bitwixe her bodi and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="95"/> her soule, þei beþ clepid of Crist 'þe sones of God' and þus
<LB/>euere in þis world beþ goynge toward euerelastynge pees. And
<LB/>ȝif it be soo þat ani tyme ani of hem, þorou frelte, necligence,
<LB/>oþur ignoraunce, falle into ani synne, as tyme as þey repente
<LB/>hem <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="2v"/> and axen of God wiþ deuoute preiere of merci and of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="100"/> grace, anon God neyheþ to suche a soule and forȝeueþ him his synnes.
<LB/>And þerfore seiþ þe Psalm Maker: Prope est Dominus
<LB/>inuocantibus eum in ueritate, et cetera. Þat is: 'Þe Lord is niȝ to alle
<LB/>men inclepinge him, inclepinge him in truþe.' And also bi
<LB/>Ezechiel þe prophete: In quacumque hora peccator ingemuerit,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> saluus erit, et cetera (Eze.18). Þat is: 'In whateuer hour þe synful
<LB/>[man] repenteþ him, he schal be saf.'</P>
<P>But for as myche as þis neiȝhinge of God þus þorouȝ grace
<LB/>comeþ ofte in þorouȝ þe word of God trueli prechid of þe mouþ
<LB/>of his prestis, and also þorou true confession maad of mannes
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> mouþ þorou deuout preier, þerfore it is wel seid þat Jesus cam
<LB/>bi Bethphage (þat is as myche for to sey as 'hous of mouþ')
<LB/>toward þis gostly Jerusalem (þat is, hooli cherche). Þat þis
<LB/>Bethphage was sette at þe Mount of Oliuete bitokeneþ þat
<LB/>deuoute and effectual preier muste be knitted to mercy, whiche
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="115"/> is bitokened bi þe Mount of Oliuete, as Crist haþ taut vs in
<LB/>oure Pater Noster, seyinge: Dimitte nobis, et cetera. Þat is:
<LB/>'Forȝeue to vs oure trespaces, as we don to oure trespasouris.'
<LB/>Also, confessioun of mouþ muste be ioyned to tristi hope of mercy,
<LB/>oþer ellis it is like to þe vnfruteful confessioun of Judas.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="120"/> Also, true prechinge of þe word of God must be ioined to þis
<LB/>Hil of Olyuete (þat is, oure Lord Jesus Crist), firste for to lyue
<LB/>holili, and after to preche trueli. Þat Jesus sente his disciplis
<LB/>bitokeneþ þat no man schulde take vpon him þe office of
<LB/>prechinge but if he hopede þat he be sente boþe of God and of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="125"/> man.</P>
<P>Whanne schal he suppose oþer hope þat he is þus sente?
<LB/>Whanne he is dueli ordeyned eþer orderid of a prelate, and
<LB/>after bisili studieþ in Goddis lawe, and þerwiþ lyueþ poreli,
<LB/>mekeli, and vertuousli, and is in ful wille to preche Goddis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="130"/> word oute to þe peple bisili, trueli, and freli, þanne may he verili
<LB/>suppose and hope þat he is sente boþe of God and of man
<LB/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="3r"/> to þis office. And herto nedeþ him non oþur lettre, but oneli
<LB/>þe lettres of his orderes and true practisynge in þis werke.</P>
<P>Þat Jesus sente two disciplis, raþer þan þre or foure, or ellis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> oon bi himself, bitokeneþ þat þoo þat schulde be prechoures of
<LB/>þe word of God schulden haue þese two þyngis: þat is, vertuous
<LB/>lyif and truþe of prechinge. Also, þat þey schulde be fulfillid of
<LB/>þe two membris of charite: þat is, of þe loue of God and after of
<LB/>loue of her breþeren. Also, þat alle true prechoures, as Crist
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> seiþ in Mat[hewes] gospel, schulden be 'like to þe housholdere
<LB/>þat bryngeþ forþ of his tresoure boþe oolde þyngis and

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> Þis castel þat he bad hem goo intoo, whiche he seiþ is euere aȝens
<LB/>hem, bitokeneþ þe falce wordeli men of whiche John
<LB/>spekeþ in his gospel, seyinge þus: Et mundus eum non cognouit
<LB/>(Jo.1.[10]). Þat is: 'And þe wor[l]d knew him noȝt.' Þis world
<LB/>mai wel be likenyd to a castel, for rith as a castel is a stronge

<LB/>Þat is: 'Þey gladen whan þei haue doon euele, and ioyen in

<P>Þis castel is euermore aȝens Criste and þe true prechoures of

<LB/>þat hadde be his; but, for ȝhe beþ noȝt of þe world, I
<LB/>haue chosen ȝou fro þe world, þerfore þe world hateþ ȝou.' And
<LB/>Seynt Johun seiþ in his pistil: Nolite mirari si odit uos mundus,
<LB/>et cetera ([1] Jo.3.[13-14]). Þat is: 'Merueileþ noȝt, breþeren,

<P>Þis femele asse þat is þus bounden is an old synful mannes fleisch,

<P>Also, an asse is leþi and feble tofore in his ferþer partis, and

<LB/>of alle his synnes and so maad free and Goddes childe. Also, if
<LB/>prechyng of Goddes word miȝte not vnbynde men of here
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="235"/> synne, þanne hadde þis word 'vnbyndeþ' in veyn be seid to þe

<LB/>maden many þousendes come to feiþ, and leue here erroures,

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="240"/> and alle suche were vnbounden of alle þe synnes þat þei haue
<LB/>doon.</P>
<P>But ȝet seiþ Crist forþermore: "Bryngeþ to me þat he
<LB/>vnbyndeþ,' for it sufficeþ noȝt to be vnbounden, but if þei be
<LB/>brout to Criste. And þerfore seiþe þe Psalme Maker: 'Bowe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="245"/> awei from euele, and doo good.' For, if a man schulde lede a
<LB/>beeste from oo place into anoþer, þe leder bihoueþ to go tofore and drawe
<LB/>þe best þe same wei after; so it sufficeþ noȝt ynow to

<P>After Crist seide to his desciplis þe wordes þat suen after in
<LB/>þis gospel: "and if ani man seie ani þyng to ȝou, seieþ þat þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="255"/> Lord haþ werk to þese' (oþer ellis, as Lu[ke] seiþ: 'Þe Lord
<LB/>desireþ þe werk of hem') and 'anon he <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="5r"/> schal leue hem to ȝou',
<LB/>þis Lord Jesus Crist, souereynst of alle oþere, vnderstood in

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="260"/> whiche traueloun faste in prechinge for to vnbynde synful

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="265"/> seyntis and hiȝe sitteþ wiþ God in blisse? It semeþ it is but a

<LB/>alle synnes þat þei diden, and specialli in necligence of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="275"/> prechynge, if þei diden so as men seyn, for þat was principal of
<LB/>here office, whiche Crist enioynede to alle prestis whan he
<LB/>schulde departe fro hem as þyng þat lai most on his herte,
<LB/>seyinge: Predicate euangelium omni creature (Mr.[16.15]). Þat
<LB/>is: 'Preche þe gospel to eueri creature.' And Seynt Gregorius
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="280"/> seiþ þus: Officium preconis suscipit quisquis ad sacerdotium
<LB/>accedit. Þat is: 'Þe office of crier he takeþ, hosoeuere to

<LB/>þus: Sacerdos ingrediens <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="5v"/> vel egrediens moritur, si de eo sonitus

<P>Also to þis obiect þat is maad of weyward men in þis matere

<LB/>And þerfore seiþ Seynt Poule: 'While dai is, wirche we,' þat is,

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> goode werkis in kynde, for þanne þei encrecen oure blisse in

<P>Þe þridde þat comeþ of þe wantyng of þe sunne and comyng

<LB/>For al þe while þat suche a man haþ þe conforte of þe sunne, it

<LB/>ignorance of Goddis lawe is come to any suche goostli sike
<LB/>man, þanne he is greteli disconfortid for defaute of goode
<LB/>ensamplis, and ful ofte engreggid to dispeir. But it semeþ to me
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> þat many men faren in goostli sikenessis as mani men doun in
<LB/>bodili sikenesses. A sike man in bodi þat liȝt in niȝt gretli

<LB/>and, as tyme as he hereþ hym, he is gretli confortid, for þanne
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> he hopeþ þe dai be nyh. So a gostli sike man in dedli synne þat
<LB/>desireþ gretli helþe of his soule, desireþ gretli after <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="11v"/> crowyng
<LB/>of þe cok (þat is, after true prechynge of þe word of God) and,

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> And wel þe prechour mai be likned to þe cok; for riȝt as þe

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="350"/> tofore Doom schal beo in þe mone. And þat schal beo whan þe
<LB/>moone, as Joel seid, 'schal turne into blood.' Bi þis moone mai
<LB/>be vnderstonde prelates, curatus, and alle þoo þat han taken þe
<LB/>order of presthode. For, riȝt as þe Book of Genesis telleþ
<LB/>(Ge.1.[16]) þat at þe makyng of þe world God ordeynede þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="355"/> more liȝt (þat is, þe sunne) to schyne to men bi dai, and a lasse
<LB/>nyȝt liȝt to schyne to men bi niȝte, so it is gostli. Þis 'more liȝt'
<LB/>is þe lomb, Jesus Crist, whiche, as þe Apoc[alips] seiþ, ȝyueþ
<LB/>sufficient liȝt inowȝ to alle seyntes þat been in þe blisse of
<LB/>heuene, whiche is euerlastyng daie, 'but þe cl<SUPPLIED>e</SUPPLIED>erte of God
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="360"/> liȝteneþ hem.' But here in þis world, whiche is as nyȝt in
<LB/>comparison <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="15v"/> <SUPPLIED>o</SUPPLIED>f þat blessid day, and also for temptacions of
<LB/>wikked spiritus þat wandren in þis world as in nyȝte, and for
<LB/>derknesse of ignoraunce and of synne whiche is among þe
<LB/>peple, þe 'lesse liȝt' (þat is, þe moone, whiche ben prestus)
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="365"/> schulden take þe liȝt of liȝf, and of þe techyng of Crist, as þe
<LB/>moone doþ of þe sunne, and schyne bi hire vertuus lyuynge
<LB/>and hire techynge to hem þat sitten in derknesse, and in
<LB/>schadeue of deþ (þat is, in dedli synne), to dresse hire feet (þat
<LB/>is, hire affeccions) into þe weie of pees (þat is, into kepynges of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="370"/> þe commaundementis of God), which leeden to euerlastyng
<LB/>pees. And for þis office Crist clepeþ hem "þe liȝt of þe world.'</P>
<P>But it schal þan fare bi þis goostli moone (þat is, prestis) as it
<LB/>fareþ bi þe moone þat is a visibile planete. In þe bigynnyng,
<LB/>whan þe moone is first changid, þe moone schyneþ a litel in þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="375"/> bigynnyng of þe nyȝt. And after, as þe moone wexeþ, hee
<LB/>schyneþ more and more til he be at þe fulle, and þan he
<LB/>schyneþ al þe nyȝt. But a litel tofore þat þe moone schal
<LB/>change aȝen, þe moone schineþ but a litel tofore þe dai. Riȝt so
<LB/>fareþ it bi þis goostli moone: for anon after þe ascencion of oure
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="380"/> Lord Jesus Crist, whanne þe sunne of riȝtwisnesse wiþdraweþ
<LB/>bodili out of þis world and goon to reste, þanne was þe moone
<LB/>first changid, for þere newe presthode after Cristus order was
<LB/>browȝt in.</P>
<P>Of þis changyng spekeþ Seynt Poule, þere he seiþ: Translato
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="385"/> sacerdotio. Þat is: 'Whan presthode was translatid or <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="16r"/> chaungid.'
<LB/>Þanne, in þe bigynnynge of þis niȝt, þis presthode
<LB/>schynede in fewe persones: þat was in þe xij apostelis, and a
<LB/>fewe disciplis. But afterward, þis presthode encrecid in gret
<LB/>noumbre. And þanne þe liȝt of her werkes, and of here
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="390"/> techynge and wilful suffryng, þerfore gret martirdoom, schynede
<LB/>longe tyme þoo into al þis world and so brouȝten manie
<LB/>men out of derknesses of her synnes into þe liȝt of grace and
<LB/>gode vertues, in so myche þat many wynter duryng togidere
<LB/>þer was greet plente of popes, bischopis, and prestis martired
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="395"/> for here holi liȝf and here true prechynge.</P>
<P>But, as I seide, whan þe moone schal chaunge aȝen, it
<LB/>schyneþ but a litel tofore þe dai. So tofore þe eende of þe
<LB/>world, after whiche presthode schal be changed aȝen for it
<LB/>schal be chaunged more briȝtere and perfitere foorme, þanne þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="400"/> presthode schal schyne but in a fewe chosen persones tofore þe
<LB/>dai come -- þat is, þe Dai of Doom, whiche schal bigynne þenne
<LB/>and be euerlastyng in ioie to hem þat schullen be saued. And þe
<LB/>cause whi þat it schal schyne þan so litel, þat is, in so fewe
<LB/>persones, is þis: for þe moore part þanne of þe moone schal be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="405"/> turned into blood. Þat is: þe more part of þe presthode þanne
<LB/>schal be turned into synful liȝf, whiche is vnderstonde bi
<LB/>'blood' in mani placis of Hooli Scripture. And to hem it schal
<LB/>be pertinentli seid þe wordes þat God seiþ bi his <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="16v"/> prophete
<LB/>([Ysa.1.15]): Cum multiplicaueritis orationes vestras, non
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="410"/> exaudiam uos, quia manus uestre sanguine plene sunt. Þat is:
<LB/>'When ȝhe schullen multiplie <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="17r"/> ȝoure preieres (as þey schulle

<LB/>is, ȝoure werkes beþ ful of synne.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="415"/> Principally þanne þe presthode schal be turned into þre
<LB/>synnes: þat is, into pride, couetise, and symonie.</P>
<P>Pride þanne schal be ful hiȝ in prelatis, for hir pride schal
<LB/>passe alle temperalle lordes in alle þyngis þat longe[þ] to lordes

<P>Þe secunde synne (þat is, couetise) schal be ful plenteus in
<LB/>prestes in þo dayes, for þanne schal þe prophecie of Jeremie be
<LB/>fulfillid (Jere.[6.13]): A minore ad maiorem omnes student auaricie,

<P>Whiche is þe þredde foul synne (þat is, symonie) þat schal be

<LB/>þat God hateþ, and princepalli in þe prestis. And þat semeþ

<P>And wanne prestes schul be cumbrid wiþ þese þre foule

<LB/>þis gostli moone foule be turned into blod, whiche is a gret
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="460"/> signe þat þe Day of Doom is niȝh. Hereto acordeþ þe doctour
<LB/>Crisostom in his Omelie þere he seyþ: 'Wanne derkenesse is in

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="470"/> Þe þredde sygne þat Crist telle[þ] in his gospel þat schal

<LB/>Jones disciples and manye oþere weren in þis erroure: þat þei

<P>And first he affermeþ þe stablenesse of John, syþþe bi non of

<P>But Crist seide he was a prop[h]ete, for he hadde a cleer

<LB/>And he was more þan a prophet, for he hadde more þan þis

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="370"/> Also, Crist seiþ þat þe Fadire preisede Jon to him bi

<LB/>And þerfore <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="31v"/> seiþ Dauid: Omnes declinauerunt, simul inutiles

<LB/>ȝou.' And anon, Abraham, at þe biddinge of God, he circumcidide
<LB/>hymself, and Ismael [h]is sone, and alle þe males of his

<LB/>of circumsicioun first took his bigynnynge of þe blesside
<LB/>patriark, Abra[ham]. <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="51v"/></P>
<P>þe secounde þyng þat vs bihoueþ to knowe in þis matere is
<LB/>þis: wherto circumsicioun was ordeyned, and whereof it
<LB/>seruede. Herto may be answered þus: þat circumcision was
<LB/>ordeyned þat bi þe obedience of þe comaundement of circumcisioun
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="40"/> Abraham schulde plese to God, to woom Adam
<LB/>displeside bi brekynge of his comaundement.</P>
<P>It was ordeyned also in tokene of þe fey of Abraham þat, in
<LB/>þe olde age of him and of his wyif boþe, bileeuede to haue a
<LB/>sone in whom schulde be maad þe blessynge of alle men.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="45"/> Anoþer cause of þis ordinaunce was þis: for as miche as
<LB/>Abraham was þe first to whom expressly was maad biheeste of
<LB/>þe incarnacioun of Crist, þerfor it was reson[a]ble þat þe
<LB/>feyful peple þat schulde come of him (of whom Crist schulde
<LB/>be born, to whom þe lawe schulde be ȝouen after) weren
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="50"/> knowen bi a certeyn signe fro vnfeyful peple; and so, bi þe
<LB/>same signe, whane any of hem were ded in batayle, miȝte be
<LB/>knowe and so taken and biried wiþ her breþeren.</P>
<P>And circumcisioun was comaundid to be maad in þat part of
<LB/>þe bodi oneli for þis cause: for it was ordeyned in remedie aȝen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="55"/> original synne þat we token of oure formere faderis bi luste,
<LB/>whiche haþ most lordschipe in þat parte. For in þat partie þe
<LB/>firste man <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="52r"/> felide synne of vnobedience, þerfore it was
<LB/>cordynge þat þere he schulde take þe sygne of obedience.</P>
<P>Whereof þis circumcisioun seruede, þe Maister of þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="60"/> Sentence telleþ openly in his fourþe book, and alleggeþ for him
<LB/>boþe Augus[tine] and Bede, þat circumsicioun seþþe þe tyme
<LB/>þat it was ordeyned in þe peple of God it seruede boþe to olde
<LB/>and ȝenge of þe same seruice þat now dooþ baptem seþþe it was
<LB/>ordeyned (þat is, to do awey origynal synne) except þat it miȝte
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="65"/> not opene þe ȝates of heuene to hem þat token oneli circumcisioun,
<LB/>whiche now dooþ baptem. Naþeles, þei þat weren
<LB/>circumcidid aftur her deþ weren confortid þorouȝ a blesside
<LB/>reste in þe bosum of Abraham, and biden þe entree of
<LB/>heue[n]ly pees in blesside hope.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="70"/> Þe þrydde þyng þat vs nedeþ to knowe in þe mater of
<LB/>circumcisioun is þis: whi þat Crist was circumcidid. Heereto
<LB/>men moun answere þat for seuene resonable causis Crist was
<LB/>circumcidid.</P>
<P>Þe firste cause: for to schewe in him þe truþe of flesche aȝen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="75"/> þe erroure of Manicheijs, þat seiden þat he hadde a fantastik
<LB/>bodi; and also aȝen Valentyne, heretik, þat seide þat he hadde
<LB/>an heuenli bodi.</P>
<P>Þe secounde cause was for to approue circumcisioun, whiche
<LB/>God ordeyned tofore.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="80"/> Þe þridde cause was for to schewe þat he was of þe kynde of
<LB/>Abraham, þat was þe firste prince of circumcisioun, takynge þe
<LB/>biheeste of Crist.</P>
<P>Þe fourþe cause was þat he were not put abak out of þe
<LB/>cumpenie of Jewes for his prepucie, þat is þe custum of hem
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="85"/> þat ben not <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="52v"/> circumcidid.</P>
<P>Þe fiyfþe cause was for to comende to vs obedience, wile he
<LB/>þat was not suget fulfillide þe lawe.</P>
<P>Þe sixte cause was þat, as he cam in liknesse of flesche of
<LB/>synne, so he schulde take remedie for synne.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="90"/> Þe seuenþe cause was þat he þat bar þe birþen of þe lawe in
<LB/>himself schulde deliuere oþere men fro þe charge of þe lawe.</P>
<P>And þus, for þese seuen causes rehersid bifore, Crist Jesus,
<LB/>þis ȝenge child, was circumcidid in his tender flesche, for it was
<LB/>doon in þe eyteþe day suynge aftur þat he was born of his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="95"/> moder into þis world.</P>
<P>Miche ben we holden to þis blesside Lord þat was and is so
<LB/>gret, as John seiþ in þe Apoc[alips], þat he is 'Kyng of Kynges,
<LB/>and Lord of Lordes'; and as Dauid seiþ in þe Psauter: Magnus
<LB/>Dominus et laudabilis, et cetera. Þat is: 'He is a gret Lord' þat of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="100"/> his gretnesse is non ende, and ȝet he wolde fouchesaf to brynge
<LB/>himself so lowe in staat of a litel child to 'take þe forme of a
<LB/>seruaunt', as Poule seiþ to Philip.[2.7]. Of þis blesside child
<LB/>spekeþ Ysaie þe prophet, seyinge: Puer natus est nobis, et filius
<LB/>datus est nobis, et cetera. þat is: 'A child is born to vs, and a sone
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> is ȝouen to vs.'</P>
<P>And þus, in þis eyteþe day, þat was þe day of circumcisioun
<LB/>as þis gospel seiþ, þe name of þe child was clepid 'Jesus',
<LB/>whiche was clepid of þe aungel tofore he was conceyued in his
<LB/>moderis woombe. But heere men musten vn[der]stonden þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> þis name 'Jesus' <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="53r"/> þat þilke dai was putt to þis blesside childe
<LB/>was not first clepid and assigned of þe angel, as it semeþ þat þe
<LB/>gospel meneþ, but it was nempned of þe Holi Trinite wiþoute
<LB/>ani bigynnnge, as þe prophete Ysa[ie] seide: Vocabitur tibi
<LB/>nomen nouum, quod os Domini nominauit. Þat is: 'To þe schal be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="115"/> clepid a newe name, þat þe mouþ of God haþ nempned.' But þe
<LB/>clepynge of þis angel and of his parentis boþe was not ellis but
<LB/>a pronuncynge, declarynge, eþer openynge þe clepynge of God
<LB/>tofore. Riȝt so, þe asoylyng eþer byndyng of prestis heere in
<LB/>Cristis cherche is noȝt ellis but a schewyng bi certeyn euidencis
<LB/>þat suchon is eþer bounden eþer assoiled of God tofore.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="120"/> After þis litel declarynge of þis schorte gospel of þis dai, me
<LB/>þynkeþ it were necessarie for to k[nowe] whi þat cristen men

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="125"/> for it is þe firste dai of þe newe ȝer, neþer for it was riȝt eþer
<LB/>custom of þe Olde Lawe is cause whi þat cristen men halewen
<LB/>þis dai. Þe firste cause were ouer lewid; þe seconde is also now
<LB/>no cause. For, as Seint Poule proueþ in his pistole to þe
<LB/>Galatheis, after Cristus deþ and general publicacion of þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="130"/> Newe Lawe, þe riȝtes of þe Olde Lawe weren dede, and
<LB/>specialli circumcision voide bi þe comynge in [of] baptem, for
<LB/>baptem ȝeueþ al þat circumcision ȝaf and miche more, for it
<LB/>ȝeueþ more plenteuosli grace and entree anon into þe blisse of

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> But ȝhe sc[h]ulde vnderstonde þat for twei causes more <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="53v"/>
<LB/>resonable þis dai is halewid amonge criste[n] men:</P>
<P>Oon is for þis dai is þe vtaues of þe birþe of oure Lord Jesus
<LB/>Crist, and ȝef men make solempne þe vtaues of oþer seyntis

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> holi his vtaues þat haleweþ or makeþ holi al oþer halewes.</P>
<P>Anoþer cause is þis: for þis dai oure blesside Lord Jesus
<LB/>schedde oute þe firste blood of his tendir bodi to paie ernest of
<LB/>þe raunsum for mankynde, whiche he paied after fulli on þe
<LB/>Goode Fridai in his passion. And þis is a blessid cause þis dai

<P>Þe firste is þat it be for gostli þyng, whiche is worschipe to

<LB/>to God for þyng whiche was not worschipe to God ne pro[f]ite
<LB/>to his soule, it was not graun[t]id him of God, alþou þat he
<LB/>hadde tofore grantid to his disciplis: 'whateuer þyng ȝe schullen <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="59v"/>

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> þyng þat is not gostli ne profite to mannes soule is not axede in
<LB/>Jesus name, whiche bitokeneþ "saueour'. But Salamon, whan
<LB/>God put in his chois þre þyngis, summe bodili and summe
<LB/>goostli, for as miche as he chees wisdom and discrecion to rule
<LB/>his peple, was gostli þing to worschipe of God, helþe of his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> soule, and prophite of his breþeren, þerfore God granted him
<LB/>alle. So, axe þou first gostli þyng, and God wole grante to þe al
<LB/>bodili þyng þat is nedeful to þe: Primum querite regnum Dei, et
<LB/>cetera.</P>
<P>Þe secounde condicion is þat it be do lastyngli, as Seint Jame
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> seiþ: Multum valet, et cetera. Noȝt ȝef þou bigynne to preie
<LB/>and, so beo not granted to þe, þat þou cese of þi preier, but þat

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> as he seiþ, 'er we axe, he wot what vs nedeþ' -- and what he
<LB/>wole grante. But he desireþ to see þe encrecynge of oure good
<LB/>wille, whiche was wel schewid bi þe womman of Chanan þat

<P>Þe þridde condicion is þis: þat preier be maad in charite, for
<LB/>wiþouten þat is no þyng worþ þat we don here in erþe, as Seint

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="170"/> Þe þridde offrynge þat we schulden offre to þis blesside

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="325"/> And þis firste blyndenesse (of mysbileue) is cause of þe

<LB/>Þat is: 'Þei schullen wandre as blynde men, for þei haue <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="86r"/>

<P>And þus in þis maner, answerynge þoru þe helpe of God,

<P>Þe þridde temptacion þat þe fend temptide oure Lord Jesus
<LB/>Crist was to þe synne of couetise vpon þe hiȝe hil, as I seide

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="220"/> falle into þe same synne.</P>
<P>First, þe processe of þe gospel telleþ þat he ladde Crist into a
<LB/>ful hiȝ hil and schewide him alle þe kyngdoms of þe world, and
<LB/>al þe glorie of hem, and seid <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="94r"/> to him: 'Alle þese þyngis I schal

<LB/>processe he haþ ȝet al dai to men þat he seþ disposid to
<LB/>couetise, and desireþ to be hiȝe and gret in þis world. First, þe
<LB/>fend ledeþ him vpon þe hil. After, þe glorious þyngis of þe
<LB/>world ben schewid to him. Þe þridde tyme, þer is putte to him
<LB/>a condicion: þat is, if he worschipe þe deuel alle þingis schul be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="230"/> maad hise.</P>
<P>Þis is þus myche to mene: whan a man desireþ to be maad
<LB/>grete and hiȝ in the world, þanne he stieþ into þe hil att þe
<LB/>deuelis ledynge. And whanne he bigynneþ nyȝt and dai to
<LB/>þenke into richessis and worschipis, and putteþ alle suche
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="235"/> þyngis tofore þe iȝen of his mynde, þanne þe prince of þis

<LB/>whan h<SUPPLIED>e</SUPPLIED> feleþ þat þi þouȝtis ben longe tyme sette afire in þe

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="240"/> fend, leuynge þe feiþ of God, and serue to him, forsakynge þe
<LB/>riȝtwisnesse of God, and do þefte, and raueyne, and deceite,
<LB/>and suche oþer. If þou chese to worschipe God in his feiþ, and
<LB/>serue him after his commaundementis, þou schalt not gete al þo
<LB/>þyngis.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="245"/> Þerfore þe apostle techeþ: 'I biseche ȝou, breþeren, to haue

<LB/>and losse. But forsoþe, of alle euelis þe bigynnynge is couetise.'
<LB/>Þerfore alle þoo þyngis þat þe deuele [leyde to] Crist, he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="255"/> despisede hem bicause þat he schulde not ȝeue þe glorie of God
<LB/>to þe deuele. And to teche man þouȝ al þe world schulde be

<LB/>for to despise þe creatour for þe creature, but þe creature for þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="260"/> creatour; for God mai ȝeue þe richesses, but richesses moun
<LB/>not ȝeue þe God.</P>
<P>And þerfore, be wel war of þese þre sotil nettis of þe fende:
<LB/>þat is, glotenye, veynglorie, and couetise. For Crisostom seiþ
<LB/>þat þe deuele, whan he temptide Crist, seide 'þese þre nettis I
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="265"/> haue streiȝte oute ouer al þe world: þat whatsoeuere scape oute

<LB/>whatsoeuere schape oute of þe nettis of veynglorie, renne into
<LB/>þe nettis of auarice. For þese þre no man perfiteli ascapeþ. And
<LB/>if any man ascapeþ, he ascapeþ not hool, but broken.' And
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="270"/> þerfore, þouȝ a man ascape þe nett of glotenye and ȝeue him to

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="275"/> seiþ: A maiore usque ad minimum, et cetera. 'Fro þe meste to þe

<LB/>And Salamon seiþ: 'Alle þyngis obeien to moneie.'</P>
<P>Þerfore, if þou wolt wiseli ouercome þe fend in þis temptacion
<LB/>and ascape his nette of couetise, answere to him as
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="280"/> Crist answeride in þe same caas, for he is þe beste maister, and
<LB/>whoso doþ after him he mai not faile, for he seiþ: 'I haue ȝeue

<P>Þou schalt vndirstonde, as þe doctour Crisostom seiþ vpon

<LB/>so<SUPPLIED>u</SUPPLIED>le, and his temperal goodes, and his neiȝbour boþe.</P>
<P>First, it is forboden of God (Luc.[21.34]) where he seiþ þus:
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="10"/> 'Takeþ hede to ȝou[re]self, lest perauenture ȝoure hertes be
<LB/>greued wiþ glotenye, and drunkschipe, and bisinesse of þis

<P>Also, it is a maner of despite don to God; for he leueþ him
<LB/>and cheseþ him a newe god, for suchon makeþ his beli his god,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="15"/> as Seint Poule seiþ (Phil.3.[19]): Quorum deus venter est, et
<LB/>cetera. And so he brekeþ þe firste commaundement, makynge
<LB/>him a fals god.</P>
<P>Also, it makiþ a man grucche aȝens God; for, as Goddes lawe
<LB/>seiþ: 'Mi loue was maad fatt, and he kikede.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="20"/> Also, glotenye harmeþ mannes soule; for a gloton pleseþ þe
<LB/>deuele, for þe gospel seiþ þat a legyon of fendis preieden Crist
<LB/>þat þei scholden goo into swyn, bi whom ben vndirstonde
<LB/>glotenos men.</P>
<P>Also, þei ben cursid of God; for þe prophete Ysa[y] seiþ (5
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="25"/> chapitre [11]): 'Cursid be ȝe þat ariseþ erli for to suen
<LB/>drunkschipe, and for to drynken til to euentide.'</P>
<P>Also, glotenye harmeþ mannes bodi; for hit bryngeþ in
<LB/>sikenesse and is ofte cause of destruccion, boþe of bodi and of
<LB/>soule. Þerfore seiþ þe Wise Man (Ecci.37.[33-34]): 'In many
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="30"/> metis wanteþ not sikenesse, and for glotenye many men han
<LB/>perischid', and 'he þat is abstinent schal eche his liyf.' And
<LB/>Seint Poule seiþ: 'Þe mete to þe wombe, and þe wombe to þe

<P>Also, glotenye deformeþ in man þe ymage of þe Trynite; for
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="35"/> bi þis ymage he excelleþ oþer passeþ alle oþer beestis -- þat is: in
<LB/>resoun, mynde, and good wille. Þanne his resoun is aweie, for
<LB/>he discernyþ not bitwixe good and euele, for þat þat is euele, he
<LB/>weneþ be good; and <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="97r"/> þat þat is good, he weneþ be euele. And
<LB/>þus, whanne he is in þis plite, what is he but mad? þerfore
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="40"/> Senec[a] seiþ: 'What is drunkenesse but wilful wodnesse?' And
<LB/>þe doctour Lync[oln] seiþ: 'Drunkeschipe is wodnesse, for

<P>Þenne is he also redi to wraþþe; for if any man displese him,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="50"/> ȝe! þouȝ it were for his goode, þanne anon he is wroþ, and

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="60"/> and falseli swere þerto.</P>
<P>Þanne also he is redi to coue<SUPPLIED>i</SUPPLIED>te oþer mennes godes bi þefte

<P>And þus, as I haue schewid, a gloton, whanne he wanteþ
<LB/>resoun, is redi to alle manere of synnes. And ȝif men take hede
<LB/>of alle maner of synnes, drunkenesse is [þe] most perelous

<P>I seide also bifore þat a drunken man leseþ also þe seconde

<P>To þe pore, for al þe superflu of mennys resonable sustynaunce

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> in as myche as þe glotoun eteþ and drynkeþ ouer mesure, in so
<LB/>myche he wiþdraweþ of pore mennes liyflode and so he is cause

<LB/>hem, brenneþ vp al hire godis.</P>
<P>And þus, as I haue schewid, many harmes comeþ of þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="115"/> synne of glotenye, boþe bodili and goostli. And þerfore seiþ þe
<LB/>Wise Man: 'Many men for glotenye han perisched.'</P>

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="130"/> woo? to whos fadir woo? to whom striues? to whom diches? to
<LB/>whom puttenynge oute of yen? but to hem þat duellen in wyn
<LB/>and studien in swyngynge vp of bolles.'</P>
<P>Also, glotenye mai be lickned to þe deueles bridel; for riȝt as a
<LB/>rider, after [þat] he haþ bridelid his hors, ledeþ him whider so
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> he wole, so [þe] deuele, after þat he haþ bridelid a man wiþ þe
<LB/>bridel of glotenye, ledeþ a man into what vice so him likeþ, as I
<LB/>seide and rehercid bifore. Þerfore seiþ Dauid, in þe Psauter: In
<LB/>chamo et freno, et cetera. Þat is: 'In halter and bridel constreyne
<LB/>her cheke bones.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> Þe seconde synne of þese þre synnes þat I spake of is
<LB/>veynglorie, whiche is a foule wille to be preisid of any good þat
<LB/>man haþ of God, of whiche he scholde preise God oneli and
<LB/>ȝeue þe worschipe <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="99r"/> to him, for þat falleþ to God as his part,
<LB/>and to vs þe profite. Veyneglorie is a synne þat doþ myche
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> harme, for it robbeþ boþe God and man.</P>
<P>First it robbeþ God of þat þat is aproprid to him, þat is:
<LB/>worschipe and glorie, whiche a veyngloryous man desireþ to
<LB/>himself in as myche as in him is. Þerfore seiþ Seint Poule: 'To
<LB/>þe kyng of worldis, vndedli, ynuysible, oneli to God, honure
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> and glorie.'</P>
<P>It robbeþ also man of his goostli godis wiþ wiche he myȝte
<LB/>bie him heuene, for it fordoþ hem, be þer neuer so manie, and
<LB/>makeþ hem turne to noȝt; and þat þat good schulde be, makeþ
<LB/>turne to euele. And as it is impossible to haue þe gras and þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="155"/> seed to springe boþe at ones, so it is impossible to desire here
<LB/>wordeli preisynge for ouȝt þat men doon in þis liyf, and also
<LB/>after þis life to haue þerfore mede in heuene. For Crist biddeþ
<LB/>to alle suche: triste to non oþer mede but suche as þei axen
<LB/>here, for wiþ wronge þei axen mede of God for þat þyng þat is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="160"/> not don for his loue.</P>
<P>Also, veyneglorie not oneli robbeþ man of his goodes, but
<LB/>also turneþ him to gret harme in oþer sidis. For of hool it
<LB/>makeþ him sike, and of life it bryngeþ in deeþ. And medicyn
<LB/>sore woundeþ him. Good he turneþ to euele, and vertu to vice.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="165"/> What wisdom is hit for to ȝeue mennes gode dedis for
<LB/>fleynge wordes þat passen as þe wynd, and forsake mede þat
<LB/>euer schal laste? Bet<SUPPLIED>e</SUPPLIED>re were no good to doo, þan to do hit in
<LB/>ful wille to be preisid. Caste in <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="99v"/> þyn herte what [he] þynkeþ bi
<LB/>[þe] of whom þou þenkest to be preised for þi goode dede.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="170"/> Þerfore he loueþ þe: for he troweþ þat þou dost hit for þe loue
<LB/>of God oneli. If he wiste þat þou it didest oonli for him, noȝt
<LB/>ellis wolde he doo but scorne þe for þi dede. Þerfore, wiþ emty
<LB/>hondes þei gooþ to God þat coueiten mede in þis world of hire
<LB/>goode dedis.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="175"/> Veynglorie is þe peny þat þe fend haþ euer redi to eche
<LB/>mannes harme in þe feire of þis world, to bie wiþ al hire dedis.</P>
<P>Veynglorie is þe grete wynd þat ouercasti[þ] grete toures,
<LB/>steples, and trees þat weren depe rotefast in þe ground as it
<LB/>semede, þat is: hiȝe men and hooli in life to mennes semynge
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="180"/> þis curside synne casteþ into helle. He þat loueþ veynglorie
<LB/>makeþ losengeris and liers his domesmen, and setteþ þe
<LB/>preisynge of hem bifore þe preisynge of God. And þis mai not
<LB/>be wiþoute grett despite of God, and þus it semeþ a foule
<LB/>blasfemye, for it draweþ fro God þat þat longeþ to him.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="185"/> A ueynglorious man mai wel be lickned to an hen þat, as
<LB/>tyme as sche haþ leide an eie, sche makeþ grete noise; so suche
<LB/>a man, anon as he haþ do any good d<SUPPLIED>e</SUPPLIED>de, he willeþ to be
<LB/>preisid and grete noise to be maad of him.</P>
<P>And not oonli þis synne of veynglorie is to be hatid, whiche
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="190"/> is a spice of pride, but also al maner of pride. For pride was þe
<LB/>firste synne and bigynnynge of al euele, as þe Wise Man seiþ
<LB/>(Ecci.10.[15]): Initium omnis peccati superbia. Þat is:
<LB/>'Bigynnynge <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="100r"/> of al euele was pride. He þat holdeþ hit schal be
<LB/>fulfillid wiþ cursis, and it schal ouercome him in þe ende.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="195"/> Pride made þe faire aungel, Lucifer, to be apostata and firste
<LB/>breke þe swete ordre and feloschipe of angelis whanne he, for
<LB/>his fairhede and his myche witt, wolde haue be aboue alle oþer
<LB/>angelis and made him pere to God þat, of his godenesse, made
<LB/>him so faire and so wise. Þerfore he hadde a foule falle fro þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="200"/> heiþe of heuen into þe deppest pit of helle and bicam a lodli
<LB/>fend, and alle þat to [him] assentide.</P>
<P>But, alas for sorwe! hou many men nowadaies ben apostatas,
<LB/>brekynge þoru hire foule and horrible pride þe feire feloschipe
<LB/>of holi cherche? Þe more harme is, men mai seie wiþ grete
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="205"/> mornynge and sorwe þe wordes of Dauid þe prophete, where
<LB/>he seiþ: 'Þe pride of hem þat hatide þe stieþ alweie vp hiere and
<LB/>hiere.' So hie it is stied nouȝ þat non astaat of holi cherche (þat
<LB/>is, neþer presthode, ne knyȝthode, ne comyn peple) holdeþ
<LB/>hem apaied wiþ hire estaat, but bisieþ hem euer wiþ al hire

<LB/>and hiere. And þey þat next scholden sue Crist in mekenesse
<LB/>and alle maneres of vertues, to whom principali he seiþ:
<LB/>'Lerneþ of me, for I am mylde and meke of herte', beþ nouȝ
<LB/>mooste hie and most proude, passynge hire estaat of alle maner
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="215"/> of peple. For, þeras Crist mekeli comynede wiþ his disciplis,
<LB/>and serued hem and louli wische her feet, and callid hem his

<LB/>þynge þat ofte litil auaileþ to any helpe of soule, as þouȝ þei
<LB/>hadde non oþer kyng but oneli hem alone.</P>
<P>Þere also, Crist hadde neuer hous of his owne bi title of

<P>Þis mai wel be þe abhomynacion of discunforte þat Daniel
<LB/>spekiþ of, stondynge in holi place (þat is, here in Cristis

<LB/>'Þe enemyes forsoþe of þe Lord anon as þei beþ honoured and enhaunced,

<LB/>Crist seiþ in þe gospel: Compelle eos intrare.</P>
<P>Also, þei þat ben in þe estaat of knyȝthode, þoru þis foule

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="260"/> aparaile þat longeþ vnto hem, aboue hire auncetres þat weren

<P>First, in proude araie of houshold. Þere as hir auncetres

<LB/>musten be serued wiþ selueren vessel, and þe leste page in his

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="270"/> Hire cloþynge also axeþ so hie cost, boþe in cloþ, peerlis, and

<P>Þere also as sum tyme a worþi bacheler of gret estaat hilde

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="275"/> wiþ 8 or 10 ȝemen, alle of sute of as gret araie as sum tyme
<LB/>weren ful worþi squyers.</P>
<P>But what wole falle of þis pride, I am sikir, as it is seid in
<LB/>comen prouerbe: 'Pride goþ bifore, and schame comeþ after.'
<LB/>Þat is: oþer þei mut be stronge þefes, to robbe here neiboris in

<P>Nouȝ also þe comyn peple is hie stied into þe synne of pride,
<LB/>for now a wrecchid cnaue þat goþ to þe plouȝ and to [þe] carte,
<LB/>þat haþ no more good but serueþ fro ȝer to ȝer for his liflode,
<LB/>þereas sum tyme a white curtel and a russet gowne wolde haue
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="290"/> serued suchon ful wel, now he muste haue a fresch doublet of

<LB/>musten haue xx oor þritti, and his lyuerei also þerto, not for he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="300"/> wol do more werk, but for to meynten wiþ þat pride.</P>
<P>Þus pride stieþ in alle astatis, as ȝe haue herd rehercid bifore,
<LB/>þat ful greuousli greueþ God and harme[þ] boþe bodi and
<LB/>soule. Þis synne of pride doþ many harmes, as Holi Writt
<LB/>witnessiþ in many placis:
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="305"/> First, it vsurpeþ to himself þat þat longeþ oneli to God, aȝens
<LB/>þat þat God seiþ bi Ysaie: Gloriam meam alteri non dabo. Þat is:
<LB/>'I schal not ȝeue my glorie to anoþer man.'</P>
<P>Also, pride is cause ofte of þe los of many men, boþe bodi
<LB/>and soule, as it was of Pharao and of al his hoost (Ex.14.[28]),
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="310"/> and also of Chore and of his feloschipe ([Nm.16.32]).</P>
<P>Also, it deformeþ þe feiþ and þe resonable ymage of men, as
<LB/>it dide of Nabugodonosor, of whiche also spekeþ Dauid in þe
<LB/>Psauter, þere he seiþ þus: Homo, cum in honore esset, et cetera.
<LB/>Þat is: 'Man, whan he was in worschipe, vndirstod not. He is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="315"/> comparisond to vnwise beestis, and maad like to hem.'</P>
<P>Also, pride deposeþ a man fro þe worschipeful estat and
<LB/>frendschipe þat he haþ wiþ God, as Oure Ladi seiþ in hire
<LB/>songe (Luc.1.[52]): Deposuit potentes de sede. Þat is: 'He haþ
<LB/>deposid myȝti men fro þe sete.' And Jere[mie] (50.[32]) seiþ:
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="320"/> Superbus corruet, et non erit qui suscitet eum. Þat is: 'Þe proude
<LB/>man schal falle, and no man schal arere him.' Also, God seiþ, bi
<LB/>Abdie þe profete (1 chapitre [4]): Si exaltatus fueris ut aquila, et
<LB/>inter sidera posueris nidum tuum, inde detraham te, dicit
<LB/>Dominus. Þat is: 'If þou be enhauncid <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="102v"/> as þe egle, and putte þi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="325"/> nest amonge þe sterris, I schal drawe [þe] fro þennes, seiþ þe
<LB/>Lord.' And God also seiþ ([1] Mac.2.[62]): A verbis viri
<LB/>peccatoris ne timueritis, quia gloria eius stercus et vermis est; hodie
<LB/>extollitur, et cras non invenietur; quia conuersus est in terram
<LB/>suam, et cogitatio eius periet. Þat is: 'Ne drede ȝou noȝt of þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="330"/> wordis of þe synful man, for his glorie is tort and wormes; todai
<LB/>he is enhauncid, and tomorwe he is not founde, for he is turned
<LB/>into his erþe, and his þouȝt schal perische.' And Job [20.6-7]
<LB/>seiþ bi þe proud man: Si ascenderit usque in celum superbia eius,
<LB/>et caput eius nubes tetigerit, quasi sterquilinium in fine perdetur.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="335"/> Þat is: 'If his pride stieþ vp into heuene, and his heued touche
<LB/>þe cloudes, [in] þe ende as a dunge hil [he] schal be destruyed.'</P>
<P>Also, pride gendereþ stryues, for þe Wise Man seiþ
<LB/>(Pro.11.[2]): Vbi sunt superbia, ibi et contumelia; vbi autem
<LB/>humilitas, ibi et sapientia. Þat is: 'Þere as pride is, þere is strife;
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="340"/> and þere as mekenesse is, þer is wisdom.' And, in anoþer place
<LB/>(13 chapitre [10]): Inter superbos semper iurgia sunt. 'Among
<LB/>proude men euer more ben stryues.'</P>
<P>Also, pride schal confounde men in þe Dai of Dom, whanne
<LB/>þei schul seie: 'What profitede to vs pride, or ȝaf to vs
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="345"/> boostynge of richessis? Al þo þyngis ben now passid as
<LB/>schadue.'</P>
<P>Also, proude men ben hatid boþe of God and men, as þe
<LB/>Wise Man seiþ (Ecci.10.[7]): Odibilis coram Deo et hominibus est
<LB/>superbia. Þat is: 'Pride is hatable to God and men.' And suche
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="350"/> men God hiȝli schal punysche, for Dauid seiþ: 'He schal ȝelde
<LB/>plenteuousli to hem þat doþ pride.' And Seint Jame seiþ (4
<LB/>chapitre [6]): Deus superbis resistit; humilibus autem dat gratiam.
<LB/>Þat is: 'God wiþstondeþ to proude men; and to meke m<SUPPLIED>e</SUPPLIED>n he
<LB/>ȝeueþ grace.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="355"/> Þe proude man mai wel be likened to a beere: for þanne
<LB/>aboue it is maad gaie, whanne a deed man or a womman is putt
<LB/>þerynne; so men and wymmen <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="103r"/> þanne nameli maken gaie þe
<LB/>beere of hire soule (þat is, hire bodi) wiþ gaie garnementis,
<LB/>whanne þe soule wiþynne is deed bi pride.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="360"/> Pride also mai be likened to an vnwar wrasteler: for if in
<LB/>wrastelynge oon of þe wrastelers mai rere þe foot of þe toþer,
<LB/>sone after he casteþ him. So, if þe fend mai rere þe affeccion of
<LB/>a man bi pride, anon he þroweþ him into euerlastynge dampnacioun.
<LB/>Þerfore seiþ Dauid: 'Þou hast caste hem doun while þei
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="365"/> weren arerid.'</P>
<P>Also, a proude man mai wel be lickned to a tree þat is callid
<LB/>Yuy, for Iuy haþ þis kynde: as longe as it haþ hous, wal, or tree,
<LB/>or any þynge to holde hit bi, it stieþ euermore hiere and hiere,
<LB/>til it come to þe hiest place; but whanne he haþ noȝt to holde
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="370"/> him bi, þanne crokeþ [he] doun aȝen, for he is not myȝti to
<LB/>kepe himself. And þis Iuy is not able to be no timbir in no
<LB/>mannes hous, but it serueþ most to getis mete. Riȝt so proude
<LB/>men, al þe while þat þei haue any þyng to lyue on, oþer on
<LB/>lordschipe, oþer rauayne, extorcion, þefte, oþer borwynge, þei

<LB/>but whanne hir hold bigynneþ to faile, þanne þei ben not

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="420"/> synnes:</P>
<P>First: pride, for þe Wise Man seiþ (Ecci.21.[5]): Domus que

<LB/>to riche schal be brouȝt to noȝt wiþ pride.'</P>
<P>Þe seconde: for it is moder of enuy, for þe Wise Man seiþ in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="425"/> his prouerb (Prouer.[28.22]): Vir qui festinat ditari et inuidet

<LB/>maad riche and haþ enuye to oþere, he wot not þat nede schal

<P>Þe þridde hit gendreþ: wraþþe, for it telleþ in þe first booke
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="430"/> of Hooli Writt (Gen.13.[7]) þat þer was made striȝfe bitwene þe
<LB/>herdes of Habraham and Loth his cosyn for multiplyynge of
<LB/>hire beestes.</P>
<P>Þe fourþe: for it bryngeþ forþ slouþe, for Crist telleþ in þe
<LB/>gospel (Lu.12.[19]) howȝ þe riche man seide to himself: 'Mi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="435"/> soule, þou hast many goodes putt into many ȝeris; reste, ete,

<P>Þe fifþe: it gendreþ glotenye, as Crist scheweþ in þe gospel of

<P>Þe sixte: it is noreschynge of lecherie, for þus it was seide in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="440"/> Hooli Scripture to Salamon: Collegisti quasi auricalcum aurum;

<LB/>after: 'þou boudest þyne hipes to wymmen.'</P>
<P>Ȝet also þis synne ouȝte to be hatid for þe manyfold cursis þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="445"/> God ȝeueþ in Holi Writte to þes riche men þat geten worldeli
<LB/>godes falseli, or holdeþ hem to streiteli, or loueþ hem to hertili.</P>
<P>Firste, God curseþ to suche bi Ysaie þe prophete (5.[8]) þere
<LB/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="104v"/> he seiþ þus: Ve qui coniungitis domum ad domum, et agrum agro
<LB/> copulatis. Þat is: 'Wo to ȝou þat ioyneþ hous to hous bi fals
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="450"/> couetise, and coupleþ felde to felde.' Also, he seiþ bi þe
<LB/>prophete Abachuch: Ve qui multiplicant non sua. 'Cursid be þei
<LB/>þat multiplyen þo þyngis þat ben not hiris.' Also, he seiþ bi his
<LB/>prophete Ysaie [33.1]: Ve qui predaris; nonne et ipse predaberis?
<LB/>Þat is: 'Cursid be þou þat robbest; wheþer þou schalt not be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="455"/> robbid?' Also, Crist seiþ in þe gospel (Luc.6.[24]): Ve vobis
<LB/>divitibus, qui habetis hic consolacionem vestram. 'Curside be ȝe
<LB/>riche men, þat here haueþ ȝoure conforte.' Also, þe apostle
<LB/>Judis seiþ: Ve illis, qui in via Caym abierunt. 'Cursid be þei þat
<LB/>gon in Caymes weie', þat first couetise bigan. Also, þe Wise
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="460"/> Man seiþ (Ecci.10.[9]): Auaro nihil est scelestius. 'No þyng is
<LB/>cursider þan þe couetus man.' And þerfore, for þese cursis and
<LB/>many mo þat God ȝeueþ to couetous men, þis synne of couetise
<LB/>is to be hatid.</P>
<P>Also, kynde stireþ vs to hate þis synne, seþþe mannes soule
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="465"/> þoru his kynde is hiere and clannere þan heuene; for he is maad
<LB/>like to þe Trinite, whiche ouȝte here to be hied fro erþeli
<LB/>þyngis as heuene is hiȝe fro erþe. A wonder þynge it were, and
<LB/>aȝens kynde, þat heuene scholde neiȝhe þe erþe. So it semeþ
<LB/>aȝen kynde þat couetise schulde brynge a mannes soule doun so
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="470"/> lowe to erþeli þyngis to make him loue hem, and on hem sette
<LB/>his triste. Þerfore God haþ sette þe erþe so lowe, as vilist
<LB/>element þat men schulden defoule wiþ feet and despise hit.
<LB/>And, in token herof, hooli fadris in þe bigynnynge of þe
<LB/>cherche, tauȝte bi þe Hooli Goost, solden erþeli possessiouns
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="475"/> and þrewen þe price to þe apostles feet.</P>
<P>Þe couetous man is like to þe see, to deeþ, and to helle. Þe
<LB/>see <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="105r"/> drynkiþ al þe watres of þe world; so þe couetous mannes
<LB/>wille swoleweþ alle þe richessis of þe world, þerfore he is þus
<LB/>vnsaciable (þat is, vnable to be fulfillid). He is likened also to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="480"/> deeþ and to helle, for þei beþ neuer fillid, þe toon sleynge and
<LB/>þe toþer swolewynge. Þerfore þe prophet Abachuc seiþ of þe
<LB/>couetous man (Aba.2.[5]): Dilatauit quasi infernus animam
<LB/>suam, et ipse quasi mors non adimplebitur. Þat is: 'He haþ
<LB/>enlargid as helle his soule, and he as deþ schal not be fulfillid.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="485"/> And, for þe same cause, he is likened to a dropesi man, for þe
<LB/>more þat h<SUPPLIED>e</SUPPLIED> drynkiþ, þe more he firstiþ.</P>
<P>Whi þanne þat a couetous mannes herte mai neuer be fillid
<LB/>mai be schewid bi diuerse resouns. First is þis: if a man were
<LB/>sore afirst and he hadde bisides him a tunne ful [of] wyne, þouȝ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="490"/> he drowe oute al þis wyne into anoþer vessel and putte non in
<LB/>his mouþe, his first scholde neuere þe more be quenchid or
<LB/>stanchid. So þe couetous mannes herte þat firsteþ after þe
<LB/>richessis of þis world, þouȝ he fille wiþ hem his whicchis vp to
<LB/>þe brerdes, [h]is herte þerfore is neuer þe more fillid, but more
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="495"/> desireþ.</P>
<P>Þe seconde resoun is þis: if a man bisied him faste, for to fille
<LB/>a gret berne wiþ oo corn of senevi, riȝtfulli of alle men he myȝte
<LB/>be holde a fool. So als is þat man þat weneþ to fille his
<LB/>soule wiþ failynge richessis of þis world, for mannes soule is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="500"/> wiþouten ende, and so no þynge þat haþ ende mai fille so laarge
<LB/>a þynge, and no þyng mai fille mannes soule but oneli God,
<LB/>which is also endeles.</P>
<P>Þe 3 resoun is þis: if a man bisili axide <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="105v"/> and souȝte for to fille
<LB/>a boket ful of wisdom, wheþer <SUPPLIED>þis</SUPPLIED> question of wise men
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="505"/> schulde not be holde fol and vnpertynent, for þat vessel is not
<LB/>apte ne acordaunt to receyue wisdom. So, of men þat ben lad bi
<LB/>resoun, suche a man schulde be hoolden a fool þat weneþ to
<LB/>fulfille his soule wiþ richessis, for it is not apte to receyue
<LB/>goodes of þis world, but wisdam of þe Fadir, comynge fro
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="510"/> aboue.</P>
<P>Þe 4 resoun is þis: if þer were a greet fier whiche þou woldest
<LB/>fayn sleke, and þou leidest þerto mo drie schides, wise men
<LB/>wolden holde þe for a fool for, after þat, þe more kenliere it
<LB/>wolde brenne. So a mannes herte, þat hote brenneþ wiþ þe fier
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="515"/> of couetise, þe mo godes þat he rakeþ togedere, þe more it
<LB/>setteþ his herte afiere. Þerfore seiþ þe Wise Man (Ecci.14.[9]):
<LB/>Insatiabilis est oculus cupidi. Þat is: 'Þe iȝe of þe couetous man is
<LB/>vnable to beo fillid.' And also he seiþ, in anoþer place: Avarus
<LB/>non implebitur pecunia. 'Þe couetus man schal not be fulfillid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="520"/> wiþ moneie.' Also þe Wise Man seiþ in prouerb
<LB/>(Prouer.30.[15]): Tria sunt insatiabilia, et quartum est quod
<LB/>numquam dicit: sufficit. Þat is: 'Þre þyngis þer ben þat ben
<LB/>vnable to be fulfillid, and þe fourþe þat neuer seiþ "Hoo!"' --
<LB/>þat is, þe couetous mannes herte, et cetera.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="525"/> Also, couetise of worldeli mennes goodes mai wel be likened
<LB/>to a dunge hil: for as a dunge hil þat is gaderid togidere roteþ
<LB/>and stynkeþ, and whanne it is sprad abrood it makeþ feeldes for
<LB/>to bere frute, so þe richessis of a couetous man þat ben gaderid
<LB/>togedere and leide vp to roten þe soule and makeþ it stynke in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="530"/> þe siȝt of <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="106r"/> God, and whanne þei ben sprad abrod to pore men,
<LB/>þei norischen hem and geten remission to þe soulis of riche
<LB/>men. Þerfore seiþ Crist, in þe gospel: Facite vobis amicos, et
<LB/>cetera. 'Makeþ ȝouȝ frendes of þe goodes of wickidenesse' -- þat
<LB/>is, whiche for þe more part bryngeþ men to wickidenesse. And
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="535"/> of þis dunge hil spekiþ [Ezekiel] þe prophete ([7] chapitre [19]),
<LB/>þere he seiþ þus: Aurum eorum in sterquilinium erit. 'Hire gold,'
<LB/>he seiþ, 'schal be to hem a dunge hil.'</P>
<P>Also, couetise mai wel be lickned to a postyn: for a postyn
<LB/>þanne is perelous whanne it is nyȝe þe herte, so richessis þenne
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="540"/> ben perelous and dedli whanne man setteþ on hem herteli loue.
<LB/>Þerfore seiþ Dauid: Diuitie si affluant, et cetera. 'If richesses
<LB/>flowen to ȝow, setteþ not ȝoure hertes on hem.'</P>
<P>Also, a riche man is likened to a woute or a moldwarpe: for
<LB/>he is blac bi wickidnesse and synne, and blynd bi ignorance. As
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="545"/> manie possessions as he haþ, so many biriels he haþ, in whiche
<LB/>he birieþ himselfe bi contynuel bisynesse. And as myche as he
<LB/>delueþ he þroweþ aboue him, for þe goodes þat he loueþ so
<LB/>passyngli he makeþ his god.</P>
<P>Also, a couetous man mai wel be likned to a somer hors þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="550"/> bereþ a lordes tresour: whanne he is al tobroke wiþ trauaile þat
<LB/>he haþ vsid, þenne þe tresour þat he baar is holli fro him take,
<LB/>and no þyng he leueþ him of þat he baar for his long trauaile,
<LB/>but bare weri sides, crachi feet, and gallid bac. Riȝt so, þe
<LB/>couetous man, þat kepeþ togedere worldeli godes þat heuy on
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="555"/> him lieþ, and pyneþ him sore wiþ many angris, wiþ sorwe, and
<LB/>drede, and perel of deþ; at þe laste ende, he schal not haue <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS A)" N="106v"/> of
<LB/>alle his trauaile but leeste, as a wrecche in pouerte and peyne,
<LB/>and born to þe erþe wiþ bare sides saue a wrecche schete.</P>
<P>Also, he mai be likned to a scheep þat bereþ wolle: for al þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="560"/> he al þe ȝer gadereþ atte laste is clene fro him taken, and he
<LB/>bileue nakid and oþer þerof han cloþes.</P>
<P>Also, he mai be likened to an oxe þat sore is pyned and
<LB/>fordryuen in þe plouh, oþer eten þe corn þat he traueleþ fore,
<LB/>and leueþ him noȝt to his part but vnneþe þe chaf.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="565"/> Þerfore seiþ Seint Poule ([1] ad Thi.6.[7]): Nichil intulimus in
<LB/>hunc mundum; haut dubium nec aliquid auferre possumus. Þat is:
<LB/>'No þyng,' he seiþ, 'we brouȝten into þis world; ne no doute ne no
<LB/>þyng we moun bere hennes.'</P>
<P>Seþþe þanne couetise is so perelous, as is schewid here
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="570"/> bifore, it were þanne grete wisdom wiseli to be war þerof, as
<LB/>Crist warneþ in þe gospel and seiþ (Lu.12.[15]): 'Biholdeþ, and

<LB/>þanne schulle we haue þongke of God, help of alle seyntis, and
<LB/>þe endeles blisse of heuene.</P>
<P>First, þonke of God, for he seiþ in þe gospel: 'Þat ȝe doþ to

<P>Þen, when þe feend seeþ þat he may no þing auayle wiþ his

<LB/>vncoupliþ vpon h[i]m his rennyng houndis, to renne at him
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="130"/> wiþ open mouþis; or ellis lett slip his grehoundis to hym, for to

<P>By þese rennyng houndis þat rennen wiþ open mouþe

<LB/>And þese þe deuel vncoupliþ oft vpon good men þat wolden

<LB/>to sle her soulis, for Crist seiþe by men þat ben pacient, 'in her

<P>And, for to counfort his houndis in þis werke, he blowiþ his

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> in þat cursid werke.</P>
<P>Of þese cursid mouþis þat ben þus open of þe deuelis

<P>Lo! in þis maner þe deuel huntiþ wiþ his rennyng houndis to

<LB/>hym, openly cursing hym, defamyng him, and falsly disclaundring
<LB/>him, and ȝit opened he neuer his mouþe to sey ony
<LB/>wickid worde aȝeyn. Of þese houndis spekiþ Dauid, in þe
<LB/>persone of Crist, seying þus: 'Many houndis han gon aboute;
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="165"/> þe counsel of wickid han bisegid me.' And of his pacience
<LB/>spekiþ Ysay þe prophete, seying: 'As a shepe led to þe sleing,
<LB/>he opened <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="74v"/> neuer his mouþe.' And Seint Petre seiþe þat 'when

<P>Also, as I seide, þe deuel huntiþ a man þat is his prey, and

<LB/>þat ben bacbiters and priue sowers of discorde. Of þese, þe

<LB/>vnneþe a man shal fynde two or þre men speke togedir ony
<LB/>while þat anone þe secound worde or þe þrid shal be of

<LB/>hym and make hym as feyre chere as þouȝ þei wolden put h[i]m
<LB/>in her bosum, and as sone as his backe is turned of hym þei
<LB/>speken ful shrewidly! Of suche pl[e]yniþ Dauid þe prophete, in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="190"/> þe P[sauter] and seiþe: 'Vpon my backe, as vpon a stiþie, synful
<LB/>men (þat ben suche bacbiters) forgeden her malicious wille and
<LB/>drowen alonge her wickidnes þat wes of longe tyme roted in
<LB/>her hertis.' But þe veniaunce of suche <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="75r"/> sueþ sone after, seying
<LB/>þus: 'Þe riȝtwis Lorde shal smyte togedir nollis of suche synful
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="195"/> men' -- þat is, but if þei amenden hem, at þe Day of Dome
<LB/>dampne togedir boþe body and soule. And herto acordiþ
<LB/>[Dauid] in anoþer plase, seying: 'Þe priue bacbiter to his

<LB/>þe same day.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="200"/> Þe best refute aȝeyn þe rennyng of suche grehoundis is for to
<LB/>draw to couerte, for when þe prey haþe taken couerte, þe
<LB/>grehoundis mowne not harme it after. By þis couerte may wel

<LB/>Þerfore, and þou se þe deuelis grehoundis renne byhynd þee
<LB/>(þat is, his bacbiters speke yuel of þee), anone fle to þe couerte

<LB/>rehersiþ in dyuerse placis, and ȝit he forȝaue to alle his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="215"/> enemyes and preyde for hem to his Fader. So did also Seint
<LB/>Steuen, þat first wes matrid for Cristis loue. So, if þou be in þe

<LB/>to bring þee oute of charite, þen he settiþ to þi feet wiþ his

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="225"/> Boke of Lamentacions, þere he seiþe þus: Expandit rethe
<LB/>pedibus meis. Þat is: 'He haþe sprad his net to my fete.' And þis
<LB/>is þe most sotil gyn þat he haþe to deceyue man wiþ, for vnneþe
<LB/>þer is ony man so holy þat clerly can ascape þis net. Þerfore
<LB/>God warniþ his derlingis, by Ysay þe prophete, of þis net, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="230"/> seiþe þus: Populus meus, qui beatum [te] dicunt, ipsi te decipiunt.
<LB/>Þat is: 'My peple, þei þat wiþ flatering wordis seyn þat ȝee ben

<P>Þe best remedie aȝeyn þe net of veynglorie is first to prey

<P>When synful man seeþ þat þe cause of þe comyng of oure

<LB/>to aske mercy for his synful soule as she did for hire seke

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="265"/> synful man repentaunt þat is in wille to leue his synne, and
<LB/>preyeþ deuoutly to God for mercy, whiche is goostly helþe for a
<LB/>synful soule. Chanaan is as myche to seye as 'penitens', þat is:
<LB/>forþinking, or comutatus, þat is: 'chaungid', whiche may wel be

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="270"/> [out of] synful wille [into wille] to lyue vertuously.</P>
<P>But whoso wole able hym to prey to God for his synful soule,
<LB/>he most go oute wiþ þis woman of Chanane, and folowe Crist,
<LB/>criyng bisile after hym. In what maner he shulde go oute wes
<LB/>tolde of God, in figure, to oure fader Abraham (Gen[esis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="275"/> 12.1]): 'Go oute,' he seide, 'of þi londe, <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="76v"/> and of þi kynrede,

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="295"/> þe son of Dauid, for my soule is traueilid yuel wiþ a feend.' In
<LB/>þese wordis ben vnderstonden many condicions whiche ben
<LB/>nedful in effectual shrift:</P>
<P>Þe first is þat a man haue sadde bileue, þat is: þat God onely
<LB/>may forȝiue synnis. For 'wiþouten bileue, it is impossible to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="300"/> plese God,' as Seint Poule seiþe, whiche is notid in þis worde
<LB/>'Lorde', when she seide 'Lorde, haue mercy on me'. For, as
<LB/>clerkis knowen wel, when a worde is seide by þe self, it is taken
<LB/>for þe most famous; and so þis worde 'Lorde', by þe self,
<LB/>bytokeniþ Lorde of alle Lordis, <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="77r"/> þat is: God, to whom oonly
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="305"/> longiþ mercy and forȝiuenes of synnes, as þe gospel witnesiþ:
<LB/>Quis potest dimiterre peccata, nisi solus Deus? Þat is: 'Who may
<LB/>forȝyue synnis, but oonly God?'</P>
<P>Þe secound is tristi hope of mercy, whiche is notid in þat þat
<LB/>she seiþe 'haue mercy on me'. For, wiþouten tristi hope, sorow
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="310"/> of hert, ne shrift of mouþe, ne satisfaccion, auaylen not, for
<LB/>þese þre in a maner had Judas. First sorow of þe hert, as þe
<LB/>gospel seiþe ([Mt.27.3]): 'when he saw [þat] Jesus wes
<LB/>dampned, him forþouȝt þat he had done.' And in a maner he
<LB/>made satisfaccion, for he brouȝt hem aȝeyn þe xxx penys þat he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="315"/> toke. And he had shrift of mouþe when he seide: 'I haue
<LB/>synnid.' But him lackid hope of mercy, and þerfore it came to
<LB/>an yuel eend, for he wente and heng himself.</P>
<P>Þe þrid is þat a man haue charite, being sory and preying for
<LB/>oþer mennys synnis as for his owne, whiche is notid in þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="320"/> worde 'haue mercy on me, for my douȝter is yuel traueilid of a
<LB/>feend'. For in þis preyer she arettid þe sekenes of hir douȝter to
<LB/>be hire owne, and so euery true membre of God knyttid to his
<LB/>breþeren wiþ þe senowis of charite owiþ þus to fele and bere þe
<LB/>sekenes of synne of his broþer in himselfe as his owne, wiþ pite
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="325"/> and compassion. And þus did Seint Poule þere he seiþe þus:
<LB/>Quis infirmatur et ego non infirmor? Quis scandalizatur et ego non
<LB/>vror? Þat is: 'Who is seke and I am not seke?' -- as who seiþe
<LB/>'none', or 'Who is sclaundrid and I am not brent?' -- þat is, in
<LB/>my hert, wiþ pite and compassion þat I haue on hym.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="330"/> Þe iiij condicion is þat a man acuse oonly himself, and not his
<LB/>neiȝbore, as summe men done þat tellen her neiȝboris
<LB/>synnys or shrift, and leuen her owne, ȝe! þouȝ her neiȝboris <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="77v"/>
<LB/>haue ȝouen hem no lettris of atourne to seie for hem in þat caas!
<LB/>Þis condicion is noted in þis worde 'my douȝter', and of þis also
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="335"/> spekeþ þe prophete Dauid in þis wise: Domine, vitam meam
<LB/>annunciaui tibi. 'Lorde,' he seiþe, 'myn owne lijf and none
<LB/>oþer mannys I haue schewid to þee.'</P>
<P>Anoþer [condicion] is þat a man in his owne repentaunce
<LB/>holde euer his owne synne greet; for euery synne is aȝeyn
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="340"/> summe comaundement of God, and breking of ony comaundement
<LB/>of God is greet and not litel, hauynge rewarde to þe
<LB/>worþines of þe lordis comaunding, and to þe vnworþines and
<LB/>[contempte] of þe seruaunt breking. And þerfore seide Dauid:
<LB/>Iniquitates mee supergresse sunt caput meum, et sicut onus graue
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="345"/> grauate sunt super me, et cetera. Þat is: 'My wickidnessis ben
<LB/>gone fer aboue my heed, and as a greuous birþen þei han ben
<LB/>greued vpon me.' Þis condicion is noted in þat worde male --
<LB/>þat is: 'yuel'.</P>
<P>Anoþer condicion is þis: þat a man bileue þat euery synne
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="350"/> comeþ prinspaly of þe feend, and none of God, as þei þat seyne
<LB/>in excusacion of hemself: 'it wes my desteny, or þe sterre of my
<LB/>birþe; it wes shapid to me tofore ony cloþe', turnyng þus þe
<LB/>feendis temptacion and her owne foly consenting into God.
<LB/>And þat euery synne deedly prinsepaly comeþ of þe feend
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="355"/> preueþ wel þe Wyse Man þat seiþe: Inuidia diaboli mors

<P>In þis þat þe woman seide (þat hir douȝter wes traueiled wiþ

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="365"/> rehersiþ in his gospel of a man þat brouȝt his childe to þe

<P>And in þis place is a foule confusion, if þei loke wel to suche

<P>Also, we may lerne here to do prinspaly þe dedis of mercy,

<LB/>'Jesus wes þrowing oute a feend, and it wes doumbe', et cetera.</P>
<P>The effect of þis gospel stondiþ in þre þingis. First, in a
<LB/>myracle whiche Crist did in þrowing oute of a feend of a man,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="5"/> whiche made him doube, deef, and blynde. The secounde
<LB/>parte telliþhow perilous it is, after þat a an haþe put oute þe

<LB/>deuoutly þe worde of God, and kepe it, and worche þerafter.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="10"/> As for þe first, ȝee shullen vnderstonde þat God þrew oute þe
<LB/>feend of heuen, and of þe worlde, and þrew him into helle.</P>
<P>First, he þrew hym oute of heuen for his hiȝe stinking pride,
<LB/>siþen he þat wes made so feire aboue his felawis helde him not
<LB/>apaied wiþ þat state, but desirid to stie hiȝer and hiȝer and be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="15"/> made like to God hymself, þerfore it wes resonable þat he were
<LB/>þrowen oute of þat worþi plase and feire felawship. And
<LB/>þerfore seide God to hym þus in Holy Scripture: Peccasti, et
<LB/>ei[i]eci te de monte Dei et perdidi te, O cheup. Þat is: 'O, þou
<LB/>feire aungel of þe ordre of cherubym! Þ hast synned and I
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="20"/> haue þrowen þee out of þe hil of God' (þat is, heuen), as a
<LB/>mysproude harlot þat fouliþ al þe felauship.</P>
<P>God also þrew þe feend oute of þe worlde as hym þat had
<LB/>longe holden a wrongful possession, for þorow his lesing he
<LB/>deceyuid mankynde of his heritage and helden hym in prison
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="25"/> til þe comyng of Crist þat wes riȝtful eyre of Adames innocence.
<LB/>Of þis casting oute spekiþ Crist in þe gospel
<LB/>(Jo.[12.31]), ad seiþe þus: Nunc princeps huius mundi ei[i]cietur
<LB/>foras. <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="81v"/> Þat is: 'Now þe prince of þis worlde shal be þrowen

<LB/>worlde, in whom þe deuel regniþ as a prince in his rewme.</P>
<P>And after þis, þe deuel wes þrowen of God into helle. As he
<LB/>þat takiþ vp wrongfully þe kingis state in his rewme (and þe
<LB/>kyng lyuing) is worþi to be deed or dampned to perpetual
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="35"/> prison, so þe feend wes worþi þe same iugement for þe same
<LB/>cause. Of þis þrowing oute spekiþ Jeremy þe prophete: Ei[i]ce
<LB/>illos a facie mea, et egrediantur. Quod si dixeri[nt] ad te: Quo
<LB/>egrediemur? Dices ad eos: Qui ad mortem, [ad mortem]; qui ad

<P>Herto may be answerid þat by þre maner of speche þou maist

<P>First, he spekiþ effectuely for himself. Þat is, þo þingis þat
<LB/>he spekiþ wiþ his mouþe, he doþe þe same in werke. And þus

<LB/>by me.' But many men ben like to a cros þat stondiþ in þe

<P>Also, he spekiþ truly anentis his breþeren, not deceyuing
<LB/>hem þorow no sotil wordis, but þat alwey his herte and his

<P>Also, suche a man of whom þe feend is cast oute spekiþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> honestly anentis God and þe worschip of God. And of suche
<LB/>spekiþ Peter in his canoun, seying þus: Si quis loquitur, quasi

<P>And þus, as I haue shewid, whoso spekiþ in þese þre maners

<P>First, he þat is in deedly synne is blynde, for he seþe not hou
<LB/>he is oute of þe weye of heuen and is in þe weye to helle. He
<LB/>seþe not what grace he haþe lost, and what peyne he haþe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> purchasid. He seeþ not how he haþe forsaken his Fader, God,
<LB/>and bytaken him to þe feend. Who is more blynde þen suche

<LB/>enmy, in whom is alle shrewidnes and wole bring him for his
<LB/>seruice to þe peyne of helle.</P>
<P>Euery suche man is doumbe. But here men mosten vnderstond
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> þat þere is doumbnes boþe vertuous and vicious. Vertuous,
<LB/>as summe men ben doumbe þorow þe vertu of pacience,
<LB/>as þei þat wolen not answere to wickid wordis and repreuable
<LB/>þat ben seide to h[e]m. Wherfore in þe persone of suche is seide
<LB/>in þe Psalme: Ego autem tamquam surdus non audiebam, et sicut
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> mutus non aperiens os suum. Þat is: 'I, as deef man, herde not
<LB/>repreues seide to me, and I, as doumbe man, not openyng my
<LB/>mouþe to answere ony yuel worde aȝeyn.' Þerfore <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="84r"/> suche ben

<LB/>Also, summe men ben doumbe þorow þe vertu of prudens, as

<LB/>'A wyse man shal be stille til he se tyme' -- þat is, for to speke.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="165"/> And Seint Jame seiþe (Ja.1.[19]): Sit autem omnis homo velox

<P>Þere is also, as I seide, doumbenes þat is vicious, whiche is
<LB/>vnderstonden by þis man here whiche, as þis gospel makiþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="170"/> mencion here, þat þe feend made doumbe. And þis doumbnes
<LB/>comounly is in þre maners, as summe men ben doumbe fro
<LB/>true confession to God and man of her synnis. And suche,
<LB/>when þei comen in Lenton to þe prest to confession, þei knelen
<LB/>stille tofore þe prest and wolen seie no worde, as a doumbe man
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="175"/> þat myȝt not speke. And suche ben like to a bytore þat, when
<LB/>he sittiþ on þ drie londe, he holdiþ vp his heed and makiþ no

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="180"/> speke no worde to knouleche her synnis, but when þei sitten at

<P>And þe cause of þis doumbnes is for þe deuel þat is wiþinne
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="185"/> hem haþe stopped her mouþis wiþ shame, and þen þe deuel
<LB/>whitiþ hem þat he borowid bifore. For tofore þat a man synniþ,
<LB/>he haþe shame to synne. And þe deuel seeþ þat, and borowiþ of
<LB/>him þat shame and so, when shame is gone, þen falliþ he into

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="190"/> þat shame fro hym. But at Lenton, when þe deuel seþe þat he
<LB/>shulde shryue hym of his synne, þen bringiþ he home shame

<P>Aȝeyns þis shame and þis doumbnes counseliþ þe Wyse Man,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="195"/> seying þus: In tempore infirmitatis ostende conuersacionem tuam,

<LB/>Þat is: 'In tyme of sekenes (þat is, goostly þorow synne) shew þi

<P>Also, þei ben viciously doumbe þat, for þe greet synnis þat

<P>And þus, in þis maner as it sumwhat shewid here tofore, þe

<LB/>blynde, doumbe, and deef.</P>
<P>I seide at þe biginnyng þat þe secound parte of þis gospel
<LB/>makiþ mencion how perilous it is, aftru þat a man haþe put
<LB/>oute þe feend of his soule þorow leuing of his synne, <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="87r"/> to turne
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="300"/> aȝeyn after to his synne, as proueþ pleynly þe wordis of þe text,
<LB/>whiche seien þat after þat a man haþe so done þe last þingis of
<LB/>suche a man ben made worse þen þe first. Suche a man, falling
<LB/>aȝeyn to his synne, is a watrie place to þe feend, in whiche he
<LB/>delitiþ for to dwelle, for as water flowiþ in his lustis and is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="305"/> made vnstable by synne. Of suche seiþe þe prophete Jeremy
<LB/>(Tr.1.[8]): Peccatum peccauit Ierusalem, propterea instabilis
<LB/>facta est. Þat is: 'Jerusalem haþe synned, þerfore it is made
<LB/>vnstable.' But a stable man and a stedfast whiche, after þat he
<LB/>haþe forsaken his synne turneþ not to synne aȝeyn, is a drie
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="310"/> plase by whiche þe deuel wandriþ seching rest and fyndiþ not.
<LB/>and in suche on, for his stablenes, he fyndiþ no plase to abide
<LB/>in.</P>
<P>Many resonable bodily ensaumplis a man myȝt shewe, if he
<LB/>had tyme, to meue a man to hate þis synne of falling aȝeyn, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="315"/> for to shew by reson hou perilous it is. But summe of hem a
<LB/>man may touche.</P>
<P>If it were so þat a childe trespasid to his fader, and after his
<LB/>fader forȝaue him vpon a condicion þat he trespasid so no
<LB/>more, if after þe childe toke none hede þerfore, but falle into þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="320"/> same trespas, þen þis secound trespas were more greuous to þe
<LB/>fader and myche more worþi to be punisshed þen þe first. Riȝt
<LB/>so it is of oure gostly fader God, and of his goostly children.</P>
<P>Also, if a man be onys woundid and helid, and afterward in
<LB/>þe same place be woundid, þen þe secound wounding is worse
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="325"/> þen þe first and more hard to be helid, for þe olde feblenes and
<LB/>þe new hirting ben more greuous þen þe olde by þe selfe.</P>
<P>Also, a man <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="87v"/> þat is onys poysound and by medicynis castiþ it
<LB/>oute and is delyuerid þerof, if he dronke after þe same
<LB/>venoum þat he caste oute, he is wors poysond þen he wes first.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="330"/> For after þe first casting oute, þe venoum is more fouler and
<LB/>violent for to sle þen it wes tofore.</P>
<P>Also, suche turnyng aȝeyn to synne doþe many harmys to
<LB/>man. First, it makiþ him foule in þe siȝt of God, for when he
<LB/>doþe so he haþe boþe his olde synne and new and, wiþ þat,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="335"/> rotiþ and stinkiþ in synne. And þat seiþe God openly by þe
<LB/>prophete Jeremy (2 chapitre [36]), seying þus: Quam vilis facta
<LB/>es nimis, iterans vias tuas. Þat is: 'Hou greetly foule arte þou
<LB/>made, goyng aȝeyn þi weies', by putting synne to synne. And of
<LB/>her gostly roting spekiþ Dauid in þis wyse: Putruerunt et
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="340"/> corrupte sunt cicatrices mee. Þat is: 'Myn olde borsten oute
<LB/>woundis han rotid and ben corrupt from þe face of my folie.'</P>
<P>Also, þis s[yn]ne causeþ a hardines and a maner of impossibilite
<LB/>to rise aȝeyn to grace, for þe postle seiþ (Heb.6[4-6]):
<LB/>Impossibile est eos qui semel sunt illuminati, et cetera. Þat is: 'It is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="345"/> impossible hem þat ben onys liȝtned and han tastid heuenly
<LB/>ȝiftis by sorow and penaunce doing, and after fallen aȝeyn to þe
<LB/>same synne, eft to be renued to penaunce,' for no doute it is ful
<LB/>harde and impossible to þe comyn cours of man, but not to
<LB/>God, for to him alle þingis ben possible.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="350"/> Anoþer myscheue also in þis synne is for þis synne, by
<LB/>custom and malice, hardiþ a mannys hert, as it did King
<LB/>Pharao, þat forþouȝt hym for a tyme and after fel aȝeyn to <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="88r"/>
<LB/>synne til his hert wes hardid, whiche after brouȝt him to his
<LB/>deeþ, boþe bodile and gostle. So it fariþ by suche men þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="355"/> fallen alwey aȝein fro synne to synne, til þei falle so depe þat
<LB/>þei kunnen no more arise, and þen dispisen Goddis mercy. Of
<LB/>þis spekiþ þe Wise Man, þere he seiþe þus: Homo, cum in
<LB/>profundum peccatorum venerit, contempnit. Þat is: 'A man, when
<LB/>he comiþ into depnes of synne, he despisiþ.' And, in figure of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="360"/> þis synne, þe wijf of Loth, [who] turned and loked aȝeyn
<LB/>aȝeins þe bidding of God, wes turned into an ymage of salt.
<LB/>Also, þis synne vnabliþ a man to þe kingdom of heuen,
<LB/>wherfore it is seide of Crist in þe gospel: Nemo autem mittens
<LB/>manum suam ad aratrum et respiciens retro aptus est regno Dei.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="365"/> Þat is: 'No man putting his honde to þe plowe and loking
<LB/>bacward is able to þe kingdom of God.', whiche is þus myche to
<LB/>meen: no man conuerted fro synne whiche after puttiþ his
<LB/>werkis to þe lawe of God and fallen aȝeyn to olde synne, is
<LB/>able to þe kingdom of God.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="370"/> And þus, by many resons it is proued hou perilous it is after
<LB/>synne is forsaken to turne aȝeyn þerto, whiche is þe mater of þe
<LB/>secound parte of þis gospel, as I seide at þe begynning. Also I
<LB/>seide at þe bigynning þat þe þrid parte of þis gospel makiþ
<LB/>mynde hou profitable it is to here þe worde of God, and kepe it,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="375"/> and worche þerafter. For he þat so doþe is blessid of God,
<LB/>whos blessing is more worþe and bringiþ more pardoun, þat is:
<LB/>more forȝyuenes of synnis, to synful soulis, and more profitiþ
<LB/>þen alle þe bullis of alle synful prelatis here <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="88v"/> in erþe, fro þe
<LB/>hiest to þe lowest, for he is verrey pastoure and bisshop of alle
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="380"/> oure soulis, þat ȝaue frely his hert blode for sauacion of his
<LB/>shepe. More pardoun it bringiþ in, for he þat is blessid of God
<LB/>for þis cause haþe, as Crist seiþe in Jonys gospel, Þe lijf þat
<LB/>euer shal laste', and shal not come into þe dome, but shal passe
<LB/>fro deeþ to lijf. and þis may no prelate graunte of his owne
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="385"/> autorite, be he neuer so greet, but oonly God himself þat seide
<LB/>þese same wordis.</P>
<P>Þis blessing bringiþ in more profite, for by it swich a man
<LB/>is blessid in his worldly goodis, and in vertuis of his soule, and
<LB/>euerlasting joyis of heuen.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="390"/> First, in his temporal goodis, as God rehersiþ to his prophete
<LB/>Moyses, in þe 28 chapitre of Deuter[onomie.5]. Herto acordiþ
<LB/>also þe first book of Scripture seying þus: Benedixit Dominus
<LB/>Ysaac and locupletatus est. Þat is: 'God blessid to Ysaac' and
<LB/>'he wes made riche.'</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="395"/> Also, he is blessid in soule in encresing of vertuis, for Dauid
<LB/>seiþ: Beatus homo quem tu erudieris, Domine, et de lege tua
<LB/>docueris eum. Þat is: 'Blessid is þat man whom þou enformest,
<LB/>Lorde, and of þi lawe techist him.' For of alle suche also seiþe
<LB/>þe same prophete: Ibunt de virtute in virtutem, donec videbitur
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="400"/> Deus deorum in Syon. Þat is: Þat is: 'Þei shullen go fro vertu to vertu,
<LB/>til þei se God of goddis in Syon' -- þat is, in þe blisse of heuen,
<LB/>into whiche blis alle suche shullen be clepid at þe Day of Dome
<LB/>'þe blessid children of þe Fader', and þere þei shullen welde for
<LB/>euer þe blessing of her Fader in ioyes wiþouten noumbre in þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="405"/> blessid place. Of whiche blessing spekiþ Crist in þe gospel
<LB/>(Luc.14.[15]) <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="89r"/> þere he seiþe þus: Beatus qui manducabit panem
<LB/>in regno Dei. Þat is: 'Blessid is he þat so haþe herde and kept þe
<LB/>worde of God here in erþe, whiche is goostly etyng þerof,

<P>Now God, for his eendles mercy, ȝyue vs grace so clenly to

<P>But ȝit, as þe gospel seiþe, after þat Crist had passid þe see,

<P>Þe sitting of Jesus in þe hil may betoken þe stable wille of

<P>Þat Crist lifted vp his yȝen and sawe þat greet multitude

<P>But allas! men may seye, by many of hem, þe wordis þat ben

<LB/>Crist made his preyouris: Oculi eorum erant grauati. Þat is: 'þe

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="95"/> Petre: Symon, dormis? Non potuisti vna hora vigilare mecum?
<LB/>Symon is as myche for to sey as 'obedience': in þe taking of þyn

<P>Ferþermore, in þe gospel, þere as Crist askid of Philip
<LB/>wherwiþ þei shulden bye breed to fede wiþ al þat peple, here
<LB/>may men lerne in what state euer þei be, be þei neuer so witty

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> Also Seint Poule seiþe in anoþer plase þat oþerwhile vnderstonding

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="125"/> knowleching of þe truþe and, if þei hadden not, þen do as Crist
<LB/>did here: teche hem þe truþe, boþe in worde and in dede.</P>
<P>Þe answere of Philip þat he ȝaue in þis mater, seying in þis

<LB/>and of decreis. And of þe perfeccion of þese two lawis may be

<LB/>hundrid is a perfite noumbur, as clerkis knowen wel, and wiþ <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="92r"/>
<LB/>al þis þei seyen a man is vnsufficient inowe for to be a

<P>And þei aleggen many colourid groundis. First, of Jeremy
<LB/>(he wes clepid to þat office), he wes ful sore adred, and seide:
<LB/>'A! A! A! Lorde God, I can not speke, for I am a childe.' And
<LB/>Marke, for drede, kit of his þombe to vnable him to presthod.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> But þe grettist ensaumple of hem alle hem þinkiþ is of oure

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> And þus þei drawen men aback wiþ her ferdful tresouns þat

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="155"/> Þat is: 'Þere is myche ripe corn, forsoþe fewe werkmen.'</P>
<P>But many men þat ben so sore aferde for to preche to þe

<P>Þat Andrew as þe gospel ferþermore seide: 'Þer is a childe

<LB/>dispisen þis breed, is tretid in þe next gospel suyng.</P>
<P>Þe cheef panteris of God, to whom longen prinspaly þe
<LB/>setting foorþe and departing of þis breed, ben alle prestis and
<LB/>alle þo þat han taken vpon hem þe office of presthod, to whiche
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="60"/> prelatis he bitoke þe office when, as M[atheu] telliþ in þe tenþe
<LB/>chapitre ([6-7]), he clepid his twelue apostlis and seide to hem:
<LB/>Ite ad oues que perierunt domus Israel. Euntes autem predicate,
<LB/>dicentes quia appropinquabit regnum celorum. Þat is: 'Goþe to þe
<LB/>shepe þat han perishid <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="96r"/> of þe hous of Israel. And goþe and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="65"/> prechiþ, seying þat þe kingdome of heuen shal nyȝe.' And herto
<LB/>acordiþ Luk (9 chapitre [1-2]): þat Jesus 'clepid togedir his
<LB/>apostlis and ȝaue hem vertu and power vpon alle feendis, and
<LB/>for to hele sekenessis, and sent hem to preche þe worde of
<LB/>God.' And to alle prestis he bitoke þis office when, as Luk telliþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="70"/> in þe X chapitre, he ordeyned oþer seuente and two disciplis,
<LB/>and sent hem tofore him to þe same office (in whiche chapitre is
<LB/>tretid and tolde to hem þe office and þe ordre of a prechoure)
<LB/>and in two degreis: þat is, apostlis and disciplis ben figurid
<LB/>bisshopis and prestis, as þe decree seiþe.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="75"/> But, alas! I drede me lest many prelatis, curatis and prestis,
<LB/>whiche shulden not oonly be as lordis pantreris to meyne, but
<LB/>more tenderly as modris to children departe of þis breed, faren
<LB/>to hem nowadayes as stepmodris to her children: þat is, if suche
<LB/>children aske breed of hem, þei shul none haue; and if
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="80"/> þei taken it hemsilf, þei shullen be beten.</P>
<P>So, if þe peple nowadayes aske of her prelatis or curatis þis
<LB/>breed (þat is, preching of þe worde of God), þei moun liȝtly
<LB/>haue a short answere and neuer fare þe better. And if þei taken
<LB/>it hemself (þat is, rede it or comoun þerof togidre), þei shullen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="85"/> be beten wiþ somonyng, cursyng, and pursuyng, and prisonyng.
<LB/>Þerfore it semeþ þat in suche placis is verified þe
<LB/>prophecie of Amos, þat seiþe in þis wise: Ecce dies venient, dicit
<LB/>Dominus, et mittam fame[m] in terram; non famem panis, neque
<LB/>sitim aque, sed audiendi verbum Domini. Þat is: '"Lo! þe dayes
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="90"/> shullen come," seiþe þe Lorde, "and I shal sende hungur into
<LB/>þe erþe; not <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="96v"/> hungur of breed, ne þirst of watur, but of hering
<LB/>of þe worde of God".' For suche hungur it semiþ þer is, greet
<LB/>pestilence in many places, and so myche peple goostly deed in
<LB/>synne. For suche slauȝter alle trwe prestis of God shulden
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="95"/> mourne and sorow wiþ Jeremy, seying þus: Quis dabit capiti
<LB/>meo aquam, et oculis meis fontem lacrimarum, vt lugeam interfectos
<LB/>populi mei. Þat is: 'Who shal ȝyue water to myn heed, and
<LB/>a wel of teeris to myn iȝen, þat I may mourne þe slauȝter of my
<LB/>peple?'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="100"/> Sum man myȝt sey: 'What is þis worde of God þat þou
<LB/>spekist of and callist "þis loof", siþen þer ben in Goddis lawe
<LB/>wordis wiþouten noumbre?' To þis may be answerid þat þis
<LB/>worde is þe worde of loue, in whiche is comprehendid al
<LB/>Goddis lawe, as Seint Poule seiþe: Plenitudo legis est dilectio.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> Þat is: 'Þe fulnes of þe lawe is loue', and þerfore Cristis New
<LB/>Lawe is clepid 'þe lawe of loue'.</P>
<P>Þis loof of breed most be departid in two. Þat is, into þe loue
<LB/>of God and of ȝoure euencristen; for in þese two, as Crist seiþe,
<LB/>hangiþ al þe lawe and prophesies. And ȝitt, ferþermore, if
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> tendir children shulden ete herof, þese ij parties mosten be
<LB/>departid in ten mossels. Þat is, þe loue of God into þre, and þe
<LB/>loue of þi breþeren into seuen; and þat makiþ ten, whiche ben
<LB/>þe Ten Comaundementis of God. And þese mossels euery
<LB/>prelate shulde departe or breke to his children, of þis lofe of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="115"/> Goddis worde, whiche is þe first lofe þat shulde be departid.</P>
<P>And here men may trete and declare þe Ten
<LB/>Comaundementis, lenger or shorter, as þei seen it is spedful. <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="97r"/></P>
<P>And alle þat eten of þis breed effectuelly, of Holy Scripture
<LB/>shullen be fulfillid, for al þing þat is necessarie to þe gouernaunce
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="120"/> of her soulis þei mowen taste and fynde þerinne. For
<LB/>þei may fynde þerinne what good vertu doþe in plesaunce of
<LB/>God and [profite] of mannys soule; and what harme synne doþe
<LB/>in displesaunce of God and hyndryng of mannys soule. And
<LB/>whoso tastiþ and feliþ þat, and on þe toþer side fyndiþ in his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="125"/> conscience þat he haþe done many synnis, þen shal he falle into
<LB/>a greet sorow for his synne, for Salamon seiþe: Qui addit
<LB/>scientiam, addit et dolorem. Þat is: 'He þat addiþ kunnyng or
<LB/>knowing, addiþ sorow' and so doþe greet penaunce in hope of
<LB/>remission, whiche is þe secound lofe of breed þat I spake of at
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="130"/> þe bygynning.</P>
<P>Of þis lofe of penaunce spekiþ Dauid in þe P[sauter], seying
<LB/>þus: Fuerunt mihi lacrime mee panes die ac nocte. Þat is: 'My
<LB/>teeris werne to me louys [day and nyȝt].' And, in anoþer place
<LB/>he seiþe: Cibabis nos pane lacrimarum. Þat is: 'Þou shalt fede vs
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> wiþ breed of teeris.'</P>
<P>Þis breed of penaunce, to him þat etiþ it wilfully and gladly,
<LB/>doþe many goodis, but prinspaly þre. First, it getiþ of God
<LB/>forȝyuenes of synnis, as witnesiþ Petre in þe Dedis of Apostlis,
<LB/>seying: Penitemini, et conuertimini vt deleantur peccata vestra.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> Þat is: 'Doþe penaunce, and beeþ conuertid, þat ȝoure synnis
<LB/>be done awey.' Also, by penaunce a soule is recounsilid to his
<LB/>heuenly spouse, hou foule þat euer he haþe broken spousehed
<LB/>wiþ, as he seiþe by þe <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="97v"/> prophete Jeremy: Tu autem fornicata es
<LB/>cum amatoribus multis; tamen, revertere et ego suscipiam te. Þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> is: 'Þou, forsoþe, hast done fornicasion wiþ many louers;
<LB/>neþeles, turne aȝeyn and I shal receyue þee.' Þe þrid is þat by
<LB/>penaunce is geten þe kyngdome of heuen, witnesing Crist
<LB/>himself and Jon Baptist, seying þus (Mt.3.[2] and 4.[17]):
<LB/>Penitentiam agite; appropinquabit enim regnum celorum. Þat is:
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> 'Doþe penaunce; þe kingdome of heuen shal nyȝe.</P>
<P>Þe pantreris whiche God haþe ordeyned to ȝyue aboute or
<LB/>departe þis lofe of penaunce ben prestis whiche he put in þis
<LB/>office when he seide þus: Quecumque ligaueritis super terram
<LB/>erunt ligata et in celis, et cetera (Mt.18.[18]). Þat is: 'Whateuer
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="155"/> þingis ȝee bynden vpon erþe shullen be bounden in heuenys;
<LB/>and whateuer þingis ȝee vnbynden vpon erþe shullen be
<LB/>vnbounden in heuenys.' And also he seiþe in anoþer place:
<LB/>Quorum remiseritis peccata, remittuntur et eis (Jo.20.[23]). Þat is:
<LB/>'Whos synnis ȝee forȝyuen, þei shullen be forȝyuen to hem; and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="160"/> whos synnis ȝee wiþholden, þei shullen be wiþholden.'</P>
<P>Þe keyis of þe pantre he bitoke hem when he seide to Petre,
<LB/>in figure of alle prestis: Tibi dabo claues regni celorem
<LB/>(Mt.16.[19]). 'Þo þee I shal ȝyue þe keyis of þe kingdome of
<LB/>heuenys.' Þese keyes, as þe Mayster of Sentence seiþe, ben
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="165"/> power and kunnyng. And þese ben so necessarie togedir þat þe
<LB/>tone wole not vnlouke wiþoute þe toþer. But, for many prestis
<LB/>taken þe keyis of power <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="98r"/> and forȝeten þe key of kunnyng,
<LB/>þerfore oft when þei wenen to loke þei vnloken, and when þei
<LB/>wenen to vnloke þei loken, as witnesiþ God by his prophete:
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="170"/> Interficiunt animas que non moriuntur, et viuificant animas que
<LB/>non viuunt (Eze.13.[19]). 'Þei sleen soulis þat dien not, and þei
<LB/>quykenen soulis þat lyuen not.' But þei þat han boþe keyes
<LB/>moun sikerly open þe dore, and sett forþe, and departe truly to
<LB/>þe peple of þis lofe of penaunce.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="175"/> First, if men shulden ete wel of þis breed, it most be broken
<LB/>into þre parties -- þat is, it most be declarid by þe prestis þat
<LB/>whoso doþe verrey penaunce, he most haue þre þingis: þat is,
<LB/>contricion, confession, and satisfaccion. And eche of þese partis
<LB/>most be broken into þre, so þat þis loof of penaunce most be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="180"/> broken into nyne mossels.</P>
<P>Of þe first mossel (þat is, contricion) spekiþ Dauid, þe
<LB/>prophete, þere he seiþe þus: Cor contritum et humiliatum, et
<LB/>cetera. Þat is: 'A contrite herte and a meke, God, þou shalt not
<LB/>despise.' And þis mossel most be broken into þre parties, as þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="185"/> doctour Lincolne seiþe, in his dictis. Þe first is hate of synne, as
<LB/>þe prophete seiþe: Qui diligitis Dominium, odite malum. Þat is:
<LB/>'Ȝee þat louen þe Lorde, hatiþ yuel.' And in anoþer plase he
<LB/>seiþe: Propterea odiui omnem viam iniquitatis. Þat is: 'Þerfore I
<LB/>haue hatid al þe weie of wickidnes.' Þe secound is contynuel
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="190"/> sorow for synne. Of þis also spekiþ þe prophete þus: Dolor meus
<LB/>in conspectu meo <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="98v"/> semper. Þat is: 'My sorow is euer in my siȝt.'
<LB/>And Austyn (De Vera Penitentia) seiþe: 'Where þat sorow
<LB/>eendiþ, feiliþ penaunce.' Þe þrid parte of contricion is ful
<LB/>purpos neuer to turne aȝeyn to synne. Þis moued Crist in þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="195"/> gospel (Jo.5.[14]), when he seide þus to þe seke man þat he
<LB/>helid: Ecce, iam sanus factus es; iam noli peccare, ne deterius tibi
<LB/>aliquid contingat. Þat is: 'Lo! now þou arte made hool; nowe
<LB/>wole þou no more synne, lest ony þing falle worse to þee.'</P>
<P>Þe secound parte of þe loof of penaunce is confession, of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="200"/> whiche spekiþ James, þe apostle (Jac.5.[16]): Confitemini alterutrum
<LB/>peccata vestra. Þat is: 'Knoulechiþ eche to oþer ȝoure
<LB/>synnis.' And þis parte most be broken into þre mossels, for
<LB/>confession most haue þese þre condicions:</P>
<P>First, it most be hasty, wiþoute delaying. Not þat a man
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="205"/> drawe along his confession til he be nyȝe his deeþ, as many men
<LB/>done, but while he is on lyue and in good hele, swich tyme as
<LB/>he haþe synned. Þerfore seiþe þe Wyse Man: Non demoreris in
<LB/>errore impiorum; ante mortem confitere, et sequitur viuus et sanus
<LB/>confiteberis. Þat is: 'Dwelle þou not in errour of wickid men;
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="210"/> knouleche þou tofore þi deeþ, and it sueþ hool and lyuing þou
<LB/>shalt knouleche.'</P>
<P>Þe secound condicion of shrift: þat is, þat it be hool wiþouten
<LB/>departing. Not a gobet to oon and a parcel to an oþer, or for to
<LB/>knouleche summe of þi synnys and leue summe behynd, for
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="215"/> God wole not departe his forȝyuenes. And þerfore it seiþe in
<LB/>Jonys gospel: Totum hominem fecit sanum. Þat is: 'Al þe man he
<LB/>made hool.'</P>
<P>Þe þrid condicion of confession is þat it shulde be nakid
<LB/>wiþouten ony excusing, as <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="99r"/> Dauid did, when he had synnid in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="220"/> noumbring of þe peple and God punshid his peple, he seide:
<LB/>Ego sum qui peccavi, ego qui malum feci. Iste grex quid commeruit?
<LB/>Þat is: 'I am þat haue synned, I þat haue done yuel. Þis
<LB/>folke, what haþe it deseruid?' And, for þis meke accusing of
<LB/>hymself in excusing of oþer, he gate forȝyuenes and plesid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="225"/> God. But Adam and Eue, Anany and Saphire, for þei excusiden
<LB/>her synne, þerfore þei gaten no forȝyuenes, but
<LB/>veniaunce and peyne. Þerfore seiþe Seint Ambrose (vpon þe
<LB/>Ps[alme] Beati immaculati): Qui se accusat, etsi sit peccator,
<LB/>iustus esse incipit. Þat is: 'He þat accusiþ himself, and þouȝ he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="230"/> be a synner, he beginniþ to be riȝtwis.'</P>
<P>Þe þrid parte of þis loof of penaunce is satisfaccion, for
<LB/>Thomas Alquin seiþ (Verit[atis] Theo[logice]): Sicut in bellis
<LB/>restituta [amicitia], statim non remittit[ur] dampnum debitum
<LB/>illati; ita post remissionem culpe in contricione, remanet debitum,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="235"/> pene satisfaccionis. Þat is: 'As in batels when frendship is
<LB/>restorid, anone þe dett of þe harme þat is done is not forȝouen;
<LB/>so, after remission of synne in contricion, leueþ dett of
<LB/>satisfaccion peyne.'</P>
<P>And þis parte (of satisfaccion) ȝit most be broken into þre
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="240"/> partes: þat is, into preyer, fasting, and almesdede. Riȝt as a man
<LB/>haþe soule, body, and goodis of fortune, and riȝt as wiþ þese he
<LB/>haþe trespasid, so wiþ þese he must make satisfaccion. As
<LB/>anentis þe soule, he most make satisfaccion wiþ preyoure;
<LB/>anentis þe body, wiþ vertuous fasting; anentis þe goodis of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="245"/> fortune, wiþ almisdede.</P>
<P>Of preyoure: sum is in hert; sum in mouþe; sum in dede. Of
<LB/>þe first seiþe Poule to þe Corinth[þis] <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="99v"/> (xiiij chapitre [15]):
<LB/>Orabo spiritu et orabo mente. Þat is: 'I shal prey in spirit and I
<LB/>shal prey in mynde.' Of þe secound seiþe James (Jac.5.[16]):
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="250"/> Orate pro invicem, vt saluemini. Þat is: 'Preyeþ eche for oþer,
<LB/>þat ȝee be sauid.' Of þe þrid seiþ Crist in þe gospel
<LB/>(Luc.1[8.1]): Quoniam oportet semper orare et non deficere. Þat is: 'For it
<LB/>bihoueþ euer to pr[e]ie and neuer to feyle.'</P>
<P>Whoso wole lengur dilate þis mater of preyoure, loke he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="255"/> more þerof in þe sermoun of Ephiphanie.</P>
<P>Þe secound parte of satisfaccion is fasting, and þat is boþe
<LB/>fruteous and vnfruituous. Fructuous in þre maners. Oon is of
<LB/>þe mouþe, þat is: abstinence fro metis, of whiche spekiþ Crist
<LB/>in þe gospel, seying þus: Cum ieiunatis, nolite fieri sicut ypocrite
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="260"/> tristes. Þat is: 'When ȝee fasten, be ȝee not made as ypocritis
<LB/>sorouful.' Þe þi is of þe hert, þat is: absteyning from vnordinate
<LB/>lustis to synnis. Þerfore seiþe Crisostom (O[m]e[lia] 5): Corporis
<LB/>quidem ieiunium est abstinere a cibis; anime autem ieiunium
<LB/>est abstinere ab omni re mala. Þat is: 'Fasting of body is for to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="265"/> absteyne fro metis; but fasting of soule is to absteyne fro al
<LB/>wickid þing.' Þe þrid fasting is of werke, þat is: absteyning fro
<LB/>wickid werkis, of whiche Seint Poule spekiþ: Ab omni specie
<LB/>mala abstinete vos. Þat is: 'Fro al maner yuel spice absteyne
<LB/>ȝou.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="270"/> Vnfructuous fasting is in þre maners. Oon is of coueitous
<LB/>men, for to fille þe purs; anoþer is of men þat lyuen after phisik,
<LB/>oonly for helþe of body; þe iþi is of ypocritis, oonly for to be
<LB/>seen.</P>
<P>Þe þrid parte of satisfaccion is almesdede. Whoso doþe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="275"/> wilfully and discretly after þe boundis of Goddis lawe, brekiþ
<LB/>wel <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="100r"/> and departiþ þe þrid loof of breed, of whiche I spake of at
<LB/>þe bigyning -- þat is, of temperal goodis for bodile sustenaunce.
<LB/>In þis maner wyse Seint Austyn vnderstondiþ 'breed' þat we
<LB/>asken of God in oure Pater Noster -- þat is, al þing þat we
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="280"/> neden of oure sustenaunce to body, as mete, and
<LB/>drinke, and hiling, and ouer þis al þat nediþ to sustenaunce of oure soulis.</P>
<P>Þis breed, if it be broken wysely and departid euenly, doþe
<LB/>many goodis, but among alle oþer þese þre first: it clensiþ [a]
<LB/>mannys synnis; and it delyueriþ a man fro deeþ þat he haþe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="285"/> deseruid for synnis; and it makiþ a man to fynde euerlasting
<LB/>lijf. Þis proueþ wel Tobie in his Boke, where he seiþe þus:
<LB/>Elemosina a morte liberat, et ipsa est que purgat peccata, et facit
<LB/>inuenire vitam eternam.</P>
<P>Þe pantreris of þis lofe ben prestis, for as Jon (Jo.[21.15-17])
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="290"/> makiþ mynde in his gospel, Crist bade Petre þries for his loue
<LB/>fede his shepe. Seint Gregorius and oþer doctouris vnderstonden
<LB/>by þis þries feding: first, wiþ his temperal goodis
<LB/>whiche þei han vnder her gouernaunce of tiþis and offringis,
<LB/>taking þerof oonly to hem a streite lyuing, as Poule writiþ to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="295"/> Thi[moþe]: Habentes alimenta et quibus tegamur, hijs contenti
<LB/>simus; 'We hauing foodis and hiling, wiþ þese be we payde.' Þe
<LB/>secound feding is wiþ good ensaumple of her lyuing. Þe þrid is
<LB/>wiþ newe techyng of Goddis worde.</P>
<P>And not oonly prestis han panteris to breke and sett forþe of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="300"/> þis breed, but also euery oþer man þat haþe plente of þis loof of
<LB/>temperal goodis. For alle suche men God haþe made his
<LB/>pantreris, and generally seide to hem þese wordis by Ysay, þe
<LB/>prophete: Frange esurienti panem tuum. Þat is: 'Breke to <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="100v"/> nedy
<LB/>þi breed' -- þat is, of worldly goodis.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="305"/> But, for þat many men oft tyme breken þis breed (þat is,
<LB/>ȝyuen almesdedis) and litel þanke han þei þerfore of þe cheef
<LB/>Lorde, þerfore it were to wite what circumstauncis ben due
<LB/>þerto to þat eend þat it myȝt plese þe Lorde and haue mede for
<LB/>his seruice. Seuen circumstauncis I fynde groundid in Scripture,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="310"/> whiche ben necessarie to riȝt almesdede. First is: what
<LB/>shal be ȝouun. Crist telliþ in þe gospel of Luke, and seiþe þus:
<LB/>Quod superest, date elemosinam. Þat is: 'Ouerplus ouer þi nedful
<LB/>lyuing, ȝyue to almes.' Þe secound is: to whom shulde almes be
<LB/>ȝouen. Crist telliþ in þe same gospel, and seiþe prinspaly to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="315"/> þese: Voca pauperes, debiles, claudos, cecos. Þat is: 'Clepe pore,
<LB/>feble, pore crokid, and pore blynde.' Þe þrid is: hou myche.
<LB/>Herto answeriþ Tobie in his Boke, and seiþe þus: Si multum
<LB/>tibi fuerit, habundanter tribue; si exiguum fuerit, etiam exiguum
<LB/>libenter impertir[i] stude. Þat is: 'If þou haue myche, ȝyue
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="320"/> plenteuously þerof; and if þou haue litel, ȝyue a litel þerof
<LB/>gladly.' Þe fourþe is: whan it shal be ȝouun. Anone, wiþoute
<LB/>tariyng, seying þus: Cor inopis ne afflixeris, et ne protrahas dare.
<LB/>Þat is: 'Ne disese þou not þe hert of þe nedy man, and draw
<LB/>þou not on long for to ȝyue to him þat is in anguysshe.' Þe fifþe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="325"/> is: why men shullen ȝyue. For þe loue of Crist. For Crist seiþe
<LB/>in þe gospel of M[atheu]: Quamdiu fecistis vni ex hijs minimis
<LB/>fratribus meis, mihi fecistis. Þat is: 'As long as ȝee han done to
<LB/>oon of þese leest my breþeren, ȝee han done to me.' Þe sixt is:
<LB/>hou it shulde be done. Þe Wyse <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="101r"/> Man answeriþ in his Boke,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="330"/> and seiþe priuely it shulde be done, seying þus: Conclude
<LB/>elemosinam in sinu pauperis, et hec pro te orabit ab omni malo.
<LB/>Þat is: 'Close þe almys in þe bosum of þe pore men, and it shal
<LB/>prey for þee fro al yuel.' Þe seuent is: of what maner goodis
<LB/>almys shulde be ȝouen. Herto answeren þe wordis of Zache in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="335"/> þe gospel of Luke, of mannys owne goodis and not wrongly
<LB/>geten, seying þus: Dimidium bonorum meorum do pauperibus. Þat
<LB/>is: 'Þe half of my goodis I ȝyue to pore men.'</P>

<LB/>perilous it is not to ȝyue credence to þe true wordis of suche a

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="20"/> The first is groundid of þe first wordis of Crist in þis gospel,

<P>And þus it semiþ by þese wordis þat þe lijf of euery

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="30"/> acordiþ Seint Poule, ȝyuing a rule of prestis and prechouris to

<P>And for þis same cause also Crist clepid his apostlis 'salt of þe

<P>Anoþer cause is þat þe peple to whom þe prechour shewiþ þe

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="75"/> for þere is no falshede ne wrong worde þerinne (as witnesiþ þe
<LB/>Wyse Man speking in þe persone of God, seying þus: Iusti sunt
<LB/>omnes sermones mei, et non est in eis aliquid prauum neque

<LB/>hem no shrewid þing ne wrong þing'), he may resonable aske of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="80"/> þe peple to whom he prechiþ, lyuing in vicis: 'If I seye truþe to

<LB/>'To byleue Goddis worde' is to byleue þat Goddis worde is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="85"/> true, and so bileuiþ þe deuel, as James seiþe: Demones credunt.
<LB/>Þat is: 'Feendis bileuen.' But 'for to bileue to þe worde of God'
<LB/>is for to bileue þat þe worde of God is true in euery parte, and
<LB/>also vertuous to lyue þerafter. And in þis maner is no man
<LB/>perfitly in byleue but he þat is oute of dedly synne, and þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="90"/> bileue is gendrid b[y] vertuous hering of þe worde <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="104v"/> of God.</P>
<P>And alle suche ben a Goddis halfe, or membris of God, as

<LB/>Goddis half heriþ þe worde of God.' But Crist after shewiþ
<LB/>cause why þat synful men han no wille to here vertuously þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="95"/> worde of God, and suyngly to bileue þerto, for þei ben not a
<LB/>Goddis halfe.</P>
<P>But here we mosten vnderstonde þat þere is fructiful hering
<LB/>of þe worde of God, and also vnfructiful.</P>
<P>Fructiful hering is when a man heriþ it wiþ bodile eeris, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="100"/> vnderstondiþ it wiþ goostly eeris, and worchiþ þerafter wiþ his
<LB/>dedis. And for to do þus, two þingis shulden prinspaly meue
<LB/>euery man. Oon is þe worþines and goodnes of þe worde of
<LB/>God. Anoþer is þe manyfolde profitis þat it bringiþ to his
<LB/>fructiful herer. The worþines and dignite of þe worde of God is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> prouid by Seint Austyn, whiche makiþ comparison bitwix þe
<LB/>worde of God and þe body of Crist, wher he seiþ þus (i'. q. d.
<LB/>Interr[og]o): 'I aske to ȝou, breþeren or sustren, seiþ to me
<LB/>what semiþ to ȝou to be more, þe body of Crist, or þe worde of
<LB/>Crist? If ȝee wolen answere truly, þus ȝee shullen seie þat þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> worde of God is not lesse þen þe body of Crist.' And after he
<LB/>seiþe in þe same place þat 'we shulden kepe it as bisile and wiþ
<LB/>as greet reuerence as we wolden þe body of Crist.'</P>
<P>And not oonly as Seint Austin seiþe it is euen wiþ þe body of
<LB/>Crist, but as Seint Jon seiþ in his gospel, it is þe secound
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="115"/> persone in þe godhed þat toke fleische in þe mayden, seying
<LB/>þus: Verbum caro factum est. Þat is: 'þe worde is made fleishe.'</P>
<P>Also, þe worþines and þe vertu of þe worde of God may be
<LB/>shewid herby, for it passiþ in worþines golde whiche is most
<LB/>precious of alle metels, <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="105r"/> and it haþe mo vertuis þen ony
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="120"/> precious ston; and þerfore seiþe Dauid þe prophete, þat knew
<LB/>perfitly þe difference bitwix hem, in þis maner: Dilexi mandata
<LB/>tua super aurum et top[az]ion. Þat is: 'I haue loued þi
<LB/>comaundementis, whiche ben þi word, aboue golde and precious
<LB/>ston.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="125"/> The hiȝe vertuis of þe worde of God ben wiþouten noumbre,
<LB/>but neþeles a man may telle whiche ben rehersid in þe glose of
<LB/>Poulis pistlis vpon þis worde (ij' ad Thimotheum 2.[9]): Verbum
<LB/>Dei non est alligatum. Þat is: 'Þe worde of God is not bounden')
<LB/>where he rehersiþ vii vertuis of þe word of God.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="130"/> Þe first is þat it liȝtniþ mannys soule and ȝyueþ him goostly
<LB/>vnderstonding, as þe prophete Dauid seiþe in þe P[sauter]:
<LB/>Declaratio sermonum tuorum illuminat et intel[lectum] dat
<LB/>paruulis. Þat is: 'Þe declaring of þi wordis liȝtneþ and ȝyueþ
<LB/>vnderstonding to meke men.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> Þe secound: it gladiþ mannys hert, as þe prophete Jere[my]
<LB/>seiþe: Factum est verbum tuum in gaudium et in leticia[m] cordis
<LB/>mei, quoniam inuocatum est nomen tuum super me (Jere.[15.16]).
<LB/>Þat is: 'Þi worde is made into ioy and gladnes of myn herte, for
<LB/>þi name is iclepid vpon me.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> Þe þrid vertu is þat it al tobrekiþ mannys harde herte by
<LB/>drede and sorow, as þe prophete Jere[my] seiþe: Numquid non
<LB/>verba mea sunt quasi ignis, dicit Dominus, et quasi malleus
<LB/>conterens petras (Jere.23.[29]). Þat is: '"Wheþer þat my wordis
<LB/>ben not as fire," seiþe þe Lorde, "and as an hamer breking
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> togider stonys."'</P>
<P>Þe fourt vertu is þis: þat it makiþ mannys harde herte to
<LB/>melte by loue into teeris, as Dauid þe prophete seiþe in þe
<LB/>P[sauter]: Emittet verbum suum et liquefaciet ea, <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="105v"/> flauit spiritus
<LB/>eius et fluent aque. Þat is: 'He shal sende oute his worde by his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> true prechoure, and he shal melte hem by loue, and his spirit
<LB/>blew (þat is, þe Hooly Goost wrouȝte in hem deuocion), and
<LB/>watris shul flow (þat is, greet plente of teeris).'</P>
<P>Þe fifþe vertu is þat it heleþ al maner goostly sþiknes of
<LB/>mennys soulis. Þat proueþ þe Wyse Man in Holy Scripture
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="155"/> þere he seiþe þus: Non herba neque malagma sanauit eos, sed tuus
<LB/>sermo, Domine, qui sanat omnia (Sap.[16.12]). 'Neiþer herbe ne
<LB/>playster helid hem, but þi worde, Lorde, þat heliþ alle þingis.'
<LB/>Also, Dauid in þe P[sauter] seiþe: Misit verbum suum et sanauit
<LB/>eos. Þat is: 'He sen[t]e his worde and helid hem.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="160"/> Þe sixt is þat it areisiþ deed men, for it reisiþ sinful men out
<LB/>of deeþ of deedly synne into goostly lijf of vertuis, witnesing
<LB/>Crist himself in þe gospel of Jon þere he seiþe þus: Venit hora,
<LB/>et nunc est, quando mortui audient vocem Filij Dei, et qui auderint
<LB/>viuent. Þat is: 'Þe houre comeþ, and now is, when deed men
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="165"/> shullen here þe voyce of þe Son of God, and þei þat heren it
<LB/>shullen lyue.'</P>
<P>Þe seuent vertu is þis: þat it delyueriþ a man from euerlasting
<LB/>deeþ. Also, as Crist seiþe in þe gospel of þis day: Si quis
<LB/>sermonem meum seruabit, mortem non gustabit in eternum
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="170"/> (Jo.[viij.51]). Þat is: 'Whosoeuer shal kepe my worde, shal not
<LB/>taste deeþ wiþouten eend.'</P>
<P>And þus, as it is sumwhat shewid, þe dignite and vertu of þe
<LB/>worde of God shulden meue men to here it riȝtfully. Þe þi þing
<LB/>þat shulde meue men to here it riȝtfully, as it is seide tofore, is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="175"/> þe manyfolde profitis þat it bringiþ to suche hereris.</P>
<P>First, it gendriþ bileue in man, as þe apostle <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="106r"/> seiþe to
<LB/>Romayns: Fides autem ex auditu, auditus autem per verbum
<LB/>Cristi. Þat is: 'Bileue comiþ of þe worde of Crist.' And
<LB/>'wiþouten bileue may no man plese God,' as þe apostle seiþ to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="180"/> þe Hebr[ues]. Þen wiþout feiþful hering of þe worde of God
<LB/>may no man plese God.</P>
<P>Þe secound profite of hering of þe worde of God is þat it
<LB/>makiþ a man to dwelle stable and stedfast vpon þe ground of
<LB/>his bileue, as witnesiþ Crist in þe gospel of M[atheu] (vij
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="185"/> [24-5]): Omnis qui audit verba mea et facit ea, assimilabitur viro
<LB/>sapienti qui edificauit domum suam supra petram; descendit
<LB/>pluuia, venerunt flumina, flauerunt venti, et irruerunt in domum
<LB/>illam, et non cecidit quia fundata erat supra petram. Þat is:
<LB/>'Euery man þat heriþ my wordis shal be made like to a wyse
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="190"/> man þat bildiþ his hous stedfast vpon a ston' -- þat is, vpon
<LB/>Crist, whiche bitokeniþ þe ston. 'And reyn descendid' -- of false
<LB/>preching. 'And flodis comen' -- of sharp persecucion. 'And
<LB/>wyndis blewen' -- of venemous diffamacion. 'And fellen vpon
<LB/>þe hous' -- þat is, aȝeyns his conuersacion þat fruytfully heriþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="195"/> þe worde of God. 'And it fel not' -- fro þe stedfastnes of his
<LB/>bileue. And whi? Certis, 'for it wes bilde vpon a stedfast
<LB/>ston' -- whiche is þe lijf of Crist.</P>
<P>Þe þrid profite þat þe worde of God bryngiþ to his eeris is
<LB/>þat [it] makiþ hem blessid of þe mouþe of God. Þis wittnesiþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="200"/> Crist himself in þe gospel of Lu[ke]: Beati qui audiunt verbum
<LB/>Dei, et custodiunt illud. Þat is: 'Blessid be þei þat heren þe
<LB/>worde of God, and kepen it.' And, as it is shewid in þe sermoun
<LB/>of þe last Sonday, þis blessing is more worþe þen alle þe synful
<LB/>prelatis blessing here in erþe.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="205"/> Þe fourþe profite is þis: þat it makiþ his fruytful herer
<LB/>commendid of God aboue hem þat done þe bodile dedis of
<LB/>mercy. For riȝt as þe soule is more <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="106v"/> perfite þen þe body, so þe
<LB/>foode of þe soule is more worþi þen þe foode of þe body; and
<LB/>siþen fedyng of þe soule is made by hering of þe worde of God,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="210"/> þerfore fruytful herers of þe worde of God ben þe more

<LB/>bodile foode, seying of hir in þis wyse: Maria optima partem
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="215"/> elegit, que non auferetur ab ea (Luc.10.[42]). Þat is: 'Marie haþe
<LB/>chosen þe better partie, whiche shal neuer be taken awey fro
<LB/>hir.'</P>
<P>Þe fifþe profite þat it doþe is þis: þat it ministriþ to a man
<LB/>greet hope þat he is þe childe of God and a membre of God
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="220"/> ordeynid to blis by þe wordis of God þat he seiþe in þis same
<LB/>gospel: Qui est ex Deo, verba Dei audit. Þat is: 'He þat is of
<LB/>Goddis parte, heriþ þe worde of God.'</P>
<P>Þe sixt profite is þis: þat it getiþ or purchasiþ to his herers
<LB/>euerlasting lijf in blis. Þis witnesiþ Crist in þe gospel of Jon,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="225"/> seying þus: Qui verbum meum audit, et credit [ei qui] misit me,
<LB/>habet vitam eternam. Þat is: 'He þat heriþ my worde, and
<LB/>byleuiþ to him þat sent me, haþe þe lijf þat euer shal laste.'</P>
<P>Þere is also, as I seide, vnfruytful hering of þe worde of God.
<LB/>Þat is, when a man heriþ it wiþ þe eeris of his body and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="230"/> takiþ no tent þerto wiþ þe eeris of his hert. Or ellis when he
<LB/>heriþ wiþ eeris of body, and vnderstondiþ it wiþ his herte, and
<LB/>lyueþ contrary þerto in his werkis. Aȝeyns þis maner of hering
<LB/>spekiþ Seynt Jame in his pistil, seying: Estote factores <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="107r"/> verbi, et
<LB/>non auditores tantum, fallentes vosmetipsos, et cetera. Þat is:
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="235"/> 'Beiþ doers of þe worde of God, and not oonly hereris,
<LB/>deceyuing ȝoureself.' Of þis vnfruytful hering of þe worde of
<LB/>God men shulden be sore afeerd, for many perilis þat comen
<LB/>þerof, and prinspaly for v:</P>
<P>First, for he þat heriþ not vertuously þe worde of God is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="240"/> cursid of þe mouþe of God, as Jeremy þe prophete witnesiþ,
<LB/>speking in þe persone of Crist: Maledictus homo qui non audierit
<LB/>verba pacti huius quod precepi patribus vestris. Þat is: 'Cursid is
<LB/>þat man þat heriþ not þe wordis of þis couenaunt þat I
<LB/>comaundid to ȝoure fadris.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="245"/> Þe secound perel is þis: for þe preyour of euery suche
<LB/>negligent herer is cursid, as witnesiþ þe Wyse Man in his
<LB/>prouerbis (Prouer.28.[9]): Qui auertit aurem suam ne audiat
<LB/>legem, oratio eius erit execrabilis. Þat is: 'He þat turneþ awey his
<LB/>eer þat he here not þe lawe of God, his preyer shal be cursid.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="250"/> Þe þrid peril is þis: for dispite of hering of þe worde of God
<LB/>is greet signe of damnacion, witnesing Crist in þis same
<LB/>gospel, seying: Propterea non auditis, quia ex Deo non estis. Þat
<LB/>is: 'Þerfore ȝee heren not, for ȝee ben not a Goddis half.'</P>
<P>Þe fourþe perel is þis: þat suche dispisers of þe worde of God
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="255"/> shullen be more bitterly dampned þen Sodomitis, for it is more
<LB/>perel to distrie goostly seed of þe worde of God by whiche
<LB/>Crist shulde be engendrid in mennys soulis þen for to distrie
<LB/>bodile seed by whiche mannys body shulde oonly be engendrid.
<LB/>Þat witnesiþ Crist himself in þe gospel of M[atheu]
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="260"/> X [15]): Amen dico vobis, tolerabilius <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="107v"/> erit terre Sodomorum et
<LB/>Gomorreorum in Die Iudicij quam illi ciuitati, et cetera. Þat is:
<LB/>'Forsoþe, I sey to ȝou, more sufferable it shal be to þe londe of
<LB/>Sodom and Gommor in þe Day of Dome þen to þe cite þat
<LB/>despisiþ þe worde of God.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="265"/> Þe fifþe perel is þis, as Seint Austyn seiþe in þe chapitre
<LB/>Interrogo þat is aleggid tofore: þat 'not lesse gylty is he þat
<LB/>negligently heriþ þe worde of God þen he þat þorow negligence
<LB/>suffriþ þe body of Crist falle into þe erþe.'</P>
<P>I seide also at þe bygynning þat þe secound parte of þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="270"/> gospel techiþ vs þat aȝeyns false wordis of sclaundris men
<LB/>shulden excuse hemself mekely wiþ perfite pacience, and
<LB/>afterward cleerly declare þe contrarie truþe. Þus did oure
<LB/>Lorde Jesus Crist, when þe Jewis puttiden vpon him false
<LB/>repreef to her entent, and wordis of disclaunder, seying þus:
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="275"/> 'Þou art a Samaritan and hast a feend.' Ful mekely he answerid
<LB/>to boþe, graunting þe ton to true vnderstonding, and denyed þe
<LB/>toþer by expressid wordis.</P>
<P>He grauntid þat he wes a Samaritan in þat þat he wes stille
<LB/>and denyed it not. Not to her entent (þat he wes of Samarie and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="280"/> contrarie to her lawe), but for he wes goostle þat Samaritan þat
<LB/>þe gospel of Luke spekiþ of in X chapitre [33-5], whiche helde
<LB/>in oyle and wyne into þe woundis of þe man þat came doun
<LB/>from Jerusalem into Jerico. Samaritan is as myche for to seie as
<LB/>'a keper', and þerfore Crist most nede graunt þat he is a keper,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="285"/> for he is keper of al mankynde.</P>
<P>He is oure keper in oure moder wombe. He is oure keper in
<LB/>oure birþe. He is oure keper in oure tender age, tofore we
<LB/>kunnen in ony maner help oureself. He is afterwarde oure
<LB/>keper <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="108r"/> in oure age fro oure enemyes, and prinspaly fro oure
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="290"/> goostly enemyes, þat þei haue not so myche power vpon vs as
<LB/>her wille were. Into þis eend he haþe ordeyned euery man an
<LB/>aungel to be his leuetenaunt in þis goostly keping, as Crisostom
<LB/>seiþ in his Omelie.</P>
<P>He wole also be oure keper at þe last houre of oure lijf, if we
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="295"/> serue him truly and trist to him feiþfully when we han moste
<LB/>nede to him, for þen we shullen be most weyke and oure
<LB/>enemyes most strong and moste bisi, for he wote wel if he may
<LB/>not gete vs þen al his traueile is in veyne. And þus God is alwey
<LB/>oure keper, boþe of body and soule, of al maner of yuel. And
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="300"/> þerfore to þis entent þe prophete Dauid seiþe: Dominus
<LB/>custodit te ab omni malo; custodiat animam tuam Dominus. Þat is: 'God,
<LB/>þe Lorde, kepiþ þee fro al yuel as anentis þi body, and kepe he
<LB/>þi soule fro alle goostly perelis.' And also he seiþ of þis keper
<LB/>þus: Dominus custodiat introitum tuum et exitum tuum, ex hoc
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="305"/> nunc et usque in seculum. Þat is: 'Þe Lorde kepe þi entre and þi
<LB/>going out, from now to wiþout eend.'</P>
<P>After þis stille graunting þat he wes a Samaritan, he denyed
<LB/>expressely to þe toþer ful myldely neþeles, seying: 'I haue no
<LB/>feend'. For þis wes impossible, þat þei two þat ben so direct
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="310"/> con[t]rarious in her werkis shulden acorde togider, for Seint
<LB/>Poule seiþe: Que conuentio Christi ad Belial? Que societas luc[i]
<LB/>ad tenebras? þat is: 'What acorde is of Crist to Belial? What
<LB/>acorde is bitwene liȝt and derkenes?' -- a[s] who seiþe 'none'.
<LB/>Lo! in þis meke answere of oure Lorde Jesus Crist we awȝt to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="315"/> be ashamed of oure [wraþe], þat when we ben a litel sterid to
<LB/>ȝyue hem aȝeyn a wel worse worde þen we receyued of hem,
<LB/>and afterwarde do to hem þe yuel þat we may, taking no hede
<LB/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="108v"/> of oure blessid Lorde þat took so greet wrong, wraþid him not
<LB/>þerwiþ, ne ȝaue no wickid worde aȝein. For þouȝ he wolde haue
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="320"/> answerid to þe same persones þat seiden to him þese wordis:
<LB/>'Ȝee han feendis' or 'þe deuel is wiþin ȝow' (for wel he myȝt
<LB/>haue seide þus, for but if þei hadden be fulfillid wiþ þe feend
<LB/>þei myȝt not so shrewidly haue seide by þat Lorde), but he
<LB/>wolde not after þis wrong þat he toke sey þe truþe þat he myȝt,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="325"/> lest men myȝt haue supposid þat he had do so more to venge
<LB/>his iniurie þen for þe loue of truþe. In whiche dede of Crist
<LB/>is vnderstonden þat in þat tyme þat we taken dispitis falsly of
<LB/>oure neiȝboris, we holde oure pees of yuelis whiche we knowen
<LB/>of hem, an aunter lest þat þat shulde be medicyn of iust
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="330"/> correccion we turne into armure of oure owne wickidnes.</P>
<P>Here also men may lerne þat if þe enemyes of God and of his
<LB/>lawe put vpon true prechouris of þe euangelie dyuerse reprouable
<LB/>þingis, of whiche summe ben true to a good vnderstonding
<LB/>and summe ben false and vnworshiping to God, þei may holde
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="335"/> her pees to þe first but alwey denyȝe þe secound. As if a man
<LB/>seide to suche on: 'Þou arte false, and þi teching, boþe!' He
<LB/>may wel graunt þe first by a priue stilnes, or ellis expresly if
<LB/>him like, for Dauid seiþe in þe P[sauter]: Omnis homo mendax.
<LB/>Þat is: 'Euery man is a lyer', for euery man crokiþ fro þe first
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="340"/> truþe, whiche is a preued patron þat alle we shulden sue. But
<LB/>þat þe euangelie is false whiche þat he techiþ, euer he shulde
<LB/>deny, for þat is a blasphemye in God.</P>
<P>But after þat Crist had þus mekely answerid as it is seide
<LB/>bifore, he mekely declarid his answere by þe <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="109r"/> wordis þat suen,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="345"/> seying: 'I honoure or worship my Fader.' For Crist, in alle his
<LB/>myraclis worching, he preferrid þe honoure of God tofore þe
<LB/>honour of his manhod, whiche is not possible of ony deceyuer
<LB/>þat worchiþ by þe feend. But þe Jewes vnhonoureden Crist
<LB/>when þei put vpon hym þat in Belȝebub, prince of feendis, he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="350"/> þrew feendis out of wood men, as þouȝ þe feend and he haden
<LB/>ben sworne breþeren. Ne þei myȝt not sey þat for veynglorie he
<LB/>did suche þingis, for þei þat sechen worshipis of þe worlde,
<LB/>examine þei þe werkis of Crist and deme þei if þei sow[n]en
<LB/>into þe worship of þe worlde as þe Jewes seiden. Or ellis it may
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="355"/> be expouned þus: þat Crist for þis tyme sechiþ not his owne
<LB/>glorie, but God þe Fader sechiþ his worship after his passion,
<LB/>and demeþ synners in him, punysshing hem.</P>
<P>I seide also þat þe þrid parte of þe gospel techiþ vs þat
<LB/>malicious hertis and froward willis ben not correctid neiþer wiþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="360"/> meke excusasion, true declaracion, ne charitable doctryne, but
<LB/>raþer contynuen and encresen in her malice, falsly reporting þe
<LB/>wordis of her techers, pynching at her wordis, and put[ting] on
<LB/>hem lesyngis.</P>
<P>In þis maner þe Jewes diden to oure Lord Jesus Crist. For
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="365"/> after þat he had mekely excusid him þat he had no feend and
<LB/>cleerly declarid it, as it is seide tofore, ȝit ferþermore after þat
<LB/>he ȝaue hem charitable doctrine, wilnyng ful hiȝly þe pro[f]ite
<LB/>of her soulis, and seide in þis wise as þe gospel telliþ: 'For soþe,
<LB/>I sey to ȝou, whoso kepiþ my worde <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="109v"/> shal not taste deeþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="370"/> wiþouten eend.' And not wiþstonding al þis excusacion, declaracion,
<LB/>and charitable doctrine, þei werne not correctid
<LB/>þerby, but raþer continued and encresid in her malice, seying
<LB/>þus: 'Now we knowen wel þat þou hast a feend;' and after þat
<LB/>falsely reporting his wordis menyng of 'bodile deeþ' þere Crist
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="375"/> mente of 'deeþ wiþout eend;' and pynchid at his wordis also ful
<LB/>frowardly, þat he souȝt veynglorie by menyng of his wordis, for
<LB/>he made him more þen Abraham, her fader, whiche wes deed
<LB/>and ȝit he kept ful wel þe worde of God; and after þat þei
<LB/>puttiden lesyngis in his wordis in þat þat he seide of Abraham,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="380"/> her fader: 'Forsoþe, I sey to ȝou, tofore þat Abraham shulde be
<LB/>made, I am', siþen Abraham wes deed long or he wes borne,
<LB/>not taking hede of þe euerlastyngnes of his godheed of whiche
<LB/>Crist spake whiche receyuiþ no chaunging of kynde, ne passing
<LB/>of tyme.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="385"/> And here men moun touche hou þat wyckid men of froward
<LB/>hert ben not amendid but raþer more apeired wiþ preching of
<LB/>þe worde of God.</P>
<P>For þe doctor Crisostom seiþe: 'Riȝt as a piler in an hous, if
<LB/>it stonde vpriȝt after þat it takiþ birþen vpon it, þe more it is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="390"/> made stedfast; and if it be a litel crokid and taken birþen vpon
<LB/>it, it is not þerby made stedfast, but raþer it goþe asyde. Riȝt
<LB/>so, mannus hert, if it be riȝt and it here þe worde of God or
<LB/>ensaumple of a good man, is more conformed to good lijf; [but
<LB/>if it be crokid and it se or here ensaumple of a good man,] not
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="395"/> oonly he is [not] conformed, but more stirid to enuy and more

<P>'Also, þe sunne <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="110r"/> shynyng on dyuerse materis, dyuersly
<LB/>worchiþ; as, if it shyne vpon wexe and vpon cley, þe wexe it
<LB/>meltiþ, þe cley it hardiþ, and þis is not longe vpon þe sunne,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="400"/> but vpon þe dyuerse disposicion of þe materis vpon whom it
<LB/>worchiþ. Riȝt so, worchiþ þe worde of God vpon good and
<LB/>yuel.'</P>
<P>And in þis maner, as þe eend of þe gospel telliþ, when þe
<LB/>Jewes sawen þat þei myȝten not wiþ no colourable wordis bring
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="405"/> aboute her malicious purpos, þen þei weren not ashamed to

<LB/>stonid hym as a blasfemer. And here men may se þat wraþe
<LB/>and enuy moun not worche riȝtwisly. Þerfore seiþe Seint Jame:
<LB/>Ira viri iustitiam Dei non operatur. Þat is: 'Þe wraþe of man
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="410"/> worchiþ not þe riȝtwisnes of God.' For riȝtwisnes of lawe in
<LB/>demyng of blasfemye asken first accusing tofore þe iuge,

<LB/>shulde be stonyd wiþout þe cite, as it is writen in Leuit[icus]
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="415"/> 24.[23]; but þei wolden haue stonid him wiþinne þe temple,
<LB/>whiche wes in al maner vnleful. For as þe story telliþ, in þe

<LB/>Quene to be drawen out of þe boundis of þe temple tofore þat
<LB/>she shulde be slayne, but þe cursid enuy of þe Jewis myȝten not
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="420"/> abyde al þis proces of lawe.</P>
<P>When Jesus saw þe malice of hem, he hid hymself and wente
<LB/>out of þe temple. Þis Crist did for two causis. Oon wes for his
<LB/>tyme wes not comen for to suffre passion, whiche he knew by

<P>The first last þing is mannys bodily deeþ, for þat is þe last

<LB/>last þing, þat is: oure deeþe, we shulden euer haue in mynde,
<LB/>and specialy for þre causis: þe first cause is for it is vncerteyne;
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="170"/> þe secounde for it is peynful; þe þrid for it is dredful.</P>
<P>First, for it is vncerteyne, as Seint Bernarde seiþe: Nichil

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="175"/> If it were so þat a man had a precious juel which, if it were

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="200"/> Illud autem scitote, quoniam si sciret, etc. Þat is: 'Wakiþ,' seiþ Crist --
<LB/>þat is: alwey beeþ in vertuous lijf, oute of dedly synne,

<P>But alas! it semyþ by her dedis þat þere ben many men in þis

<P>Þese ben like to fisshis whiche, as clerkis þat treten of kyndis

<LB/>him and counsel him to leue his synne, he seiþe he hopiþ to
<LB/>haue repentaunce at his eend, and he shal be saue. But ofte it
<LB/>fariþ by hem as þe Wise Man seiþe: Sicut pisces capiuntur hamo,
<LB/>et sicut aues capiuntur laqueo, sic capiuntur homines in tempore
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="235"/> malo. Þat is: 'Riȝt as fisshes ben taken wiþ þe hoke, and briddis

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="240"/> is: 'Þei leden in lustis and in likingis her dayes, and in a poynte

<P>And þus, as I haue shewid, vncerteynte of deeþ is þe first

<P>Þe secounde cause I seide is for deeþ is so peynful. And þat

<LB/>þen shal oure deeþ be þat dyen aȝene oure wille and also for

<P>Þat deeþ also is peyneful is preued by autorite of Seynt
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="270"/> Austyn, þere he seiþe þus: 'Deeþ is so yuel and so greuous þat
<LB/>þe peyne may not be tolde ne be fled by ony reson.' þerfore þe
<LB/>Wise Man, seing deeþ so peynful, seide þus: O mors, quam
<LB/>amara est memoria tua. Þat is: 'O deeþ, how bittur is þe mynde
<LB/>of þe.' It is bittur to him þat heriþ it, and more bittur to hym
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="275"/> þat seeþ it, but moste bittur to hym <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="7r"/> þat feliþ it. For þowȝ an

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="280"/> myche more peynful is it to him if he go into þe house þere þe

<LB/>many oþer signes þat he makiþ tofore his deeþ. But ȝit it is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="285"/> most peynful to hym þat it feliþ, and þat may wel be schewid
<LB/>by reson, me þinkiþ:</P>
<P>If it myȝt be so þat a tre whiche haþe many rotis were

<P>Þe þrid cause is, as I seide, for deeþ is so dredful. And þat
<LB/>for þre <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="7v"/> causis prinsepaly: þe first is for þe dredful siȝt of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="300"/> fendis, whiche euery man shal se in þat houre; þe secounde is
<LB/>for þe grete batayle þat shal be bytwene man and þe fende in
<LB/>þat houre; þe þrid is for no man wote in certeyne where he shal
<LB/>bycome aftre þat houre.</P>
<P>The first is, [as I seide], for þe dredful siȝt of fendis þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="305"/> shullen apere to a man in þat houre. Þat þei shullen so apere
<LB/>semiþ wel, for in þe lijf of Seynt Martyn it is writen how þe
<LB/>fende aperid to þat holy seynt at his dying, whiche hooly
<LB/>chirche clepiþ gemma sacerdotum -- þat is: þe precious ston of all

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="310"/> lower men! Also, as summe doctouris seyne, he aperid at þe
<LB/>passion of Crist vpon þe crosse, to aspie if he myȝt ony þing
<LB/>cacche holde in hym of synne. And þis wolde seme soþe by þe
<LB/>wordis of oure Lorde Jesus Crist, þere he seiþe þus: Venit enim
<LB/>princeps mundi huius, etc, 'Forsoþe, þe prince of þe worlde is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="315"/> comen, and in me he haþe no þing' -- þat is, of synne.</P>
<P>Þis apering of þe fend at þat tyme shal be to man ful dredful,
<LB/>for þer is a doctour þat seiþe: Sola visio demonum exsuperat
<LB/>omne genus tormentorum. Þat is: 'Oonly þe siȝt of fendis
<LB/>ouerpassiþ al kynde of tormentis.' þerfore Dauid þe prophete,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="320"/> seing in spirit tofore þis grete drede þat he shulde haue in þat
<LB/>siȝt, preying to þe Fader of heuen, seide þese wordis: A timore
<LB/>inimici eripe animam meam. Þat is: not only fro þe power, but
<LB/>'fro þe drede of þe enemy, Lorde delyuer <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="8r"/> my soule.' And þus
<LB/>þe dredful siȝt of fendis þat man shal haue in þe houre of his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="325"/> deeþ is þe first cause whi deeþ is to drede.</P>
<P>Þe secound cause [is as] I seyde: for þe grete batayle þat
<LB/>shal be bitwix man and þe feende in þat houre.</P>
<P>If it were so þat þere were set a day of batel wiþinne þe listis

<LB/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS M)" N="56r"/> knowen vnto [God, in whiche] we shullen fiȝt wiþ þe s[otel

<LB/>wote wel if he lose him þen, he shal neuer aftur recouer hym.
<LB/>And in þat batayle he haþe ouercomen many a man hertofore;
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="350"/> and whoso haþe grace to ouercome hym, he shal be crowned in
<LB/>heuen wiþ þe crowne of lijf; and if he be ouercomen wiþ þe
<LB/>feend, he shal be þrowen into helle, þere to wone foreuer.</P>
<P>Þen siþen þis batayle is so perilous, and þe day also
<LB/>vnknowen, it were good [we] had it in mynde euer an aunter
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="355"/> when it comyþ, and arme vs ful surely for þis myȝty enemy,
<LB/>and aspie and lerne his sotelteis by whiche he worchiþ moste.
<LB/>The sikerist armour þat we may haue is of suche a knyȝt þat
<LB/>haþ fouȝten wiþ him in his batayle, whiche armour wes so sure
<LB/>þat he myȝt nowhere hirt him. Þis worshipful knyȝt is oure
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="360"/> Lorde Jesus Crist, boþe God and man, of whose armour spekiþ
<LB/>þe apostle Poule, þere he seiþe þus: Induite vos armatura Dei,
<LB/>etc. (Eph. 6.[11]). Þat is: 'Cloþe ȝou wiþ þe armour of God.'</P>
<P>The first parcel of þis armour is for to girde þe leendis in
<LB/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS M)" N="56v"/> truþe -- [þat is, to restr]eyne wiþ abstinense, as wiþ a [girdel,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="365"/> alle þe bodily] lymes wiþouteforþe [and alle þe power of þe]
<LB/>soule wiþinneforþe [from alle maner of vicis]. Þe secound is þe
<LB/>habur[ioun of riȝtwisnes -- þat] is, to ȝyue to euery creatu[re þat
<LB/>þat longiþ to him]. First to God, worship, <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="9r"/> loue, and drede; to
<LB/>þi souereynis, boþe spiritual and temporal, subieccion and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="370"/> obediens; to þin owne soule, holynes and keping of þe
<LB/>comaundementis of God; to þi breþer[en], boþe frendis and
<LB/>enemyes, loue and charite; to þi sogettis, teching and chastising;
<LB/>to þi pore breþeren, releuyng wiþ þi goodis. Þe þrid is þat
<LB/>alle þe affeccions of þi soule (þat is: þi goostly fete) be set
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="375"/> prinsepaly to preche truly þe gospel of Crist, if þou
<LB/>be a prest, and if þou be none, þat þi loue be set to rule prinsepaly þi lijf
<LB/>aftur þe holy gospel. Þe fourþe is þat þou take þe sheelde of
<LB/>true byleue, of whiche þre corneris shulde be peyntid wiþ þe
<LB/>Fader and Sone and þe Holy Gooste, and wiþinne alle oþer
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="380"/> articlis of byleue, and fast enerued wiþ senous of charite. Þe
<LB/>fifte is þe helme or basnet of hope -- þat is, þat a man, þorow þe
<LB/>mercy of God and þorow his owne meritis, haue tristi hope to
<LB/>be saued. Þe sixte is þe swerde of þe worde of God, of whiche
<LB/>þe feend is sore aferde, for wiþ þat he wes ouercomen in alle his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="385"/> þre batels þat he toke aȝeyn oure Lord Jesus Crist. Þerfore take
<LB/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS M)" N="57r"/> [it] in þi honde and suffur him [neuer] come w[iþinne þe]
<LB/>poynte, for al his des[ire wole be for to come wiþ]inne þis

<LB/>sy[mple soule to misvnder]stonde þe worde of G[od, and so to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="390"/> bringe him in]to dispeyre, and þen he h[aþ þe victorie.</P>
<P>Þe] <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="9v"/> first argument þat he wil make is þis: 'þou hast done
<LB/>many grete and orible synnis wiþouten noumbre, fro þe tyme
<LB/>þat þou kouþist synne into þis day, and now þou hast no space
<LB/>to do satisfaccion for hem alle. For þis is þe last houre, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="395"/> God is riȝtwis and wole not þat ony synne be vnponyshid;
<LB/>wherfore by Goddis riȝtwisnes þou most nedis be dampnid!'</P>
<P>Here be war of þis sotil feend, and suffur him nouȝt wiþ þis
<LB/>sleiȝt to come wiþinne þi swerdis poynte. Strecche oute þi
<LB/>swerde in þis maner, and put it boldely into his face: 'Cursid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="400"/> fend! I bileue fully þat God is riȝtwis, as þou seist. But his
<LB/>mercy passiþ hye aboue, and he seiþe by his prophete þat he
<LB/>wil not þe deeþ of a synful man, but more þat he be conuertid
<LB/>and lyue. And also he seiþe, in anoþer plase, þat in whateuer
<LB/>houre a synful man repentiþ him and makiþ sorow for his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="405"/> synne, he shal be safe. And þis shewid wel in dede þe merciful
<LB/>Lorde in coumforte of alle synful men, hanging on þe crosse, to
<LB/>þe þefe þat henge bisidis hym, þat in þe last houre of his deeþ,
<LB/>seing his grete sorow þorow meke taking [of h]is peyne, þat

<LB/>And I w]ote wel þat he is curtey[s ȝet þis day, and euer wole] be

<LB/>if I ha[ue sorow.' And þus kepe him a]t þe poynte, and he shal
<LB/>[neuer do þe harm.
<LB/>-415 T]he secound argument þat <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="10r"/> he wole make is þis: 'I wes
<LB/>dampnid, as þou wotis wil, for one synne al oonly; and þou hast
<LB/>done synnis vnnoumbrable as greuous or more greuous þen
<LB/>euer wes þat. Þen if God wolde dampne me, þat did but oonly
<LB/>one [synne], and saue þe, þat hast done so many, he most nedis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="420"/> be vnriȝtwis, whiche he may not be. Wherfore, of Goddis
<LB/>riȝtwisnes þou most nedis be dampnid!'</P>
<P>Ȝit holde hym oute at þe poynte, and answere him in þis
<LB/>wise: 'Cursid feend! Þe synne þat þou didest, þou didest it of þin
<LB/>owne malice, and þe synne þat I did, I did it at þe stiring of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="425"/> Þee, enuyous feend, þat lyist in wayte nyȝt and day vpon me,
<LB/>for grete enuy þat þou hast þat I shulde restore þe place þat þou
<LB/>fel fro; and also at þe stiring of my fleishe, fro whiche I may not

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="430"/> whom I offendid, toke my kynde to saue me, and neuer þi
<LB/>kynde to saue þee. And þus I hope of his mercy to be sauid, for
<LB/>alle my synnis, þereas þou, cursid fende, shalt be dampnid for
<LB/>þat one.'</P>
<P>The þrid reson þat he wil make is þis: 'I wes þe hyist aungel
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="435"/> in heuen, and knew þere þe priu[eteis] of God. And þere I
<LB/>knew tofore who shul[lde be damp]nid [and who shulde be

<LB/>and þat þat is tofore ordeyned of [God may] not be chaungid,
<LB/>wherfore þou mo[st nedis] be dampned!'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="440"/> Ȝit take God to þin helpe and [stonde] stifly in þis batel, and
<LB/>holde hym at þe sw[erdis poynte], <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="10v"/> and þou shalt not feyle to
<LB/>haue þe better. Sey to him in þis maner: 'False feend! þis haþe
<LB/>euer be þi custom, wiþ lesyngis to bigile man; for, as Crist
<LB/>witnesiþ of þe, þou arte a lyer and fader of lesyngis. For wiþ þi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="445"/> lesyngis þou deceyuedist oure auncestouris in paradise, and
<LB/>wiþ þi lesyngis þou woldist haue deceyued oure Lorde Jesus
<LB/>Crist. Þerfore I wonder not, þow wiþ þi lesyngis þou woldist
<LB/>deceyue me. False feend! þere þou lyist, where þou seist þat
<LB/>þou knew in heuen who shulde be dampnyd, and who shulde
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="450"/> be saued; for þou knewist not þere þyn owne dampnacion, and
<LB/>if þou knew not þin owne dampnacion, myche more þou knew
<LB/>not myne. And so, for alle þi cursid lesyngis, I hope to þe
<LB/>mercy of God þat þou shalt neuer bringe me in dispeire, as þou
<LB/>woldist.' And þus, if þou ouercome him in þese þre, þorow
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="455"/> vertu of þe Trinite, he shal turne his backe and fle, and neuer
<LB/>eft tempt þee, and þus þou shalt haue þe glorious victory of þis
<LB/>dredful batel.</P>
<P>And þis perilous batayle whiche man shal haue at his deeþ is
<LB/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS M)" N="58v"/> þe secound cause, as I seide, whi þat deeþ is dredful. [þe þrid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="460"/> cause whi þat deeþ is dredful] is for no man wote in certeyn
<LB/>where he shal bycome after þat he [is] deed.</P>
<P>If it were so þat þou shuldist be exilid ou[te of þe] rewme in

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="465"/> and also if þou [knew no]t after þou were exilid into what londe
<LB/>þou [shuldist] go, wheþer þere as þou shuldist be bilouyd, <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="11r"/> or
<LB/>þere as þou shuldist be hatid, and in þis case þou
<LB/>woldist stonde in grete drede and, but if þou were a verrey fole,
<LB/>euermore ordeyne for þi goyng. In þis same case is euery man
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="470"/> in þis worlde. Alle we shullen be exilid oute of þis worlde in
<LB/>whiche we han ben borne and fed after þe day of oure deeþ,
<LB/>whiche is oonly knowen to God, and þat day is fully sette,
<LB/>whiche we may by no wey passe. And wheþer we shullen to
<LB/>heuen or helle, in whiche we shullen be louid or hatid, it is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="475"/> vnknowen to ony man here, but is reseruid til afturwarde. Þis
<LB/>witnesiþ wel þe Wise Man in his boke, þere he seiþ þus: Sunt
<LB/>iusti atque sapientes, et opera eorum in manu Dei; et tamen nescit,
<LB/>etc. Þat is: 'þer ben riȝtwis and wise men, and her werkis ben in

<LB/>perilously, me þinkiþ we han cause to drede oure deeþ.</P>
<P>Þus þen, for þese þre causis þat I haue shewid ȝow (þat deeþ

<P>The secound last þing whiche I spake of at þe bygynnyng,
<LB/>þat a man shulde haue in mynde, is þe day of þe general
<LB/>iugement of God, whiche shal be at þe last day of þis worlde.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="490"/> Of whiche <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="11v"/> last day spekiþ Crist in þe gospel (Jo.6): Ego

<LB/>resurget in resurreccione in nouissima die. 'I wote wel þat he
<LB/>shal arise in rising in þe last day.'
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="495"/> Þis last day shulde euer be had in mynde, and specialy for
<LB/>þre causis: oon is for þe grete accounte þat shal be made þat
<LB/>day; þe secound is for þe dredful apering of þe iuge, and of

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="500"/> dampned in þat day.</P>
<P>First, I sey, for þe grete acounte þat shal be ȝyuen þat day.
<LB/>And wel may it be seyde 'grete', for þre þingis:</P>
<P>First, for þe lorde is grete þat shal here þese acountis. For
<LB/>as Jon seiþe in þe Apocalipis: Rex regum, etc. Þat is: 'He is kynge
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="505"/> of alle kyngis, and lorde of alle lordis.' He is so grete,
<LB/>as Dauid seiþe, þat 'of his greetnes is none eende.' He is so myȝty þat
<LB/>noþing may aȝeynstonde his wille, as Holy Writ witnessiþ: In
<LB/>ditione tua cuncta sunt posita, etc. Þat is: 'In þi comaundementis
<LB/>alle þingis ben put, and þere is no þing may aȝenstonde þi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="510"/> wille.' He is [so] wise þat no þing may be hid fro hym:
<LB/>Sapientie eius non est numerus. 'Of his wisdom is no noumbur.'
<LB/>He is so riche hym nediþ no þing: Dominus vniuersorum tu es.
<LB/>'Of alle þingis þou arte lorde.' He is so riȝtwis þat no þing at

<P>It shal also be grete for þe grete noumbre of peple þat shal

<P>The secound cause why þat last day shulde be had in mynde
<LB/>is for þe ferful siȝt of hem þat shullen apere in þat day. For as
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="640"/> þe doctor Januensis rehersiþ vpon þe gospellis: þat aboue men

<LB/>Byhinde shal alle þe worlde be set on fire. Bifore, strong

<P>Alas! when þe wrecchid synful man is þus biset on euery

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="655"/> Seint Jon seiþe in þe Apocalips, for ferdfulnes of whos face þei
<LB/>shullen sey to grete hillis and smale: 'Falliþ doune vpon vs, and

<LB/>'The worme of hem shal not dye.' Neiþer he may fle aȝeyne
<LB/>into þe worlde, for þere is fire brennyng, settyng on fire al þat is

<P>The þrid cause why þat þe last dredful day shulde be had in

<LB/>ȝyue þat day to hem þat shullen be dampnyd. For alle þe peynis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="675"/> þat God sendiþ to a man in þis worlde is but as a curtesie and
<LB/>esy chastising, as þe fader chastisiþ his tender childe wiþ a fewe
<LB/>russhis or wiþ a litel ȝerde. Þe peynes of purgatory ben as a
<LB/>staf, wiþ whiche a man betiþ hys son when he comyþ to
<LB/>[grettere] age. But for in þese two chastisingis is [coumfort and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="680"/> hope of] mercy, þerfore seiþ Dauid: '<SUPPLIED>Virga tua</SUPPLIED>, etc. 'Þi
<LB/>ȝerde,' he seiþe, 'and þi staf, þei han coumfortid me.' But þe
<LB/>dredful sentense of God, þe riȝtful <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="15v"/> iuge, in þat day shal be as
<LB/>an yren scourge, as Dauid seiþe: Reges eos in virga ferrea. 'Þou

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="685"/> Þou shalt al toberst hem togider, whiche may neuer be repeyrid
<LB/>aȝeyn.' Of þis scourge, Crist spekiþ hymself in þe gospel of
<LB/>Matheu, where he seiþe þus: Discedite a me, etc. 'Departiþ awey

<LB/>seiþe þus: Descenderunt ad fundamenta laci qui cadauer putridum.
<LB/>Þat is; 'Þei han descendit to þe fundamentis of þe lake as
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="905"/> rotid cariouns.' And for þe secound, seiþe þus: Erit pro suaui
<LB/>odore fetor. Þat is: 'Þere shal be for swete sauoure stynke.'</P>
<P>Þe seuent peyne of þis prison shal be drede and quaking
<LB/>whiche shal be þere, boþe for þe [ferdful] siȝt and þe hydous
<LB/>noyse of feendis, and drede of her dyuerse peynis in þo
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="910"/> derkenessis, and horroure or hydousnes, of whiche spekiþ
<LB/>Dauid in þe Sauter, seying: Timor et tremor venerunt super me,
<LB/>etc. Þat is: 'Drede and quakyng ben comen vpon me, and
<LB/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="20v"/> derkenessis han hiled me togider.' Of whiche hydousnes
<LB/>spekiþ Job in his boke, þere he seiþe þus: Vbi vmbra mortis, etc.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="915"/> Þat is: 'Where is shadow of deþe and non ordur, but euerlasting
<LB/>horroure and hydousnes dwelliþ þerinne.'</P>
<P>Þe eiȝt peyne of þat prisoun shal be discorde and discoumforte
<LB/>of felouship, for þere shal be none oþer felouship but
<LB/>feendis and dampned men. Of feendis shul þei no coumfort
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="920"/> haue, for þei shullen be bisy and [glad] euerlastingly to turment
<LB/>hem; ne none of hem shal haue coumfort of oþer, for þe fader
<LB/>shal hate þe sone, and þe sone þe fader, and wary and curse
<LB/>yche oþer. And þerfore seiþe Jeremye þe prophete: Non est
<LB/>consoletur eam ex omnibus caris eius. 'Þere is none þat shal
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="925"/> coumfort oþer of alle hir dere derlingis.' But riȝt as in heuen þe
<LB/>mo þer comen þider, þe more is þe blis encresid of hem þat ben

<P>Þe nynþe peyne of þis prisoun is [þe] grettist of alle: þat is,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="930"/> wanting of þe siȝt of God in blisse. For riȝt as in heuen þe most
<LB/>ioy þat seyntis and aungels haue is þe glorious siȝt of God in his
<LB/>trone, riȝt so þe most peyne þat dampnyd men shullen haue in
<LB/>helle shal be wanting of þat siȝt. For, as doctouris seyne, if it
<LB/>myȝt be possible þat men in þe peyne[s] of helle myȝten see þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="935"/> siȝt of <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="21r"/> God in his blisse, alle þe peynys in helle shulden not
<LB/>greue hem for [joy of þat siȝt]. And seyntis hadden leuer to
<LB/>chese, if it were possible to be put in her choyse, raþer to be in
<LB/>helle peynys and haue þat siȝt, þen in þe ioyes of heuen and
<LB/>wante þat siȝt. Of þe wanting of þat siȝt to dampned men
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="940"/> spekiþ þe prophete Ysay (26.[10]), þere he seiþe þus: In terra
<LB/>sanctorum iniqua gessit, etc. Þat is: 'In þe londe of hooly men he
<LB/>haþe wrouȝt wickid þingis, and he shal not se þe glory of þe
<LB/>Lorde.' And, in anoþer place: Tollatur impius ne videat gloria
<LB/>Dei. Þat is: 'Be þe wickid man taken away, þat he se not þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="945"/> glorye of God.'</P>
<P>Þe last peyne of þis prisoun is dispeire of remedy, for alle þe
<LB/>freris preyers of þe foure ordris, ne letters of fraternite, ne þe
<LB/>Popis pardoun, may no man bye oute of þat woful plase. Þat
<LB/>preueþ Job, þere he seiþe þus: In inferno nulla est redempcio, etc.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="950"/> Þat is: 'In helle is noon aȝeynbying.' And Jeremy þe prophete
<LB/>seiþe also in þis maner: Quare factus est dolor meus perpetuus, et
<LB/>plaga mea desperabilis? Þat is: '"Why," seiþe þe dampnyd man,
<LB/>"is my sorow eendles, and my wounde dispeyrable for to be
<LB/>helid?"' Also, it may be preued by reson þat þere is dispeyre of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="955"/> remedy. For if þere were ony hope of remedy, þen were þere
<LB/>ioy, for euery hope is a maner of ioy; and þat is impossible, for

<P>Þe fourþe last þing þat I spake of in þe bygynnyng, and

<LB/>þat shal be þe last rewarde to hem þat lyueden in <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="22r"/> þis worlde

<P>Þat þis joy also shal be þe last rewarde to Goddis true

<P>First, in þe delitable siȝt and beyng of þat feire and mery
<LB/>cite þat men shullen be in heuen. Þe secound is in þe ioy þat þei
<LB/>shullen haue in hemsilf, boþe in body and in soule. Þe þrid is in
<LB/>[þe] blessid and worshipful cumpany þat þei shullen haue þere.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1000"/> Þe fourþe is in þe glorious siȝt of God, boþe of his godhed and
<LB/>of his manhed, whiche þei shullen haue þere.</P>
<P>First, I sey, in þe <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="22v"/> delitable siȝt and being of þat feyre and
<LB/>mery cite of heuen. Of þat cite spekiþ Seynt Austyn and seyþe:
<LB/>Vera pax ibi erit, nihil aduersitas nec a seipso nec ab alio pacietur.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1005"/> Þat is: 'Verrey pees shal be þere, where neyþer man shal suffre
<LB/>aduersite oþer of himself or of ony oþer.' Byholde we þen þe
<LB/>worþines of þat blessid cite in as myche as it is possible vs to
<LB/>biholde, for to comprehende it in mannys wit verily as it is, no
<LB/>wit of man sufficiþ þerto.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1010"/> What may be blessider þen þis cite, where shal be no drede
<LB/>of pouerte, ne of sikenes, ne no feblenes, ne drede of þe deuel,
<LB/>ne none aspies of feendis, ne no drede of helle? þere shal neiþer
<LB/>deeþ be of body, ne of soule, but vndeedlynes, euerlasting pees,
<LB/>and continuel gladnes. Þere shal be real shynyng of liȝt; not þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1015"/> þat is now, but so myche clerer hou myche it is blessider. For
<LB/>þat cite, as Seynt Jon seiþe in þe Apocalipse, shal not nede þe
<LB/>liȝt of þe sunne, but almyȝty God shal liȝten it, and his
<LB/>launterne is þe lombe.</P>
<P>Þere shal be no nyȝt, ne derkenessis, ne rennyng togidre of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1020"/> cloudis, no sharpnes of colde, or brennyng hete; but suche

<P>Þere shal be no age, ne mysese of age, whil al men shullen

<P>Þe excellence and worþines of þe goodis of þe cite ouerpassen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1030"/> alle þe goodis of þis worlde, specialy in fyue þingis:</P>
<P>First, in gretnes, for Seynt Petur seyþe: Credentes exultabitis,
<LB/>etc. Þat is: 'Ȝe þat bileuen, ȝe shullen ioy wiþ gladnes þat may
<LB/>not be tolde.' And Dauid seiþe: 'How grete is þe multitude of

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1035"/> þee.'</P>
<P>Þe secound, þei ben many, for Seynt Poule seiþe: Oculus non
<LB/>vidit, etc. 'Yȝe haþe not seen, neiþer ere herde, neiþer stiȝed
<LB/>into mannys herte, whiche þou hast arayed to hem þat louen
<LB/>þe.' Also, Seynt Austin seiþe: Cogita quicquid vis, et quicquid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1040"/> potes, omnem cogitacionem excedit omne desiderium, superat illa
<LB/>felicitas. Þat is: 'Þenke whateuer þou wil, and whateuer þou
<LB/>maiste, and þat blessidnes [ouerpasseþ] al þouȝt, and ouercomeþ
<LB/>al desire.'</P>
<P>Þe þrid, þei ben euerlasting, for Ysay seiþ: Leticia sempiterna

<LB/>hem.'</P>
<P>Þe fourþe, þei shullen be restful, of whiche spekiþ Seynt
<LB/>Poule, seying in þis wise: Pax Dei, que exsuperat omnem sensum.
<LB/>Þat is, 'Þe pees <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="23v"/> of God, þat ouerpassiþ alle mannys [wit], kepe

<P>Þe fifþe, þei shullen be siker, for of hem may be seide þese
<LB/>wordis of Holy Scripture whiche God seide to his peple of
<LB/>Israel by þe londe of biheest, whiche wes figure of þe blis of

<LB/>beestis fro ȝou, and swerde shal not passe by ȝoure cuntreis.'</P>
<P>Of þis cite seiþe Seint Bernarde: O ciuitas celestis, mansio

<LB/>cite of God.' Towarde þis cite we owȝten to hyȝe vs fast, for of
<LB/>þis worshipful cite we ben not straungers and comelingis, but

<P>The secound þing þat þis joy prinsepaly stondiþ inne is in
<LB/>ioy þat men shullen haue in hemsilf, boþe in body and eke [in]
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1070"/> soule.</P>
<P>First, men shullen be endowid in her bodies wiþ foure maner
<LB/>of ioyes: þat is, wiþ clerte, agilite, sotilte, and
<LB/>immortalite.</P>
<P>First wiþ <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="24r"/> clerte, for þen mennys bodies shullen shyne as
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1075"/> clere as þe sunne, as Crist witnessiþ: Fulgebunt iusti sicut sol,
<LB/>etc. And þe sunne þen shal be seuen syþis briȝter þen it is now,
<LB/>as þe prophete witnessiþ. Þen mennys bodyes shullen be seuen
<LB/>siþis briȝter þen is þe sunne now.</P>
<P>Þe secound is agilite, þat is: swifnes. Þat is, as Seynt Austyn
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1080"/> seiþe: 'Wheresoeuer þe soule wole, anon þer shal be þe body.'
<LB/>Of þis dowery spekiþ þe Wise Man in þe Boke of Wisdom and
<LB/>seiþe: Tanquam scintille in arundineto, etc. Þat is: 'Þei shul run
<LB/>whider þei wil, as swiftly as sperkis in a redy plase.'</P>
<P>Þe þrid is sotilte. Þat is, mennys bodies shul be so sotil þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1085"/> þei mai perse whatso þei wil, and no þing shal let hem to go
<LB/>where þei wil.</P>
<P>Þe fourþe is immortalite, þat is: vndeedlynes, þat þei mowe
<LB/>neuer aftur dye no more, of whiche spekiþ Jon in þe Apocalipse
<LB/>and seyþe: Mors vltra non erit. Þat is: 'Deeþ shal be no more to

<P>Þe joy þat men shullen haue in her soulis in þat place shal
<LB/>stonde in þre þingis: þat is, clere biholding, loue, and euerlasting

<P>First in clere byholding, for þere as 'we seen him nowe as it

<LB/>riȝt as he is, as witnessiþ Seynt Poule to þe Corinthyes.</P>
<P>Þe secound dowery or ioy of þe soule is loue, for þen
<LB/>mannys loue shal be so clere þat it shal <MILESTONE UNIT="folio (MS R)" N="24v"/> be sette in God oonly,
<LB/>whiche is best good, wiþouten ony contrarious affeccion.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1100"/> Þe þrid is siker welding euerlastingly of þat ioy of whiche

<P>Þe þrid þing þis ioy prinsepaly stondiþ inne is in þe
<LB/>worshipful, blessid, and coumfortable cumpany þat shal be in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1105"/> þat place. Þat is, first, of þe feloushipe, myrþe, and melody of

<P>Þe wille of oon is þe wille of anoþer. Þe mo þat þei ben, þe

<P>Þe fourþe good þing in whiche prinsepaly þat blisse shal

<P>Þis boke shal neuer be claspid vp, ne closid in no cloyster,

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1160"/> Now blessid is þat blessid place and alle þe peple þerein, and

<P>Lorde, for þe blode þat þou bleddist to bye man wiþ so dere,
