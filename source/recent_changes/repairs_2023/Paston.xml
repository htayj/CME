And that also the title of the seid Paston to the seid maner is  not all only by the seid feffement, but aswell by a graunt and bargeyn  mad a-thwyx the seid Fastolff and the seid Paston as by the last will of  the seid Fastolff, whereby the seid Paston ought to take the hole profitez  of the seid maner.

And if my seruauntes faile I had lever wage some  other man for a iorny or a season thanne my mater shuld be on-sped.

And yet therof telle Richard Calle he sent me  viij nobills in goold for v mark and þat as longe as gold was bettir  payment thanne siluer I had neuir so moch gold of hym at onys; and telle  hym þat I woll nat þat he shall kepe þat vse, for I  trowe my tenauntes haue but litell gold to pay.

And I wote well that the payment of my prestes and other  charges þat I haue for Fastolffes livelode is not so gret as the  livelode is, thow part therof be in trobill. And thanne consider that I had  nought of my livelode for myn exspenses at London this thwolmonyth  day.

As for þe seyd John Heylisdon, he  was a por man born, and from hym þe seyd maner dessendid to  Alise his dowtyr, hos estat I haue; and I suppose þe seyd Dewk  comyth not of hem.  <LB/>Item, as for the pedegré of þe  seyd Dewk, he is sone to William Pool, Dewk of Suffolk, sone to  Mychell Pool, Erl of Suffolk, sone to Mychel Pool, þe furst Erl of  Suffolk of þe Polis, mad be King Richard seth my fader was born.  And þe seyd furst Mychell was sone to on William Pool of Hull,  whech was a wurchepfull man grow be fortwne of þe werld, and  he was furst a marchant and after a knygth, and after he was mad  baneret. And if any of þees hadde þe maner of Drayton I  woll los c li., so þat any persone for þe Dewk will be bond  in as mech to proue þe contrary. And I wot weel þe seyd  Dewkis cowncell wil not claym þe seyd maner be þe tytill  of þe fader of þe seyd William Pool.

And I told hym that, as for such mony that shuld come from  hym for that lond, I wold take it of hym and ley it vp by the self, that I  myght purchase other lond therwith, bicause I wold lesse Fastolffes  lyuelode for the college; but I wold pay hym his dewté without  any stoppage.

And as for my lord Chaunceler,  he was departed fro London and was redyn to þe Kyng ij dayes or  we were come to London; and as we vnderstand he hasted hym to  þe Kyng by-cause of my Lord Ryuers takyng at Sandwyche,  &amp;c. And as for Maister John Stokys, he was at Mortelak, wheder  we yede and spak wyth hym, and fond by hym by the begynnyng that he  had ben labored a-yens you, but by whom we coude not knowyn for he  wold not telle; but he sayd he was spoken to by on whiche he coude not  remembre þat he schuld take good heed vppon the probat of my  maisters wyll how his londys schuld be gyded by-cause there was a  thyng ensealed as his wyll which was forged after my maisters decesse,  &amp;c. But or we had thus moche of his confessyon we were resonably  well jn credens wyth hym; but it was long or we coude fynd hym  feythfully dysposed in oure conceytys. and whan we had hym resonably  after oure entent, we enfourmyd hym of Yeluerton nedeles wastyng of  my maister godys and the mystrust that he had jn hem hom my maister  most erthely trustyd, and how his desyre was synglerly to have had the  kepyng of Castre and all stuffe wyth-jnne it, and there to have lodged  hym-self; and also hou he dede meve my Lady Hevenyngham, &amp;c.  Wherfore he avyseth you, for ony wrytyng or citacion that cometh fro  my lord of Caunterbury or fro hym, that ye your-self kepe the goodys  stylle and lete hym a-lone for the purvyans of all suche wrytyngys or  cytacions. We assked hym that, if Yeluerton wold not be refourmed,  wheder for the dyscharge of all your concyens a mene mygth be found to  a-voyde hym owte of the testament. And he sayd if he be fals to the dede  it is a cause resonable, and per-juré is a-noþer cause; and  if ye woll Maister Stokys com to Norwiche for the probat, &amp;c., he  woll com hym-self or make  
<EPB/><PB N="161"/>a comyssyon to oþer persones as ye woll assigne, or ell as many  as woll take charge wyth you to make a proxi,be it to me or to sum  oþer,and send it hym and ye wyll ther-wyth, and it schall be  proved by that mene. And all the fauour þat may be don for you  schall be don. And to your bargeyn he woll owe and do all the fauour  that he may wyth trouthe, and it schall not nede no wytnesse to youre  bargeyn wyth- oute ther be a contradiccion; and if ther be a  contradiccion iij or iiij wytnesse is j-now. And he hath no conceyte in  Yeluerton as now, and also but lytyll jn Fenyngley for the seruyce that  he oweth to my lord Tresorer, and oþer causes whiche we  expresse not for cause of long wrytyng. And he avysed vs to go speke  wyth my Lord Chaunceler and Lord Beauchamp to wete wheder they  woll take ony charge or not, and to lete hym have knoweletch of ther  dysposycion. And he geveth you leve wyth a-noþer executour, or  wyth youre owyn clerk, to mynystre and geve almesse at his perill.

And euer more whan I sey vn-to hym that it may not be  gaynseyd but as touchyng to al my maister lond jn Norffolk and Suffolk  it is his wyll and suffycyant prove ther-vppon that ye schuld have it,  &amp;c., and than he answereth and prayeth me no more to speke of  that mater for he vnderstand no<UNCLEAR>...</UNCLEAR> covenaunt, &amp;c.; and more can  I not gete of hym. But for God I fele by hym jn my conceyte that he  may help to save and gete a ml marc or to ml marc which wyth-oute his  help may not be saved, as he seyth. And to fele hym wheder he lyed or  seyd soth, I asked hym wheder he wold take that which mygth not be  saved wyth-owte his help for his reward, and he sayd ya, wyth good  wyll; and therfor wey ye all, &amp;c.  <LB/>Item, Ser Phelyp  Wentworth acte is passed the Kyng, whiche I doute not mygth not a be  with-oute my lord Chaunceler good wyll and assent; and William  Worceter sueth to have a copy therof, whiche he mygth have had of me  if he had lyst, &amp;c.  <LB/>Item, ser, I Playter speke wyth Maister  Yeluerton, and he taketh it  
<EPB/><PB N="162"/>gretely to dysplesour that it was noysed that he and William Wayte  schuld have labored to an endyted Maister Th. Howys; for he seyth for  ony anger he wold not do so, and if he mygth wete that W. Wayte  labored it he schuld neuer do hym seruice. And as touchyng to the  provokyng  that my Lady Hevenyngham schuld sewe forth for Castre, he  seyth he neuer thougth it, but the sendyng to my seyd lady was by a man  of his, and <DEL>a</DEL>-noþer of Fenyngley, to wete if sche hard ony  tydyngys fro Coventré, and no oþer maner of langage.  How be it I vnderstand he woll not be straunge to falle jn wyth you  a-geyn, and also that he woll not hurte you jn your bargeyn if ye coude  be frendely dysposed to hym ward as ye have ben; for wyth-oute a  frendelyhood of your parte hym semeth he schuld not gretely help you jn  your bargeyn, so I fele hym. He leueth sum-qwhat a-loffe, and not  vtterly malycyous a-yens you. The cyrcumstans  of oure talkyng were to  long to wryte, and ther-for I expresse the substauns as I conceyve,  &amp;c. As for my lord Fortescu, we comond wyth hym seuerally, and  for to wryte all thyng of oure comonyng it were to long; but jn  conclusyon we vnderstand his good lordschip to you wardys, and all his  fauour wyth trouth, for that is his seyng. I desyred William Jeney to  calle vppon the maters jn lawe for the ward, &amp;c., and he avyseth  me to leve this terme and to take avysement a-yens the nexst terme,  &amp;c., and also I thynk it so best whyll my lord Chaunceler hath take  it jn rewle, &amp;c., to whom we purpose to ryde and comon wyth jn  all maters, &amp;c. As for tydyngys, my Lord Ryuers was brought to  Caleys and by-for the lordys wyth viij xx torches, and there my lord of  Salesbury reheted hym, callyng hym knaves son that he schuld be so  rude to calle hym and these oþer lordys traytours, for they schull  be found the Kyngys treue liege men whan he schuld be found a  traytour, &amp;c. And my lord of Warrewyk reheted hym and seyd that  his fader was but a squyer and broute vp wyth Kyng Herry the vte, and  sethen hym-self made by maryage and also made lord, and that it was  not his parte to have swyche langage of lordys beyng of the Kyngys  blood. And my lord of Marche reheted hym jn lyke wyse, and Ser  Antony was reheted for his langage of all iij lordys jn lyke wyse.  <LB/>Item, the Kyng cometh to London ward, and as it is seyd rereth  the pepyll as he com; but þis is certayn, ther be comyssyons made  jn-to dyuers schyres that euery man be redy jn his best aray to com whan  the Kyng send for hem.  <FOREIGN>plus jn tergo.</FOREIGN><LB/>Item, my Lord Roos is com fro Gynes.

Sir, it was tolde me by rythe a worshipfull  man that loveth you rythe well. and ve him. and ye xall knowe his name  hereafter, but put all things out of doubt he is such a man as will not lye.  On the xjth day of October the Kinge seid, 'We have sent two privy  sealys to Paston by two yeomen of our chamber, and he disobeyeth  þem; but we will send him a-noder tomorrowe, and by Gods  mercye and if he come not then he xall dye for it. We will make all oder  men beware by him how they xall disobey our writinge. A servant of our  hath made a complainte of him. I cannot thinke that he hath informed us  all truely, yet not for that we will not suffer him to disobey our writinge;  but sithen he disobeyeth our writinge we may beleve the better his  gydinge is as we be informed'. And þerwith he made a gret  a-vowe that if ye come not at the third  commandement ye xulde dye  therefore. This man that tolde me this is as well learned a man as any is  in England. And the same xjth day of October he advised me to send a  man to yow in all the hast that might be to lett yow have knowlache, and  that ye xulde not lett for none excuse, but that ye xulde make the man  good cheere and come as hastily ye might to the Kinge, for he  understandeth so much that the Kinge will kepe his promise.  Notwithstanding, by mine advice, if ye have this letter or the messenger  come to you, come to the Kinge wards or ye meete with him, and when  ye come ye must be suer of a great excuse. Also, if ye doe well, come  right stronge, for Howards wife made her bost that if any of her  husbands men might come to yow þer xulde goe noe penny for  your life.; and Howard hath with the Kinge a great felloweship.   
<EPB/><PB N="202"/>
This letter was written the same day that the Kinge said these words, and  the same day that it was told me, and that day was the xjth day of  October as abovesaid; and on the next morning send I forth a man to  yow with this letter, and on the same day send the Kinge the third privye  seale to you. Alsoe he þat tolde me this seid that it were better for  yow to come upp then to be fotte out of your house with streingth, and  to abide the Kings judgement þerin, for he will take your  contumacy to great displeasure. Also, as I understand, the Duke of  Norffolk hath made a great complaint of yow to the Kinge, and my Lord  of Suffolk and Howard and Wyngfelde helpe well to every day and call  upon the Kinge against yow. The Kinge is at this day at Grenewich, and  þer will be still till the Parliament beginne. Some say he will goe  to Walsingham, but Master Sotyll seid in the Aulle in the Temple that he  harde no worde of any such pilgrimage. No more, &amp;c. Written the  xjth day of October at midnight.

<EPB/><PB N="224"/><P>Ryght worshipfull husbond, I recomaund me to yow, and prey yow  to wete þat on Friday last passed be-fore noon, þe parson  of Oxened beyng at messe in our parossh chirche, euyn atte leuacion of  þe sakeryng, Jamys Gloys hadde ben in þe tovne and come  homward by Wymondams gate. And Wymondam stod in his gate and  John Norwode his man stod by hym, and Thomas Hawys his othir man  stod in þe strete by þe canell side. And Jamys Gloys come  with his hatte on his hede betwen bothe his men, as he was wont of  custome to do . And whanne Gloys was a-yenst Wymondham he seid  þus, 'couere thy heed'. And Gloys seid ageyn, 'so i shall for the'.  And whanne Gloys was forther passed by þe space of iij or iiij  strede, Wymondham drew owt his dagger and seid, 'Shalt þow so,  knave?' And þerwith Gloys turned hym and drewe owt his dagger  and defendet hym, fleyng in-to my moderis place; and Wymondham and  his man Hawys kest stonys and dreve Gloys into my moderis place. And  Hawys folwyd into my moderis place and kest a ston as meche as a  forthyng lof into þe halle after Gloys; and þan ran owt of  þe place ageyn. And Gloys folwyd owt and stod with-owt  þe gate, and þanne Wymondham called Gloys thef and seid  he shuld dye, and Gloys seid he lyed and called hym charl, and bad hym  come hym-self or ell þe best man he hadde, and Gloys wold  answere hym on for on. And þanne Haweys ran into  Wymondhams place and feched a spere and a swerd, and toke his  maister his swerd. And with þe noise of þis a-saut and  affray my modir and I come owt of þe chirche from þe  sakeryng; and I bad Gloys go in to my moderis place ageyn, and so he  dede. And thanne Wymondham called my moder and me strong hores,  and seid þe Pastons and alle her kyn were <UNCLEAR>...</UNCLEAR>Myngham <UNCLEAR>...</UNCLEAR>e  seid he lyed, knave and charl as he was. And he had meche large  langage, as ye shall knowe her-after by mowthe. After non my modir   and I yede to þe Priour of Norwich and told hym al þis cas,  and þe Priour sent for Wymondham and þerwhyle we yede  hom a-geyn and Pagraue come with vs hom. And whil Wymondham was  with þe Priour, and we were at hom in our places, Gloys stod in  þe strete at my moderis gate and Hawys aspyed hym þere  as he stod on þe Lady Hastyngis chambre. A-non he come doun  with a tohand swerd and assauted ageyn þe seid Gloys and  Thomas my moderis man, and lete flye a strok at Thomas with þe  sword and rippled his hand with his sword. And as for þe latter  assaut þe parson of Oxened sygh it and wole a-vowe it. And  moche more thyng was do, as Gloys can tell yow by mouthe, And for  þe perilx of þat  
<EPB/><PB N="225"/>myght happe by þese premysses and þe circumstances  þerof to be eschewed, by þ'aduyse of my modir and  oþer I send yow Gloys to attend up-on yow for a seson, for ease  of myn owen hert; for in good feyth I wolde not for xl li. haue suyche  an-oþer trouble. As touchyng my Lady Morlé, she seith  þat she atte hire will wole haue þe benyfyce of hire  obligacion, for hir counseyll telleth hir, as she seith, þat it is  forfayt, And she wole not haue the relif til she hath your homage,  &amp;c.

The  Duck had be betere than a ml li. that it had neuer be don, and ye haue  the more gode wyll of the pepyll that it ys so foyll don.

Th'inhabitauntes a-bought Brest haue layd  siege thereunto, and goten the base courte of the Frenshmen or the  departyng of oure said pursiuaunt.
