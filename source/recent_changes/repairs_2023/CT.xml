<L N="489">By god! in erthe I was his purgatorie, </L>
<L N="490">For which I hope his soule be in glorie. </L>
<L N="491">For, God it woot, he sat ful ofte and song, </L>

<L N="525">My fifthe housbonde, God his soule blesse! </L>
<L N="526">Which that I took for love, and no richesse, </L>
<L N="527">He som tyme was a clerk of oxenford, </L>
<L N="528">And hadde left scole, and wente at hom to bord </L>
<L N="529">With my gossib, dwellynge in oure toun; </L>

<L N="555">Therfore I made my visitaciouns </L>
<L N="556">To vigilies and to processiouns, </L>
<L N="557">To prechyng eek, and to thise pilgrimages, </L>
<L N="558">To pleyes of myracles, and to mariages, </L>

<L N="562">And wostow why? for they were used weel. </L>
<L N="563">Now wol I tellen forth what happed me. </L>
<L N="564">I seye that in the feeldes walked we, </L>
<L N="565">Til trewely we hadde swich daliance, </L>
<L N="566">This clerk and I, that of my purveiance </L>
<L N="567">I spak to hym and seyde hym how that he, </L>

<L N="577">And eek I seyde I mette of hym al nyght, </L>
<L N="578">He wolde han slayn me as I lay upright, </L>
<L N="579">And al my bed was ful of verray blood; </L>
<L N="580">But yet I hope that he shal do me good, </L>
<L N="581">For blood bitokeneth gold, as me was taught. </L>
<L N="582">And al was fals; I dremed of it right naught, </L>
<L N="583">But as I folwed ay my dames loore, </L>

<L N="585">But now, sire, lat me se, what I shal seyn? </L>
<L N="586">A ha! by god, I have my tale ageyn. </L>
<L N="587">Whan that my fourthe housbonde was on beere, </L>
<L N="588">I weep algate, and made sory cheere, </L>
<L N="589">As wyves mooten, for it is usage, </L>
<L N="590">And with my coverchief covered my visage, </L>
<L N="591">But for that I was purveyed of a make, </L>

<L N="593">To chirche was myn housbonde born a-morwe </L>
<L N="594">With neighebores, that for hym maden sorwe; </L>
<L N="595">And jankyn, oure clerk, was oon of tho. </L>
<L N="596">As help me god! whan that I saugh hym go </L>

<L N="599">That al myn herte I yaf unto his hoold. </L>
<L N="600">He was, I trowe, a twenty wynter oold, </L>
<L N="601">And I was fourty, if I shal seye sooth; </L>
<L N="602">But yet I hadde alwey a coltes tooth. </L>
<L N="603">Gat-tothed I was, and that bicam me weel; </L>
<L N="604">I hadde the prente of seinte venus seel. </L>
<L N="605">As help me god! I was a lusty oon, </L>
<L N="606">And faire, and riche, and yong, and wel bigon; </L>
<L N="607">And trewely, as myne housbondes tolde me, </L>
<L N="608">I hadde the beste quoniam myghte be. </L>
<L N="609">For certes, I am al venerien </L>
<L N="610">In feelynge, and myn herte is marcien. </L>
<L N="611">Venus me yaf my lust, my likerousnesse, </L>
<L N="612">And mars yaf me my sturdy hardynesse; </L>

<L N="619">Yet have I martes mark upon my face, </L>
<L N="620">And also in another privee place. </L>
<L N="621">For God so wys be my savacioun, </L>
<L N="622">I ne loved nevere by no discrecioun, </L>
<L N="623">But evere folwede myn appetit, </L>
<L N="624">Al were he short, or long, or blak, or whit; </L>
<L N="625">I took no kep, so that he liked me, </L>
<L N="626">How poore he was, ne eek of what degree. </L>
<L N="627">What sholde I seye? but, at the monthes ende, </L>
<L N="628">This joly clerk, jankyn, that was so hende, </L>
<L N="629">Hath wedded me with greet solempnytee; </L>
<L N="630">And to hym yaf I al the lond and fee </L>

<L N="632">But afterward repented me ful soore; </L>
<L N="633">He nolde suffre nothyng of my list. </L>
<L N="634">By god! he smoot me ones on the lyst, </L>
<L N="635">For that I rente out of his book a leef, </L>
<L N="636">That of the strook myn ere wax al deef. </L>
<L N="637">Stibourn I was as is a leonesse, </L>
<L N="638">And of my tonge verray jangleresse, </L>
<L N="639">And walke I wolde, as I had doon biforn, </L>
<L N="640">From hous to hous, although he had it sworn; </L>
<L N="641">For which he often tymes wolde preche, </L>
<L N="642">And me of olde romayn geestes teche; </L>
<L N="643">How he symplicius gallus lefte his wyf, </L>

<L N="647">Another romayn tolde he me by name, </L>
<L N="648">That, for his wyf was at a someres game </L>
<L N="649">Withouten his wityng, he forsook hire eke. </L>
<L N="650">And thanne wolde he upon his bible seke </L>
<L N="651">That ilke proverbe of ecclesiaste </L>
<L N="652">Where he comandeth, and forbedeth faste, </L>
<L N="653">Man shal nat suffre his wyf go roule aboute. </L>
<L N="654">Thanne wolde he seye right thus, withouten doute: </L>

<L N="660">Of his proverbes n' of his olde sawe, </L>
<L N="661">Ne I wolde nat of hym corrected be. </L>
<L N="662">I hate hym that my vices telleth me, </L>
<L N="663">And so doo mo, God woot, of us than I. </L>
<L N="664">This made hym with me wood al outrely; </L>
<L N="665">I nolde noght forbere hym in no cas. </L>
<L N="666">Now wol I seye yow sooth, by seint thomas, </L>
<L N="667">Why that I rente out of his book a leef, </L>
<L N="668">For which he smoot me so that I was deef. </L>
<L N="669">He hadde a book that gladly, nyght and day, </L>

<L N="671">He cleped it valerie and theofraste, </L>
<L N="672">At which book he lough alwey ful faste. </L>
<L N="673">And eek ther was somtyme a clerk at rome, </L>

<L N="686">He knew of hem mo legendes and lyves </L>

<L N="688">For trusteth wel, it is an impossible </L>
