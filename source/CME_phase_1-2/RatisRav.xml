The fyrſt chepture of this trety begynnys of the commendatioune of dede, Fore ded, as haly wryt ſais is mar pretiouxe and worthy, is maiſt terreble, of al thing that may be Thocht. Ande in-ſamekle as the ſaull Is mare pretious &amp; worthy than The body, in-ſamekle is the ded of It mare perulus and doutable to be tholyt.  Ande the ded of synfull man, but ſufficiant Repentans, is euer ill, as the dede of gude men, how ſoding or terreble at euer It be, is gude &amp; pretious before gode: For the dede of gude men is nocht ell bot the paſing of perſonis Retwrnynge fra banaſynge, offputyng of a full hevy byrdinge, end of all ſeknes, eſchevyng of perellys, the terme of all Ill, the brekinge of al bandys, the payment of naturell det, the agane-cumynge to the kynde lande, ande the entering to perpetuall Joy and welfare; And tharfor the day of ded o neide men is better than the day of thar byrthe; And ſa thai that ar all weill ſchrewyne, and deis in the faithe and ſacrementis of haly<EPB/><PB N="2" ID="pb.2"/>

Thai that are in the artykle of ded has vþer temptations be the deuill, and mar merualus, than euer þai had in thare lyfe; Fyrſt, the deuil tempis a man in his deing in the faith of haly kyrk, For but faythe may na man be ſaufe.  And It is the grund of al gud deid, þer-for þe deuill aſſais, gif he can gare ony man vare in the treuth, as to put to hyme, that he wald neuer dee For synaris, na be borne of the vergyne mary, &amp; ſafurth, of the new testament.  And þerfore ilk temporall man ſuld trow as haly wryt ſais, and namly that his curat tech-is hyme, ande have his hart fermly Set þerone.  Ande he that is in the artykle houre of dede ſuld have a man to raherß to hyme the poyntis of þe trouthe, in ſyk langage þat he mycht wnderſtande, Rycht oft, fore It gret comfort to hyme, and the deuil may nocht heire It : alſua þai ſuld raherß to hyme the gret faith and paciens of marterys ande vthire haly men, how wychtly þai ſuſtenyt al tormentis and paſſionys done to thaim, for the faith of haly kyrke, and ourcome thar ennemys by paciens and ferme faith, as men may Reid in thar ſtoreis.  For he that is ferme in the faith optenis tharthrow al that is profytable to the ſaull and lyf baith, and It is to wyt quhat temtacioune at euer the deuill putis to man, ſal nocht noy hyme, bot gyf he wyl fully conſent thar-to and at he be in his rycht mynd.  For in the houre of ded the deuill wyll caſt<EPB/><PB N="3" ID="pb.3"/>
mony wreukis of falſait the quhilk Suld nocht be trowyt, for he is our auld enemye and faþer of leiſingis.  The threuth is fundyt apone this, that god with-ſaif to tak mankynd to Radem the treſpas that adam and Eue commytyt in paradice, quhar-throw al mankynde was ſmitit, &amp; nan was worthy of his ofſpryng to pay that ranſone for the oreginall ſyne at thai ware fylyt with, for god herys na ſynaris; and tharfor god, throw his mekyll merſy, send his anerly ſone to be incarnat, ſen nan was worthy þer-to, bot he; for he was na ſynar, and hervpone is fowndit al the faithe, the quhilk was confermit be ſancte Johne the baptyſt, and mony oþer prophetis, or cryſt was borne mony a hundred  ȝhir.  The toþer temptacioune that the deuill tempis a man with, Is diſpar of godis mekille merſye; for quhen the deuill fyndis a man wexit and torment with ſeknes, he bryngis to his mynd þe ded that <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="folio"/>he Is lyk to cum to, and the ſynis that he has done, wnconfeſſyt of or Rapentyt, and na penans, na condigne ſatiſfaccione maid for þaim, and puttish yme In dyſpare of mercy, and thus he ekys ſorow upone ſorow to confound hyme.  And as haly ſcripture ſais, ilke man ſal se, in the hour of ded, cryſt as he was crucefyd one the cors, in conſolacioune to gud men, and in confuſioune and ſchame to Ill men, at thai ar nocht worthy to <CORR SIC="him.">have</CORR> thaim to thare bruþer rademar &amp; helpare: and this is a perelus temptacioune.  Neuer-the-leß, þocht a man had done als mony ſynnis as thare is dropis in the ſey, or al the ſynnis in the werlde hyme alane, and he had neuer ben ſchrewyne befor, till the houre of ded, ſa at thare-of he mycht haf ſuffiſſand contriſcione, he war ſauf; fore godis mercy is abwne al his werkis, and he may nocht deny mercy treuly askyt: bot It is the ſykireſt to manis ſaluacioune to be ſchrewyne, and do worthy penans, tyll he Is in proſperyte; and þocht a man mycht nocht have ſpace to aſk mercy, tharfor ſuld he nocht dyſpare, fore that ware mar ekyne of ſorow to hyme.  And this is ane generall prouerb, that ſyne noyis nocht that is ſufficiandly for-thocht, and the pocy of the croß ſchawis the mercy of Criſt, for he hange þer-one, Inclynand the hed to the heryng, the mouth to þe kyſing, the<EPB/><PB N="4" ID="pb.4"/>
armys to the embraiſing, the handis to the gevyn, and al his body to the Rademyng of Synaris, and ſua ſuld na man be dyſparyt of godys mercy: For in enſampill thare-of he gaif to the maiſt ſynare maiſt mercy and grace, as to Petyr at denyd hyme, to Paul at perſewyt hyme, to matho the okyrar, to magdalyne the ſynare, till dauid the murtherſar and adultrare, to þe theif that hang beſyd hyme one the cros, and to mony vthir that war lange to raherß. The [þrid] temptacioune is in-paciens or vntholmudnes, the quhilk is nocht to luf god abwne al thinge, &amp; to thank hyme of al his ſayndes and gyftes, at ar al fore the beſt, and thai war weill knawing, thai that trawalys in the artykle of ded, bot gyf þai be cumyne to the natural cours of eilde, the quilk few cumys to; For ma deis of exces and myſgouernans in youthed, than is ſlane into batell; thir men, for the ſtrenthe at thai have of complexioune, <CORR SIC="ar">or</CORR> laith to de, and ſa thai thole in thar ſeknes meruolus dolur and infirmyte, the quhilk thai tak nocht in paciens, for the luf of god, as he dyd for þaim quhen he ſufferyt ded: for he opnyt na mare his mouth na the lam dois quhen his throt is wnder the knyf; and ſua mony of thir men gangis rammyß, vthir ſum mermwrys, and <MILESTONE N="2b" UNIT="folio"/>thinkis that payne vrangwys, and gruchis, and ſwa thai obey nocht with gud hart to the ordynans and rychtwyß Iugment of god; and tharfor It is nedfull to al men, in the tyme of that dyſeß, to think and to knaw that his ſynis aw to have mar pwnyſcioune than he may tholl; for al the payne that euer we tholl, Is rychtwyſnes : and þe gud at we gete is of grace, and thar-for a verray penytent man thinkis al his ſeknes lytill, in compareſone one-to the luf at god ſchawyt till ws, and to the Redemptioune of our treſpas.  Ande Sen the ſeknes, at we have her, is gevyne ws in part of our purgatory, it ſuld be blychtly reſauit, and als al the tribulation and ſorow at we may tholl here, Is nocht worthy to be maid compareſone to the Ioy of hevyne, that in the paciens thar-of we may wyne.  For ſwetnes is þe better knawing, at ſwetnes has ben befor taiſtyt.

And thus a man ſuld with al his hart conforme hyme to haf paciens, thankand god, without murmur, of that payne, and ſa to wyne hyme ſelf.  For euer the temptatione at man tholys in the hour of ded Is pryd; for quhen the deuill ſeis that he may nocht dyſeſſ a man in þe faith of the kirk, na [be] diſperacione of godis mercy, na be inpaciens of his ſeknes,<ADD>þe find.</ADD> than tempis he hyme, ſayand thus, "þu art nocht as vthir men are, þow art ſtrenthy in thi face, &amp; in the hop of the mercy of god þow art wycht and tholmud in to ſeknes, and þow has done mony gud deid, and þerfore þow nedys na mercy, bot al the thank þar-of."  This  preſumptioune is Rycht perelus, and a fell temptacioune, and for-thy a man ſuld think, that all his euill dedis cumys of hyme ſelf and all his gud dedys cumys of grace, and the gyft of god; &amp; ſykirly, ay þe bettyr man, ay þe mar lawly; and quhen the ymagynacioune of a manis gud dedis cumis by the temptatioune of the deuill, he ſuld brynge to his mynd his Ill dedis, at thai ma law hyme, and bryng hyme to knaw his fragelyte, and to aſk mercy, and nocht to pryd hyme In his gud dedis.  For to have pryd of his gud dedis is a temptacioune callyt preſumcioune; and dreid of the mercy <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="folio"/>of god [Is]<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.2">This word is in the MS.</NOTE1>  for Ill dedis Is ane vthir temptacioune callyt dyſpar; and he that can weill eſchef thir twa, in the hour of ded, ourcumys the deuill.  For euer the fyft temptacioune that the deuill tempys a man, Is in hes warldly gudis: he thinkis dyſeß to leif his gret Riches mowable or wnmouable, his wyf and barnis, and ſik oþer pleſans; and ſyker It is quha takes hyme ſorow or dyſes, in the levyng of thir cardenall delytes, that he is nocht ſykyre in the faith.  For and he de, as he ſuld de, he ſuld think that he ſuld pas to mare Ioy na fore to leif ſic tranſytorie warldis gudis, the quhilk are lent hyme bot For a tyme pleſand to god to tholl, or as ane Inſtrument to vyne hymeſelf to hevyne, as ane hamyr is ane inſtrument to<EPB/><PB N="6" ID="pb.6"/>
mak a knyf wyth.  Bot the deuill tempis men ſua in thar varldly gudis, that wylfully þai ga to the deuill fore thaim, and quhen thai wat at thai mone dee, thai wyll nocht glaidly part with þaim, na thol the ordynans of god þerof, at thar powar, na ȝhit þer dettis to be payt, bot erar deſyre at thar barnis and thar wyvys be poſſeſſyt of þaim, quheþer þai be cumyne falſly or Rychtwyſly, thinkand thar ryches nocht able to be dyſponyt fore þar ſaulys, or to mak Satiſfaccioune with thaim gyf þai Ware vrangwyſly vonyng, trowand at god has na cur of thi[r] barnis, to grant thaim riches, bot gif at thai dyſpone al vpone thaim: and ſic folkes ſuld erar be callyt beſtes vnracionable, than man raſonable; for beſtis knawis na thing bot erde and warldly thingis, by the reſone of the erde at thai ar maid off.  Men ſuld knaw þe hewyne, by Reſone of the ſaull that come, and was maid thar-by go amang the angell.  And thus he, that vald weill ourcum this temptacione, ſuld thank god of his grace, at lent hyme thir warldly gudis to help hyme with, anerly to his end; thankand hyme thar-of, and gyfand thaim to hyme gladly agane, till his fre diſpoſeſione: for noþer wyf, nore barnis, na oþer riches, ar lang gevyne. And thus, nocht aganeſtandand, teſtament or oþer diſpoſicione, at the law lewys, may be maid; bot man aw to part with thir gudis glaidly, by the ordynance of god, as is befor ſaid. And thus he that ſuld de, ſuld gladly de, thinkand fore the better to lefe the were; and than the ded, pacyently tholyt, makis ſatiſfaccioune, nocht al-anerly of the vaneall ſynys, bot als, quhen It is deſyryt, fore þe luf of god, and to be with hyme, for mony dedly ſynis.  Bot the <MILESTONE N="3b" UNIT="folio"/>deuil tempis oft tymis mony men ſa in thar temporall gudis, at quhen thai ar in the hour of ded, thai will nocht here ſpek at thai ſyld de; the quhilk is our crewell to criſtin men to be tholyt.  And It is to vnderſtand, at in thir temptaciouns the deuill may ſtrenȝe na man, na ȝhit our-cum hyme, bot gyf It be his fre conſent, and be in his rycht mynde. And tharfor we ſuld thank god, at tholys ws nocht to be tempyt Forþer than we ma agane-ſtand; And we reſiſt his temptacions, we ſal have þerfor gret reward in hevyne; and ſwa temptacions Is rycht prophetable tyll ws, for pur borne men<EPB/><PB N="7" ID="pb.7"/>
cumys nocht to honore slepand, bot erar by gret trawell and dyſes; and al man is born of the hewyne, baniſt þerof in pouertee, fore his ſynis, redemyt thar-to agane by the faith and the paſſione of cryſt, he vynand the meryt þerof by gud dedis and trew lawbor, or ell to remayne in that banaſing fore euer in hell.  Efter the dear be informyt of thir temptaciouns, at will be put to hyme, he ſuld be demandyt, Fyrſt, gyf he be blycht at he deis in the faith of criſt and of haly kirk, and ſyne gyf he grantis at he has nocht leuit rycht wyſly, as he aucht to do, and gyf he forthinkis his myſdedis, and gif he has wyll to mend thaim at his poware.  Syne ſuld he ask at hym, gyf he trowis that criſt, godis ſonne our lord, deit for hym, and al ſynaris; and gif he thankes hyme thar of with al his hart, And gyf he trowis ony oþer ways than be the faith of hym and ded to be ſauf.  Than byd hyme be ſtark and ſykir in that faith, and have hop of nan vthir thinge for temptacioune of the deuill: and gif thi ſynis be laid befor the by the angell gud or Ill, ſay than, "the paſſioune of criſt I put betuex me and my ſynis, &amp; betuex me and the eternall ded, the ded of criſt."  And alſua, he ſuld be examynit in the article of the treuth, that is to ſay, gyf he trowis in the faþer, and in the ſone, and the haly gaiſt, and ane anerly god, makar of hevyne and erde; and in our lord Ihesu criſt, anerly ſone to god by natur, at our lady mary, euervyrgyne, conſauit by þe werkis of the haly gaist, but ſeid of man: the quhilk tholyt ded one the corß, for ws ſynaris, and was grawyne and diſcendyt to hell, to radem our elderis at had hope of his cumyne.

Als þe ſek man ſuld aſk mercy with al his hart, of the ſynis done agane þe lufe, gudnes, and mycht of god, and erar for the luf of god, than for dreid of ony payne.   He ſuld pray mekil til god, to gif hyme grace till haf knawleg of the ſynis that he haß forȝit, to that end that he may the better mak amendis þerof; alſua, he ſuld ſykirly think that in caß he mend of that ſeknes, that he ſal neuer wylfully ſyne in thai ſynis, na in na vthir dedly: For in the thocht, at the ſaull paſſys fra the body, is tan For euer, and thar after ched or rewardyt ay leſtandly, as the angell was in the begynyng.  He ſuld als forgyf al kynd of man, of all actione hartfully, and aſk forgyvnes of god and man ; For as he forgewys, he ſall be forgewyne.

Item, I ſaid in my mynd and thocht, that I ſuld absten me fra vice, &amp; at I ſuld ſet al my hart to wyſdome, and vmbethow all erouris and foleys, quhill I ſaw quhat war maiſt ſpedfule to manis ſone in erde.  Item, quhen I had al thingis conſederit, I fand at this was ane of the maiſt ſpedfull thingis Fore mans ſone in this erd, wnder the hewyne, that euery man hav in mynd the dait of his dais, and of the ſchort tyme that he has hire to byd, and ſpend It weill in gud oyß.

Item he ſais, It is better to deſſir the thing þow ſeis nocht that is the Joy of hevyne, na the thing þow ſeis in this warld, for the tan is bot temporale and corruptable, and the tothir is perpetuall.   Item he ſais, quhat man is to cum in this warld, his name is now writin ande writin weill that he is aman; for na thing is bot at var, na thar was na thing bot at Is.

But it is ſpedful to gouerne hyme wyſly in this present pilgrimage, quhilk paſſis as a ſchadow daily, or quha can tel hyme quha ſal ſucced til hyme afterwart, or quhat ſal hapin in tyme to cum?  Item he ſais, it is better a gud name na mekil riches in this warld or ony othir precious Iowell, ſen he mone pas of this varlde and wat nocht the hour na day, and at the day of his birth is the begynyng of his ded.

Item he ſais, It is better to cum to the houß off ernyſt na to the houß of blychtnes, and to the houß of ſadnes na to the houß of Joy, and better is crabing na blychtnes or laiching; for the tane forȝettis to think one the end, and the toþer thinkis one the vanite of this warld; for vyſmen are ay ſad, and fulys ay blycht, and oft tymis be the ſad contina[n]s of a wyſman fulis are correkit and amendyt of thar wyte. Item he ſais, better is to be correkit with a wyſman, na to be flethit with a full, and the ſtrublyne of fulys crabis the viſman, and gar þaim tyne his frendſchip and fauoris of his harte; and better is the fliting of a frend, nar þe fleching of a full.

Item he ſais, men ſuld nocht argwe, quhy the tyme bygane vas better na the tyme at is. Item he ſais, visdome is nocht profyt, but riches; na riches na worth, but wiſdome; for riches beris wyſdome befor princes &amp; defendis.  Item he ſais, wyſdome with riches makis the poſſeſſor <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="folio"/>her till have honore and gud endinge.  Item he ſais, that na man may fynde faultis to correk werkis that he has maid.  Item he ſais, that the gret god knawis al manis curage; and ſum fore the viſdome, he cheß til hym ſelfe, and vthir ſum he diſpiß and rafuß for thar wan-wyt and foleis.

Item he ſais, It is gret vanite that al thinge that cumis in this warld, to pure and to riche, to wyſman &amp; to full, al is kepit wncertane, to the end that na man wat quheþer he be worthy to Joy, or to payne, in the warld to cum.
