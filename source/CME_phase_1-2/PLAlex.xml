the sea, and the order of the heavens (betokening the way of the stars
and the turning of the skies), have bequeathed these things to the
whole world through the highness and the wisdom of magic knowledge.
And they tell of a king of that land, by name Anectanabus, great in
understanding, and full of love in astrology and mathematics.  Now,
upon a day it happened that a messenger came, and said unto him that
Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, was drawing nigh towards him with a
very great force of foes.  Yet he did not call out his army, nor get
ready his advance.  Instead of this, he hurried into his bed-chambers
in his palace, and, taking down a brazen shell, which was full of
rain-water, and holding in his hand a brazen rod, sought by magic
spells to summon the devils.  By which wizardry he felt, in the shell
itself, the fleets sailing over him amid fearful affray.</P><P>Now there were lords of Anectanabus set in sway over his armies to guard
the Persian border.</P><P>And one hapless man coming to him, besought
him: 'O most mighty King Anectanabus, there ariseth against thee
Artaxerxes, the king of the Persians, with an untold horde of foes and
strange races.  For they are Parthians, Medes, Persians, Syrians,
Mesopotamians, Brapes, Phares, Argiri, Chaldaeans, Bachiri, Confires,
Hircanians, and Agiophii, and many other folks coming from Eastern
lands.'  On hearing this, Anectanabus said, sighing: 'The trust that I
gave to thee, heed thou right well; yet thy prowess hath not been the
prowess of a doughty man, but the doings of a cowardly fellow.  For
worth showeth itself, not in the greatness of the folk, but in the
steadfastness of their souls.  Dost thou not know one lion putteth
many<EPB/><PB N="2"/>
does to flight?'  And having said these words, he went into his
chamber alone, and made brazen shells, and filled them with
rain-water, and held in his hand a palm rod, and gazing into this,
began, as hard as he could, to utter spells, and beheld how the
Egyptians were being smitten down at the onslaught of the Barbarians'
ships.</P><P>Forthwith he changed his dress, and shaved his head and
beard, and took gold as much as he might bear, and which might be
needful to him to busy himself with wizardry.  And thus he fled from
Egypt, near by Pelusium.  And at length, coming into Ethiopia, he put
on linen apparel, [and] in the guise of an Egyptian seer went into
Macedonia.  And there he sate himself, and before all the Greeks, and
in their sight was soothsaying.  But the Egyptians, when they saw how
Anectanabus was not at Court, went to Serapis, who was their greatest
god, and besought him that he might give them answer as to Anectanabus
their king.  And Serapis replied: 'Anectanabus, your king, is gone
from Egypt because of Artaxerxes, the king of the Persians, who will
subdue you unto his lordship.  Nevertheless, when a short time hath
flown by, he will come back to shake off his thraldom, and will be
avenged on your foes, and yoke them under you.'  And as soon as they
had got this answer, they made a kingly statue out of a black stone,
in honour of Anectanabus.  And they wrote on it, at his feet, this
saying, that it might be handed down for their offspring to think of.
But Anectanabus remained in Macedonia, nor was he known.</P></ADD></P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="PLAlex:2" TYPE="section"><HEAD>How Anectanabus went up to the
Palace to Olympia the Queen.</HEAD><P><ADD><P>In the meantime, Philip,
king of Macedonia, went out to battle.  But Anectanabus went forward
to the palace, that he might behold Olympia the queen, and see how
fair she was.  And when he saw her, his heart was smitten with love of
her, and stretching forth his hand, he greeted her, saying, 'Hail,
Queen of Macedonia,' disdaining to call her 'lady'.  And she, Olympia,
answered him, speaking thus: 'Hail, master, come thou and sit near.'
And when he sate thus, Olympia<EPB/><PB N="3"/>
asked many things of him.  'Art thou not an Egyptian?'  And
Anectanabus answered: 'The word thou saidst was kingly, when thou
didst name the Egyptians.  For the Egyptians are wise, and read
dreams, understand the birds of the air in their flight, open up the
hidden places, and tell the fate of those newborn, babes.  Of all
these things, as a seer, I, too, have knowledge.'  And Olympia saw how
he gazed upon her, and spoke, 'Master, of what dost thou bethink thee,
who thus lookest on me?'  And Anectanabus answered, 'I call to my mind
many answers of the gods.  One answer had been that I was to look upon
a queen.'  And saying this, he drew forth from his breast a cleansing
tablet of bronze and ivory, inwrought with gold and silver, and on its
face were three whirls.  The first contained in itself the Twelve
Minds, and in the third, sun and moon were fashioned. Next to them,
was seen a chain of ivory, and from it he pulled forth sever
wonder-bright stars, that told the hours and birth-dooms of men, and
seven carven stones, and two stones for the saving men whole.</P><P>And Olympia beheld these things, and said: 'Master, if thou
wouldst I should believe thee, tell me the year, the day and hour of
the king's birth.'  And upon this, he said to the queen, 'Wishest thou
to hear nothing else from me?'  Quoth the queen, 'Tell me what shall
fall out betwixt Philip and me, for men say that, when Philip shall
come from the war, he will thrust me forth, and take another mate.'
And Anectanabus answered: 'They prate of many things untruly; but ere
a long time pass, it shall be as they say.'  And the queen answered:
'I beg thee, master, unveil me all the truth.'  Thereupon
Anectanabus:�'One of the mightiest gods shall share thy bed and
uphold thee through all thy thrivings and downfalls, even if they be
overstrong.'  Olympia replied: 'I beseech thee, say what shape this
god shall put on?'  Anectanabus replied: 'Neither young, nor old; his
beard besprinkled with white hairs.  Wherefore, if this please thee,
be ready for him, for at night shalt thou see him, and in thy sleep
shall he lie by thee.'  The queen said: 'If I behold this, neither as
a seer, nor as godly, but, as the god himself, will I worship' [thee].
And at once Anectanabus said, 'Fare thee well, O queen.'  After this
Anectanabus, leaving the palace, and walking straight forth<EPB/><PB N="4"/>
to the city's camp in a desert spot, tore up herbs, and ground them,
and took their juice, and wrought spells and other like things of the
fiend, that in that same night Olympia might behold the god Hamon
lying beside her, and saying to her thereafter, 'Woman, thou hast
conceived him who shall beshield thee.'  And, on the morrow, Olympia
awoke from her slumbers, and called Anectanabus to her, and told him
of the dream she had beheld.  Then Anectanabus said: 'If thou wilt
give me room in the palace, thou shalt see the god himself, face to
face.  For that god shall come to thee in the shape of a great snake,
and soon after, taking on a manlike body, he shall seem to be in my
likeness.'  And to this Olympia said: 'As thou hast spoken, master,
do.  Take to thyself a bed in the palace, and canst thou make good the
truth thereof, I will deem thee to be the father of the boy.'  And,
about the first watch of the night, Anectanabus took on him, through
spells and wizardry to be changed into the shape of a great snake, and
whistling on to the bedchamber of Olympia, to fly through.  And he
entered her room, and rose on to her bed, and with great love began to
kiss her, and the kisses betokened to her who he was.  And when he
rose up from the bed, he smote her on the womb, and spake: 'This
begetting be thy avenging, and in no wise may it be upbraided of
men.'</P><P>On such a fashion was Olympia cheated, who had lain with a
man as though he had been a god.  And in the morning, Anectanabus went
down from the palace, and the queen was with child.</P><P>And when she
began to be big, she called unto her Anectanabus, saying: 'Master,
tell me, what doom will Philip wreak on me, when he shall come back?'
And Anectanabus said to her, 'Be not afraid: god Hamon will champion
thee.'  And with these words he left the palace, and went outside the
town, to a barren spot.  And, uprooting grasses, rubbed them, and
grated them, and took their sap.  And he caught a sea-bird, and began
to sing over the herbs, and anoint the herbs with the sap.  This he
did in fellowship with the fiends, that he might betray King Philip
through a dream.  And this was brought about.  That same night the god
Hamon appeared to Philip, in a dream, lying with his wife Olympia,
and, the night ended, he <EPB/><PB N="5"/>saw him touch her womb, and seal it
with a golden ring.  And on the ring there was a stone, and graven on
this a lion's head, and the chariot of the sun, and a very sharp
sword.  And he said to her: 'Woman, thou hast conceived thy saviour.'
And Philip awoke from his sleep, and calling Arideus, made known to
him the dream, and what he had seen.  And Arideus said: 'Philip, not
from man, but from a god, hath thy wife conceived.  In truth, the
lion's head and the chariot of the sun and the sharp sword, foretoken
that he, who shall be born of her, shall journey to the East whence
riseth the sun!  And with the sharp sword shall he underyoke to
himself the nations of the whole world.'</P></ADD></P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="PLAlex:3" TYPE="section"><HEAD>How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Mighty Dragon
went to the fore in front of Philip and overcame his Enemies in the
Fray.</HEAD><P><ADD>In the meanwhile, King Philip fought and won.  For
there appeared in the battle a dragon, who went before him and laid
low his foes.  And when he came back to Macedonia, he met and kissed
Olympia.  And King Philip gazed upon her, and said, 'To whom, O
Olympia, hast thou given thyself up.  For sinned thou hast, yet not
sinned, for as much as thou hast brooked frowardness from a god.  But
I have seen all that has been done by a god on thee, in a dream:
therefore be blameless in my eyes, and the eyes of all men!'</ADD></P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="PLAlex:4" TYPE="section"><HEAD>How Anectanabus in the Shape of a
Dragon came before Philip at a Festival and kissed
Olympia.</HEAD><P><ADD>On a certain day Philip was feasting with his
lords and chieftains of Macedonia and with Olympia his wife.  And
Anectanabus through wizardry took on himself the shape of a dragon,
and, passing through the midst of the couch whereon they lay apart,
whistled so loudly that all the revellers were stricken with fear, and
the greatest dread, and coming near Olympia, he put his head on her
breast and kissed her.  Philip, seeing this, spoke to Olympia, 'Woman,
thee and all I tell; beheld this dragon, what time I laid my enemies
low.'</ADD></P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="PLAlex:5" TYPE="section"><EPB/><PB N="6"/><HEAD>How a Bird laid an Egg in Philip's Bosom at whose breaking there came forth a Serpent, which forthwith died.</HEAD><P><ADD><P>And a few days after
this Philip the king was sitting in his palace, and there appeared
unto him a little and most gentle bird, which flew into his bosom and
laid an egg.  And the egg, falling to the ground, was broken.  And at
once there crept forth from it a very little snake.  And it turned
around, wishful to go into the egg, but, before it might put in its
head, it was quenched.  And Philip, seeing this, was heavily
distressed, and called to him Arideus, and showed him the monstrous
thing he had seen.  And Arideus said to him, 'King Philip, a son shall
be born to thee, who shall reign after thy death, and shall fare forth
over the whole world and sway all peoples, and ere he come back to the
land of his birth, shall die by a most swift death.'  </P><P>And as
the time of child-birth was drawing nigh, Olympia began to feel pain,
and her womb was tormented, and she bade Arideus be called to her, and
spoke with him: 'Master, my womb is wrenched with very heavy labours.'
Anectanabus<NOTE1 N="*" ID="n1">sic in both editions 1489 and 1494</NOTE1> then spake:
'Raise thyself awhile from thy throne, for in this hour the elements
are troubled by the sun.'  This was done, and the pain went from her.
And soon after, Anectanabus said to her, 'Sit down, O Queen!' and she
sate herself and bore a child.  And as soon as the boy was fallen on
to the earth, a mighty thunderclap and thunderbolts, with tokens and
lightnings came about throughout the whole world.  Then night was
spread forth and lasted, it reaching unto the last hour of day.  Then
parts of the clouds fell down in Italy.  And seeing these signs,
Philip the king was afrighted, and went in to Olympia, and said: 'I
deemed that this little babe should in no wise be fostered.  For he is
not conceived of me, but of some god, for at his birth I beheld the
heavens changed.  Yet let him be fostered in my memory, as though he
were my son, and follow in the stead of a son I begot through another
wife.'  And when he said this, she handled the babe with great care.
And the boy's face had the likeness neither of father nor mother.  The
hair on his head<EPB/><PB N="7"/> was shaggy as a lion's.  His eyes glistened
like the stars, but each beamed with its own hue, one black, the other
yellow.  And his teeth were sharp, and his eager rush as a lion's.
His shape foreshadowed his energy and forethought.  By his parents he
was called Alexander.  In the schools, and wheresoever he sate, he
strove with them in letters and disputations, and by his keen
swiftness won the mastership.  And when he was twelve years old, he
was beweaponed for battle, and excelled in arms.  And Philip, seeing
how quick he was, praised him, and said: 'Son Alexander, I love thy
speed, and wit of mind for its work.  But I am sore and feel foolish
that thy form is no unlike mine.'  And Olympia heard this, and was
greatly afraid.  And she called hither Anectanabus, and said: 'Master,
learn from me what Philip misdeemeth.  For he said to Alexander, "Son,
I love thy speed and wit of mind.  But, that thy shape is unlike mine,
I am saddened."'  And Anectanabus began to think, and said: 'His
thought is nowise harmful.'  And gazing aloft as he was wont, he
looked on a certain star, and riddled out his wish.  And when
Alexander heard this, he spake: 'The star thou seest is seen in the
heavens?'  And Anectanabus replied: 'My son, it is.'  Alexander said:
'Canst thou show it unto me?'  Anectanabus answered: 'Follow me in the
hour of night, and I will show it unto thee.'  Alexander said: 'Thy
fate is not known to thee, or uncertain?'  Anectanabus replied:
'Enough of this.'  Alexander said: 'I would fain know it.'
Anectanabus answered: 'In truth know that from my son shall come my
death.'  This said, as he went down from the palace, Alexander
followed him in the hour of the evening without the city.  And when
they arrived up on to the ditch of the city, Anectanabus spake: 'Son
Alexander, gaze thou on the stars; look how the star of Hercules is
perplexed, and how Mercury's star is blithe.  If I see Jove sparkling,
my doom telleth me of my coming death at the hands of my son.'  At
this sight Alexander came up nigh to him, and made an onslaught on
him, making him fall</P></ADD>

was brought to him and he did the same, and thus too with a third.
And those who bore the cups, seeing this, gave the news to the Emperor
Darius.  And he, hearing of it, rose up; saying: 'Friend, what is this
that thou doest, hiding the cups in thy breast?' And Alexander: 'In our
king's feasts the guests are wont, whenever they will, to take their
drinking-vessels.  But, as this seemeth to you unworthy, I will give
them back forthwith.'  And with these words he gave them back to the
cup-bearers.  But the Persians who sate at the feast said each to
each, 'a good custom, indeed, and one to be praised.'  And some lords,
too, praised this way and exalted it.  But one of the Princes of
Darius, called Anapolus, sitting at the feast, gazed hard at Alexander
and his face.  For he had seen him when, at Darius' bidding, he went
into Macedonia to take tribute of Philip.  He, knowing his voice and
looking on his face, began to think to himself and say: 'Is this not
Alexander?'  And rising at once he drew near to Darius, saying: 'This
messenger whom thou beholdest is Alexander, the son of Philip of
Macedon.'  And Alexander, seeing them with each other in talk, knew
they were speaking of him and he was known.  And at this he rose up
from his place and leapt away from the board.  And taking a blazing
torch from a Persian's hand, himself mounted his palfrey, which he
found ready outside Darius's palace, and fled in the swiftest flight.
And the Persian seeing this, taking weapons, mounted their steeds with
a mighty stir, and quickly followed after Alexander.  And in the
darkness of the nightfall, they began to stray, some scratched their
faces by the tree-boughs, some falling into ditches.  But Alexander,
bearing his blazing torch in hand, fared straight<EPB/><PB N="48"/>
forward.  Now, Darius sate on his throne and thought of Alexander and
how great his daring was.  He saw a statue of gold of Xerxes the
Persian king, who sate below the high-seat in the hall.  And at once
the statue broke and was all scattered asunder.  And Darius seeing
this was smitten with heaviness of heart and began to weep sorely and
long.  And he said: 'This foretokeneth the wasting of my life, and the
utter downfall of the Persian kingdom.'  Alexander, however, coming to
the river Grancus, found it swollen, and leapt athwart it.  But ere he
was over the stream burst its banks, and swept his horse away; with
great hardship Alexander escaped and met Eumulus, his lord.  And thus
he went back to his army and told them of Darius, how he had dealt
with him, and the torch with which he had fled away.</ADD></P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="PLAlex:6" TYPE="section"><HEAD>HOW ALEXANDER PUT HEART INTO HIS HOST ANEW.</HEAD><P><ADD>And on the following day, he gathered his army, which told two hundred and

Alexander called to him the messengers of Darius, and before all spoke

And soon after this, stirred by ruth, he gave word none should dare

which the Kings and Deemsters of Persia were of old buried.  And
digging into this field the Macedonians found in the graves gemmed
vases.  And there they found the grave of Ninus the King of Assyria
and Persia, which was hollowed out of a single amethyst, and engraven
on the outside with palm-leaves and sundry kinds of birds.  And so
bright was the amethyst that even from the outside the man's body
appeared whole.  And in this place was a narrow and evil tower on

be restored every one to his own. For Darius kept them in prison,
since they were of noble birth, and awarded all their possessions to
