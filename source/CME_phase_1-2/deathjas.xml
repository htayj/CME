that thay were so neghe of the Kynges blode

bot so abode still yn the lande the Kyng's cumyng

with many other of thare afinite, the saide Kynge
of Scottis lete arrest, and hem severally yn diverse
castell full hard prisoned, till he had fondon meanes
and wais for to do hem lawfully to deth, as false
traitours, because of the false murdure of his brother
the duke of Rosay. Whos deth the people of the
land sore grutched, and mowrnid; seying that thay
suppoised and ymagynd that the Kyng did rather
that vigorious execucion upon the Lordes of his
kyne for the covetise of thare possessions and goodes,
thane for any other rightfull cause, althofe he fonde
colourabill wais to serve his entent yn the contrarye.</P><P>All thos thinges thus done, the saide kynge of
Scottes, noght stanchid of his unsacionable and
gredi avarice, ordeynd that tallage, and other
imposicions upon his people, gretter and more
chargeant then ever were acustumyd afore that tyme. So
that the comoners of his land secretly clepid hym
nat rightwes, bot a tirannous prynce, what for the
outrageous imposicious importables of use, on taxes
and tallages, upon his poure subjectes and peple.
But after the wisdome of some philosophers the
comone langage of the peiple oft spekith without
reason. Nevertheless many of the Lordes of that
land, dredyng sore of the harme that myght betide,
drowghe hem to counsell how thay myght withstand
and resist the Kynges tyranye, sithe he hade so litill
pite of the dethe done to hyme of his Lordes, many

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000006" N="8"/>

of hem beyng so negh of his roiall blode, and also
of the gredi covatise that he oppressid and enpoverisid
his comonalte. Withall the Kyng beyng present
yn his said cownesell, rose up with a maneli
swollon hart a knyght, clepid Sir Robert Grame, a
grete gentilman and an Erles sune, a mane of grete
wit and eloquence, wundir suttilye wittyd, and ex-
pert in the lawe: saying thes wordes opynly to the
Lordes, "Sirs, yf ye woll firmely stand by that at
I shall say to the Kyng, yn youre audience, I trust
to God that we shall fynde a good remedye and
helpe." To the which sayng the Lordes cosentid:
and saide that they trustyrig holly yn his prudent
and discret manehode, wold conforme and consent,
yn hie and low, to mayntene all that he wold tak
on hand to say, for the general weele of hem, and
of all that land, yn that mater by hym than mevid.</P><P>Upon this the Kyng lete to somond a parliament
of the iii astatis of his rewme, where this same Sir
Robert Grame, fully sette and asurid and purposid
to performe that at he had behight and promysid
unto the Lordes, as is afore rehersid: He rose upe
with a grete corage, with a violent chere and
countenance, sette handes upon the Kyng sayng thes
wordes, "I arrest you yn the name of all the thre
astates of your reume, here now assemblid yn this
present parliament, for right as youre liege peple
be bundun and sworne to obeye your Majeste noble
riall, yn the same wise bene ye sworne and ensurid
to kepe youre peple, to kepe and guverne youre
lawe, so that ye do hem no wronge, bot yn all right
mantene and defend hem."  And there and then
forthwith the said Sir Robert Grame, asuryng hym

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000007" N="9"/>

fully yn the promyse made unto hym bi the said
Lordes, said, "Is hit nat thus as I say?" Unto
the which sayng none of all the astates afore rehersid
wold, ne durst speke oone word, bot kapid silence.
The Kyng therwith percevyng all this presumptuous
rebellion, and wirchyng of the said Sir Robert
Grame, gretly movyd and stirryd ayenst him, as that
reason wold, lete do hym arrest, and commandid to
put hym yn sure and hard prisone.</P><P>This Sir Robert Grame, seyng hymself thus desavyd
there of the said Lordes, spake and said yn
this wise, "He that serveth a comon mane, he
serveth by short procese of tyme." After this the
Kynge exiled this Sir Robert Grame; and all his
haritages and goodes deemed as forfaturs to the
Kyng.</P><P>Upon his exile this Sir Robert Grame toke his
[way] ynto the cuntreis of the Wild Scottis, wherthat
he conspired and ymagynd  how that he myght
destruye his Kyng. And furthwith he renounsed
his legeance, and by wordes, and by writyng,
defied hem, seying that he had destruyd hym, his
wif, and his childerne, his haritages, and all his
other godes, by his cruell tyranny. Wherfor he
said he wold slee hym [with] his owne handes as
his mortall enmye, yf wer he myght se tyme, and
fynd wais and meanes. Therto the Kyng, hugely
vexid in his spretes with the traturous and malicious
rebellion of the said Sir Robert Grame, did mak an
opyn proclamacion by all the rewme of Scotteland
that whoso myght slee or tak hyme, and bryng hym
to the Kynges presence, shuld have iii thousand

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000008" N="10"/>

demyes of gold, every pece worth half an Englissh
Noble.</P><P>Nocht long after this the Kynglete lete so ordeyne
his parliament yn due forme, at Edenbourghe, somunde
yn the yere of oure lord A Thousand, Foure
Hundreth, Six and Thirtye, yn the fest of All Hallowen.
To the which parliament the said Sir Robert
Grame stired a full cruell vengance ayene the
Kyng, sent privie messages and letturs to certayne
men and servantes of the Duke of Albayne, whome
the Kyng a litill afore hade done rigorusly to deth,
lich as hit is entitild here afore, opynly, that if thay
consent and faver hym, he wold uttirly take upon
hym for to slee the Kyng, lest thurgh his tirannye
and covetise he wold destruy this reume of Scotteland:
and the corone of the land shall be yovon to
Sir Robert Stuard, which is the Kyng's cosyn, and
next of the right of the corone, bot yf the Kyng
had a sune; the same Robert's fadir thenne liggyng
in hostage to the  Kyng of England, for the said
James Kyng of Scottes, yn the towre of  London,
till that his fynaunce were fully content and paid.
And the said Sir Robert's grantesire, the Erle of
Athetelles, of that treison and counsell as hit was
said; and by hymselfe secretly desirid and covetid
to have the corone. For which causes the same
Sir Robert Grame was half the better consentid to
bryng thaire purpos to effecte. For this Sir Robert
Stuard did ever abide yn the Kynges presence, full
famulier aboute hyme at all houres, and most privey
above all other; and was a full gentill squyer, fresh,
lusty, and right amyable. Whome the Kyng entierly
loved as his owne sone; and for the tendure

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000009" N="11"/>

love that he had to hym he made [hym] Constable
of all his host, and … at the sege of Edenbourgh.
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS2">Sic. Roxburgh.</NOTE1></P><P>After this the Kyng sodanly avisid made a
solempne fest of the Cristynmes at Perth, which is
clepid Sant Johns towne, which is from Edenbourgh
on that other side of the Scottesh See, the which
is vulgarly clepid the Water of Lethe. Yn the
myddis of the way thare arose a woman of Yreland,
that clepid herselfe as a suthsayer. The which
anone as she saw the Kyng she cried with lowde
voise, sayng thus, "My Lord Kyng, and ye pase
this water, ye shall never turne ayane on lyve."
The Kyng heryng this was astonyed of her wordis;
for bot a litill to fore he had red yn a prophesie,
that yn the self same yere the Kyng of Scottes
shuld be slayne. And therwithall the Kyng as he
rode clepid to him oone of his knyghtis, and gave
hym yn comaundment to torne ayene to speke with
that woman, and ask of here what sheo wold, and
what thyng sheo ment with her lowd crying? And
sheo began, and told hym as ye hafe hard of the
Kynge of Scottes, yf he passed that water. As
now the Kynge askid her how sheo knew that?
And sheo said that Huthart told her so. "Sire,"
quod ho, "men may calant y tak non hede of yond
womans wordes, for sheo nys bot a drunkine fule,
and wot not what sheo saith." And so with his
folk passid the water, clepid the Scottisshe
See, toward Saynt Johnnes towne, bot iiii myles from the
cuntreth of the Wild Scottes; where, yn a close of

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000010" N="12"/>

Blakfriars withowt the said towne, the Kyng held
a gret fest.</P><P>Where upon a day, as the Kyng plaid at the
chesses with oone of his knyghtis, whome yn playng
wise he clepid Kyng of Love, for he was a lusti
man, full amorous, and much medeled hym with
loves arte. And as hit came the Kyng to mynd
of the prophecie spokyne tofore, the Kyng said to
this knyght, "Sir Kyng of Love," quod he, "hit
is nat" long agone sith I redd a prophecie, spokyne
of tofore, that I saw how that this yere shuld a kyng
be slayne yn this land. And ye wot wele Sir Alexander,
there be no mo kynges yn this reume bot ye
and I; and therfor I cownesell you that ye be well
ware, for I let you wit that I shall ordeyne for my
sure kepyng sufficiently, I trust to God, fo I am
undir youre kynghood and yn the service of Love."
And thus the Kyng yn his solas plaid with the knyght.</P><P>Withyn short tyme after this, the Kyng beyng
in his chambur, talkyng and playng with the lordes,
knyghtis, and squyers, that were abowte hyme, spak
of many dyvers maters. Amonges was ther a squyer
that was right acceptable to the Kyng, that speke,
and said, "For sothe My Lord," quod he, "me
dremed varelye to nyght that Sir Robert Grame
shuld hafe slayne you." And that heryng the Erle
of Orkeney thoo warnyd the squyer, that he shuld
hald his peace, and tell nane such tales yn the Kynges
presence. And therwith the Kyng herying this
squyers dreme, remembred hymselfe how that same
nyght how<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS3">Heo?</NOTE1>  had a sweyvyn slepyng; and semyd

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000011" N="13"/>

to hym varaly that a cruell serpent, and an horribill
tode, assailid hym furiously yn his kynges-chambur.
and how he was sore afright and aferd of hym, and
that he had nothyng whetwith he myght socoure
and defend hymselfe, bot oonly a paire of tanges
that studyn yn the chymneth.</P><P>And many other tokyns, and tailes, liche to this,
the which now may well be demyd by varay demonstracions,
and also pronosticacions to the Kyng, of
his deth and murdur, had he or the tyme of his
deth fell. Also oone of kynges traitours, clepid
Cristofere Chawmebur, that was a squyer of the
Dukes hous of Albayne, iiii times he drugh hym to
the Kynges presence, for he wold haf playnely
opynd, and told hym of the purpos of all the traitours,
that wer aboute to murdure hyme, bycause
that the Kyng withowt any cause hatid hym rightfully.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS4">This,
and several other sentences, are most obscurely expressed.</NOTE1>
And thus, as hit is said by the old wise
fadirs, many years or we were borne, what thyng
that destyned to a person, be hit late be hit sone,
at the last ever hit cumyth.</P><P>Thus, after this, cane fast apporoch the nyght,
yn the which the said James Stward kyng of Scottes
shuld falsely hym unwittyng, suffure his horribill
deth by murdure; this which is pite that any gentill
or gode man to thynk upon. So both afore
soper, and long aftire ynto quarter of the nyght,
in the which the Erle of Athetelles, and Robert
Stward, were aboute the Kyng; where thay wer
occupied att the playng of the chesse, att the tables,

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000012" N="14"/>

yn redyng of Romans, yn syngyng, and pypyng,
yn harpyng; and in other honest solaces, of grete
pleasance and disport. Therwith came the said
woman of Yreland, that clepid herself a dyvenourese,
and entred the Kynges courte, till that she
came streght to the Kynges chambur dore, where
sheo stood, and abode bycause that hit was shitte.
And fast sheo knokyd till at the last the ussher
opynd the dure; marvelyng of that woman's beyng
there that tyme of the nyght, and askyng here what
sheo wold? "Let me yn Sire," quod sheo, "for
I hal sumwhat to say, and to tell unto the Kyng;
for I am the same woman that noght long agone
desirid to haf spokyn with hym, at the Lithe, whan
he shuld passe the Scottish See." The ussher went
yn, and told hym of this woman. "Yea," quod
the Kyng, "let hir cume to morrow:" bycause that
he was occupied with suche disportes at that tyme,
hym lit not to entend her as  thenne. The ussher
came ayane to thee chamber dore, to the said woman;
and there he told hit that the Kyng was besye in
playng; and bid her cum soo ayane upon the morow.
"Well," said the woman, "hit shall repent
yow all, that ye wil nat let me speke nowe with the
Kyng." Therat the ussher lughe, and held her bot
a fule, chargyng her to go her way. And therwithall
sheo went thens.</P><P>Withyn an owre the Kyng askid the voidee, and
drank, the travers yn the chambure edraw, and
every man depairtid and went to rist.  Then Robert
Stward, that was right famylier with the Kyng,
and had all his commandementes yn the chamber,
was the last that departid; and he knewe well the

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000013" N="15"/>

false purveid treison, and was consentid therto, and
therfore left the Kynges chamburs doore opyne;
and had brussed and blundird the lokes of hem, yn
such wise that no man myght shute hem. And
abowt mydnyght he laid certayne plaunches, and
hurdelles, over the diches of the diche that environd
the gardyne of the chambure, upon which the said
traitours entred. That is to say the forsaid Sir
Robert Grame, with other of his covyne ynto the
nowmbre of Thre Hundreth persons; the Kyng
that same tyme ther stondyng in his nyght gowne,
all unclothid save his shirt, his cape, his combe, his
coverchif, his furrid pynsons<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS5">Slippers.</NOTE1> upon the forme, and
the foote sheet; so stondyng afor the chymney
playng with the Qwene, and other ladis and gentilwomen with
here; cast offe his nyght gowne, for
to have gone to bedd.</P><P>But he harkynd, and hard grete noise without,
and grete clateryng of harnych, and men armyd,
with grete sight of torches.  Than he remembred
hym, and ymagynd anone that hit shuld be [the]
false tratours knyght, his deedy enemy, Sir Robert
Grame. And sodenly the Qwene, with all the other
ladis and gentilwomen, rane to the chawmber dure,
and fonde hit opyne; and thay wold have shitt hit,
bot the lokes wer so blundrid, that thay nethir cowth
ne myght shut hit. The Kyng prayd hem to kepe
the same dore as wele as thay myght, and he wold
do all his myght to kepe hym to withstond the false
malice of his traitours and enmys; he suppoisyng
to have brestyn the farrements of the chaumbur

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000014" N="16"/>

wyndos, bot thay wer so sqware, and strongli sowdid
yn the stonys with moltyne lede, that thay
myght not be brostyne for hym, withowtyn more
and strenger helpe.  For which cause he was ugly
astonyd, and in hys mynd kouth thynk on none
other socoure, bot start to the chymney, and toke
the tonges of yren that men rightid the fire with,
yn tyme of neede; and undir his fete he myghtily
brest up a plaunch of the chambur flore, and therwithall
cuverid hym ayane, and entred adowne lowe
beneth amongis th' ordure of the privay, that was
all of hard stone, and none wyndow ne isshue therupon,
save a litill square hole, even at the side of the
bothum of the pryvay, that at the makyng therof
old tyme was levid opyne to clense and ferme the
said privay. By the which the Kyng myght well
escapid; bot he maid to let stop hit well iii dayes
afore hard with stone, bicause that whane he playd
there at the pawme, the ballis that he plaid withe
oft ranne yn at that fowle hole, for ther was ordenyd
withowt a faire playng place for the Kyng.</P><P>And so ther for the Kyng nether reschows, ne
remedie, bot ther he must abide, ellas the while!
The traitours withowt laid at the chaumbur dors,
and at the privay dore also, with wawis, with levours,
and with axes, that at the last thay brak up
all, and entred, (bycause the durs were not fast
shutte,) with swerdes, axis, glavis, billes, and other
terribill and ferefull wepons. Amonges the grete
prese of the which traitours, ther was a faire lady
sore hurt yn the bak; and other gentilwemen hurt
and sore wondid. With the which the ladis, and
all the wemen, mayd a sorowfull skrye, and rane

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000015" N="17"/>

away for the hidos fere of tho boistous and merciles
men of armes. The traitours furiously passed forth
ynto the chaumbures, and founde the Qwene so
dismaid and abassid of that horribill and  ferfull
guvernance, that she cowth nether speke, ne withdrawe
here. And as sho stode ther so astonyd, as
a cryature that had lost here kyndly reasone, oone
of the traitours wowndid here full vilanysly, and
wold have slayne here, ne had not bene oone of Sir
Robert Grame's sones, that thus spek to hym and
said, "What woll ye dow, for shame of youre selfe!
to the Qwene? Sheo is bot a womane. Let us go
and sech the Kyng." And then not wityng wele
what sheo did, or shuld do, for that ferfull and
terribill affray, fledd yn hir kirtill, her mantell
hangyng aboute hir; the other ladyes yn a corner
of the chaumbur, cryyng and wepyng, all destraite
made a pitous and lamentable noyse with full hevy
lokyng and chere.</P><P>And ther the traitours sought the Kyng yn all
the chaumbur abowte, yn the withdrawyng chaumburs,
yn the litters, undir the presses, the fourmes,
the chares, and all other places, bot long they besily
sought the Kyng. Bot they couth nat fynd hym,
for they nether knew ne remembred the privay.
The Kyng heryng of long tyme no noyse, ne stiryng of
the traitours, wende and demyd that thay
had all begone, cryed to the wemen that they shuld
cume with shettes, and drawe hym up owt of that
uncleyne place of the privay. The wemen at his
callyng came fast to the pryvay dore, that was nat
shutt, and so tha opynd hit with labure. And as
they were abowteward to helpe upe the Kyng, oone

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000016" N="18"/>

of the ladis, clepid Elizabeth Douglas, fell ynto the
pryvay to the Kyng. Therwith oone of the said
traitours, called Robert<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS6">Sic.</NOTE1> Chaumbur, suppoisid
varaly sith thay couth nat fynd, yn none of all the
sayd chaumburs, the Kyng, that he of nessessite
had hyd hym yn the pryvay. And therefore he
said to his felawes, "Sirs," quod he, "wherto stond
we thus idill, and lese owre tyme, as for the cause
that we be cumne forehid ? Cumith on furth with
me, and I shall redily tell you wher the Kyng is."
For the said Thomas<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS7">Sic.</NOTE1> Chaumbur had bene afore
right familier with the Kyng yn all places; and
therfore knewe he wele all the pryvay corners of
thoo chaumburs. And so he went forth streght to
the same pryray where the Kyng was, and persavyd
wele an sawe how a plaunch of the flure was brokyn
up, and lift hit up, and with a torch lokyd ynne,
and saw the Kyng ther, and a woman with hyme.
Sayng to his felows, "Sirs the spows is foundon,
wherfore we bene cumne, and all this nyght haf
carold here." Therwithall oone of the said tirantes
and traitours, clepid Sir John Hall, descendid
downe to the Kyng, with a grete knyf yn his hand;
and the Kyng, dowtyng hym sore of his lif, kaught
hym myghtily by the shuldurs, and with full grete
violence cast hym under his fete. For the Kyng
was, of his parsone and stature, a mane right manly
strong. And seyyng another of that Hallis brethyrne
that the Kyng had the betture of hym, went
downe ynto the pryvay also, for to destroy the
Kyng. And anone as he was ther descendid, the

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000017" N="19"/>

Kyng kaught hym manly by the nek, and cast hym
above that other; and so he defowlid hem both undir
hyme, that all a long moneth after men myght
see how strongly the Kyng had holdyn hem by the
throtes. And gretely the Kyng strogild with hem,
for to have berevyd thame thare knyvys; by the
which labur his handis wer all forkute. Bot and
the Kyng had bene yn any wise armyd, he myght
well have escapid thare malice, by the lengthe of
his fightyng with thoo ii false traitour. For yf the
Kyng myght any while lengar have savyd hymselfe,
his servantes, and much other peple of the towne,
by sume fortune shuld haf had sume knawelege
therof, and soo haf cumne to his socoure helpe.
Bot, ellas the while, hit wol not be! Fortune was
to hym adverse, as yn preserwyng of his life any
longer.</P><P>Therwithall that odyus and false traitour Sir
Robert Grame, seyng the Kyng labord so sore with
thoo two false traitours, which he had cast undir
his fete, and that he wer faynt and wery, and that
he was weponelese, the more pite was, descenden
downe also ynto the pryvey to the Kyng, with an
horribill and mortall wepone yn his hand. And
then the Kyng cried hym mercy. "Thow cruell
tirant," quod Grame to hym, "thou hadest nevyr
mercy of lordes borne of thy blode, ne of non other
gentilman, that came yn thy dawnger. Therfor
no mercy shalt thow have here." Thane said the
Kyng, "I besech the that, for the salvacion of my
soule, ye woll let me have a confessore." Quod
the said Grame, "Thow shalt never have other
confessore bot this same swerd." And therwithall

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000018" N="20"/>

he smote hym thorogh the body, and therwithall
the goode kyng fell downe, and lamentablé with a
pitous voyce he cried him oft mercy, and behight
to gyf hym half hys kyngdam, and much other
good, to save his lif. And then the said Grame,
seyng his Kyng and Soveran Lord ynfortuned with
so much deseyse, angwesh, and sorowe, wold hafe
so levyd, and done hym no more harme. The other
traitors above, perceyvyng that, sayd onto the sayd
Sir Robert, "We behote the faithfully, bot yf thow
sle hym, or thow depart, thow shalt dye for hym
on owre handys sone dowtlese." And then the said
Sir Robert, with the other two that descendid first
downe, fell upon that noble prynce, and yn full
horribill and cruell wise they murdrid hym. Ellas
for sorow, that so ynmesurably cruelte and vengance
shuld be done to that worthy prynce, fer hit
was reportid by true persons that sawe hym dede,
that he had sixtene dedely woundes yn his breste,
withowtyn many and other y dyverse places of his
body.</P><P>And hit is rehersid and remembred, yn the historiall
and trewe cronicles of Scotteland, that yn
the self same place, by old tyme passed, there haf
bene iii kynges of Scottes slayne.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS8">A fable. Not

Perth. <HI1 REND="i">Pink.</HI1></NOTE1></P><P>And whene this abhominable and horrible homycidie,
and false treason of this cruell murdur, was
thus done, the said traitours sought the Qwene;
and yn thare furous cruelrye wold hafe slayne her,
yn the same wise. Bot God, of his grace and goodnes,

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000019" N="21"/>

preservyd and kepe here owt of thare handis.
And upon this the noise arose, and sprang owt,
both ynto the courte, and ynto the towne, of that
horribill doyng and faite, of that at the said traitours
hadde done. And anone forthwith all the
Kynges servantes, that were logid yn his said court,
and all the other peple of the same towne, with
oone will and oone assent, as the Kynges trewe
men, and his liege subjectes, comone with force and
armes, with many a torch, and other lightis, and
approched the Kynges court. And whene the traitours hard

thay with all hast possibill fled. Bot yit yn thare
withdrawyng, or thaye were fully passed the diches
of the Kynges place, a worthy knyght that was
called Sir Davy Dunbarre, he allone, ascried and
pursued hem, and with his owne hand sloghe oone
of hem, and another he sore woundid. And as he faught
with them yn thaire fleyng, thay kut of thre
of his fyngurs of his oone hand, and sore woundid
hym upon his hed. And thay slogh an other yong
mane of the Kyngys chaumbur, that was good
grome.</P><P>And yn this wyse Sir Robert Grame, with all
the other traitours, escapid, and droghe hem to the
cuntreth of the Wild Scottes. And thay said amonges
hemselfe, "Ellas why sloghe we not the
Qwene also; for and we had so done we shuld have
bene out of muche disease, and trobill, which we
bene now lich to have. With here we have cause
gretely to drede here, lest sheo woll pursue, and
laboure for to do vengance upon hus." And soth
hit was the Qwene did suche diligence and pursuet,

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000020" N="22"/>

ayanst the said felonouce traitours, that withyne a
moneth next aftir that so abhomynable murdure,
thay were all takyn, and byhedid at Edynburghe.
The Qwene did herselfe grete worship for here trew
acquitable. Hit hath not oft beene sene, so sodeynly
vengaunce takyn upon so horribill and a cruell
ded.</P><P>For furst was takyn Sir Robert Stuard, and
Cristofere Chaumbur, and lad ynto strong prisone
withyne the Castell of Edynburgh; and after by
the sentance of the law they were drawne, and
hangid, and quarterd. Furst ther was ordeynd a
cart, wherupon was set a crose of grete heght, that
was maid of tree. To the which crosse the said
Robert Stuward was fast boundon, stondyng upright
all nakid, boundon to the bak of the same,
nothyng upon hem bot thare pryvay clothes. The
hongman there stondyng above with hem, havyng
in his handis a paire sharpe tangis, with the which
he twitched and all to tare thare skynne and flessh,
that the blode yn full grete quantite ranne downe
from hem, that pite was to see. For they suffird
paciently all the cruell paynes of turmentrye, that
they put hem to; and said unto the said hongman,
"Dowe whatever ye will, for we bene gilti, and haf
well deservyd hit this payneful deth, and inwyse,
and muche more."  And thus wer thay ladd,
pynched and payned, by all the stretes, and thorowe
oute Edynburgh. At the last thay lad on hegh,
afore the Counecell-hows, clepid the Gildhall, there
abydyng an oure and more, that all the peple myght
behold and wondir on hem. After that they were
drawin with horsses, all the towne, till thay cam till

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000021" N="23"/>

a place wher was set ane heghe ynstrument of tymbire,
upon which balastriars and bowyers usyn to
hong thare harnysshid bowes to drie ayanst the
sunne. Where the sayde hongman toke a rope,
and knyt hit fast aboute thare birstes, undre thaire
harmeholes, and drew hem to the heghest place of
that ynstrument; and they there so hongyng confessid
opunly to all the warld all the conspiration
of the Kynges dethe, from poynt to poynt.  And
from theise thay were caried ynto the middis of the
marketh place there, where was ordyned an hie
skaffald, upon which with an old rusty axe the said
hongman smot of thare hedes, and there quartard
hem. And yn this wyse was exsecucion done upon
hem bothe, and thare heddes set upe of the gates
of Sent Johannes Towne.</P><P>Soone after this was takyn the Erle of Athetelles,
by the Erle of Angwis; and laid ynto the castell
of Edenburghe to prisone. This same Erle of Athetelles
was endited, arreyned, and dampned. Bot
bycause of that this was nighe the fest of Pascue,
the crosse was takyn adowne; and he lad to the
polour yn the towne, and ther was he fast boundon,
and a corone of papir put upon his hed, the which
was all abowte depaynetid with jubettes, and for
the more dispite and shame to hym was writyne
with thes wordes, TRAITOUR, TRAITOUR, TRAITOUR.
The Busshope of Urbinate, legate of owre
Holy Fadir the Pope, then beyng in Scotteland,
upon his ambassite, hard thare confessions. And
then evyn forthwith the said Erle of Athetelles was
heded; bot he went alwas to have grace and pardon,
unto the tyme that the hangman had hym

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000022" N="24"/>

upon the skaffald, to be there and then hedid. For
he confessid, and said that he was not yn no wyse
consentyng ne assentyng to the Kynges deth; but
that he knew therof long, and kepte hit counesell,
bycause that Sir Robert Stuward, that was oone of
the grettest traitours, was his sonnes sonne, and
therfore he told hit not to the Kyng. Bot yit nevyre
the lesse when this Sir Robert wist therof and
told hit to the Erle of Athetelles of the Kynges
deth, he blamyd hyme sore, and defendid hym that
in no wyse shuld he be consentyng to none such
murdure of his Soveran Lord: weynyng veraly that
nether he, ne none of all the other, the which bene
rehersid afore, wold never have done that murdure
yn effecte. And so the said Erle told, and confessid,
at his lyvys end; and his hed, coroned with
a corone of yryne, stondyng upon a spere shaft yn
the myddis of Edenburghe.</P><P>After this Sir Robert Grame, with many other
traitours of his coveene, beyng in captyvyte, were
ladde to the towne of Strivellen, and there were
thay tourmented and put to the deth. The said
Sir Robert Grame stondyng there, at the wher he
was tofore enditid of treison afore the Justice and
the lawe there, upon his araynment, said playnely
that thay had no lawe to do hym to deth, for he
said he had nat offendit, bot slayne the Kyng his
dedely enmye; for by his letturs, sealed with his
seale of armes, long tyme afore he had defyed the
Kyng, and renouncid his legeaunce, for causes
reasonables as he said. And yf thay wold do hym
lawe after the statuytes of armes, thay shuld delyver
hym, and let hym go qwite, bicause the Kyng

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000023" N="25"/>

wold have destruyd hym yf he had myght. And
thus yn that he said he did no wrong nor synne,
bot oonly that he sloughe Godes criature, his enemye.
All thes reasons nether couth ne myght suffice for
his excuse, the which he perceyvyd wele yn
all wise of thare wirchynges. This same Sir Robert
Grame, with manly hart and wele avisid, as a mane
wele ynstructe yn lawe and letture, said thes wordes
standyng at the bare afor the Juges, all the peple
there assembled for that cause the selfe tyme. "O
ye all so synfull, wreched, and mercilese Scottisshe
folke, withoute prudens, and full replet of unavisid
folie, I know wele that I shall nowe dye, and ma
note escape youre venomous judiciall handes; for
by will, and not be right ne lawe, ye have dampned
my bodye to the dethe, the which God suffrethe
me at this tyme to resave of you, for no desairt of
this accusacion that ye condempne me ynne nowe,
bot for other offences and trespas, that I yn the
vayne tymes of my youth have displeasid hyme
ynne. Yit doubt y nat that ye shall se the daye
and the tyme, that ye shall pray my soule, for
the grete good that I have done to you, and to all
this reaume of Scottland, that I have thus slayne
and delyveryd you of so cruell a tirant, the grettest
enemye the Scottes or Scottland myghth have, consideryng
his unstaunchable covetise, yn his youth,
ayenst all nature, his tirannye ynmesurable, without
pite or mercy to sibbe or to freme, to hie or to
lawe, to poure or to riche."</P><P>All thes thynges the said Sir Robert Grame,
with many other ynconvenyences, he rehersid there
ayanst the Kyng; the whiche rehersale wole be

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000024" N="26"/>

ynne Scotteland many a yere here after. For he
was a mane of grete hart and manhode, and full
discrete, and a grete legister of lawe positive, and
canone, and civile bothe. Yit for all that, at the
last he was dampned there by the Juges of the deth.
This was the sentance of the jugesment there shuld
be brought a cart, yn the mydward of the whiche
there shuld be sette fast a tree uperight, longer then
a mane, and with that same knyf that he sloughe
the Kyng withall, was his hand all upon heghe nalid
fast to that tree, and so was he had thorough oute
the towne.  That edoone the hangmane was commandid,
with that same knyfe,  to kut of that hand
frome the arme. After that he was nalid nakynd,
as he was first borne of his modir, drawen thurghe
the towne withowte coerture of any parte of his
body, as nature brought hym forth from his modirs
wombe, and yn the same  wise ladd thorgh all the
stretes of that towne; and the tourmentours on every
side hym, withe hookid ynstrumentes of yryne,
fuyre hote all red glowyng, thay pynchid and
twynched his theghis, his legges, his armes, his
sides, his bake, his shuldurs, his neke, his wombe,
and over all his body, that was full seke and pitous
to loke upon, wher thay suppoisid most to anoye
hyme and greve, that hit was to any mans kynd to
sorofull and pitous sight, and to abhomynable to se.
With the ymportible payne of turment, he cried
then pitously withe dedely voice, for the panys and
pasions that he so suffird, sayng to them that thay
did that durise to hym ayenst the lawe; "this that
ye done to me is oonly by rigoure of ynmesurable
tyrannye All the warld may clepe you Scottes

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000025" N="26"/>

tirantes, for manekynd may not withe the lif suffur
ne yndure the paynefull and tiranuous tourmentrye
that ye put me unto. I doute me full sore that,
and ye contynue thus your tourmentes upon my
wretched person,  that for the payne ye will
constrayne me to denye my Creature. And yf I so
doo I appell you afor God, the Hie and Chyf Juge
of all manekynde after there desertes at the unyversal
dome, that ye bene the varay cause of the
losse of my saule."</P><P>Thurghe the whiche speche some of the Lordes,
so abidyng upon the execucion of this said  Sir
Robert Grame, moevid of pite let tak him doune.
And as he was all nakyd lappid yn  a rough Scottisshe
mantell and cast hym ayane,  with a grete
violence, ynto sore and full hard prisone.</P><P>In the meane tyme many of the  other traitours
were boweld all qwik, and afterward were quarterd,
as wele thay that receyvid the said Sir Robert, as
thay that were with hym. Whane the exsecution
of the said traison was done, and many  of tha that
were with hym att the day of the Kyng confessid
whane thay were spokyne to go with the said Sir
Robert Grame, hit was not told unto hym of no
purpos that was takyn for to destruye the Kyng,
and put hym to dethe;  bot hit was said unto hem
that thay shuld go with hym, to ravisshe a faire
lady oute of the Kynges house, whame the said Sir
Robert Stuward shuld have weddid the next day
folowyng.</P><P>And after this thay ladd aftsounes the said Sir
Robert Grame to the place where he shuld dye.
And sodeynely thay droughe away the mantall, to

<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000026" N="28"/>

the which all his woundes were hardyned, and clave
fast with his blode dried therto; forwith the said
payne he fele downe yn a swonyng, and so lay along
on the ground more than a  quarter of an owre.
And then he revivid, and qwykynd ayane, seyng
that ryvyng away so sodeinly  and rudely of that
mantell was to hym gretter payne than any other
that [he] had suffird afore. And after this, for the
more grefe and sorow to hyme, thay boweld his
sonne all quyke, and quarterd hym afor his eene,
and drewe owt his hart of his  body: the which
harte lepe thrise more than a fote of heghte, after
hit was drawen owte of his body: and yn semblable wise
the hangmane droughe  owte all his bowelles, and quarterd hym,
and many other moo after hyme.</P><P>Bot the last of all Thomas Halle was hedid; for
as hit was knawen and veraly wist by proof he was
the pryncipall and the fynell cause of the Kynges
deth. The sayd Chaumbur had the strengyst hart
of all the other,  for he never repentid hym of the
