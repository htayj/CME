I resolved to print it as a specimen of the curious fancies our forefathers believed in (as I suppose) in Natural Science, to go alongside of the equally curious notions they put faith in in matters religious.  And this I determined on with no idea of scoffing, or pride in modern wisdom; for I believe that as great fallacies now prevail in both the great branches of knowledge and feeling mentioned, as ever were held by man.  Because once held by other men, and specially by older Englishmen, these fancies and notions have, or should have, an interest for all of us; and in this belief, one of them is presented here.</P><P>The loss of my sweet, bright, only child, Eena, and other distress, have prevented my getting up any cram on the subject of Quintessence to form a regular Preface.  The (translated?) original of the text is attributed to Hermes—Trismegistus, "or the thrice great Interpreter," so called as "having three parts of the Philosophy of the whole world"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1"><HI1 REND="i">The Mirror of Alchimy,</HI1> composed by the thrice-famous and learned Fryer, Roger Bachon, 1597.</NOTE1>—to whom were credited more works than he wrote.  The tract appears to be a great fuss about Alcohol or Spirits of Wine; how to make it,<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000003" N="vi"/> and get more or less tipsy on it, and what wonders it will work, from making old men young, and dying men well, to killing lice.</P><P>The reading of the proof with the MS. was done by Mr. Edmund Brock, the Society's most careful and able helper. To Mr. Cockayne I am indebted for the identification of some names of plants, &amp;c.;; and to Mr. Gill of University College, London, for some Notes on the Chemistry of the treatise, made at the request of my friend Mr. Moreshwar Atmaram.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS2">Mr. M.

Then follows a description of the distilling apparatus, which seems to have been arranged to ensure a very slow distillation, so as to obtain a product as colourless and scentless as possible.</P><P>P. 5. The second way to make the Quinte essence depends on distillation of alcohol by means of the heat of fermenting horse-dung; also the fifth manner.</P><P>P. 6. The directions for gilding burning water are all nonsense; but as the writer had no means of testing the truth of his statements, they may have been made in good faith.</P><P>P. 7. The idea which he expresses, that this gilt burning water will make you well and young, is difficult to explain, except on the assumption that, it being the strongest of alcohol, a very little served to produce that elevation of spirits which seemed to bring back the spring of youth.</P><P>P. 7, 1. 6 from the bottom.  The word <HI1 REND="i">liquibles</HI1> in the text does not mean liquids, for a liquid cannot be made hot enough to be <HI1 REND="i">quenched.</HI1>  If<EPB/><PB SEQ="00000033" N="28"/> the original <HI1 REND="i">liquibles</HI1> cannot be retained I should substitute the word <HI1 REND="i">liquiables</HI1>, meaning those things which can be liquefied by heat.  Indeed in the next passage we find stated that if Saturn (the alchemists' mystical name for Lead) be quenched, &amp;c.;, and that if then Mars (Iron) be quenched in the same liquid, it will acquire the softness of Saturn.  Or if you quench lead in spirit which has had iron first cooled in it, it becomes hard.</P><P>Of course there is no truth whatever in the above statements.</P><P>P. 8. The fire without coals, &amp;c.;, is 'corrosive sublimate,' most probably containing an excess of Sulphuric acid (vitriol) as an impurity.  If Copper (Venus) or Tin (Jupiter) be dipt into this solution of mercury they will have a deposit of mercury formed on their surface, which will give them a pearly appearance.</P><P>P. 8. To bring Gold into calx.  When gold is treated in the way directed, a fine powder of gold of a brown or yellow colour is left.  This might readily have been mistaken for a calx by those who had no clear ideas of what calx really was.</P><P>P. 9. The departing of gold from silver is essentially the same as the plan practised at the present day.</P><P>To get the Quintessence of Gold.  I can make nothing of the directions, that is, I cannot see that they (the directions) hide any real truth.</P><P>P. 10. How to get the Quintessence of Antimony.  I can make nothing of this part, and can only suggest that the vinegar used contained hydrochloric acid, and when distilled with 'Myn Antimony' (native sulphide of antimony) gave a distillate of Chloride of Antimony containing some 'kermes' which is red.</P><P>From this point onward there is little or nothing that can be explained by a Chemist.</P></DIV1></BACK><EPB/></TEXT></DLPSTEXTCLASS>
