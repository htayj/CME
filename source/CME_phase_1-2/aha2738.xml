About 1200 Wido of St. Valerie (possibly a younger brother of Bernard) gave Godstow a rent-charge (nos. 16, 17) of 6s. 8d. over these lands to endow an obital service for his father.

The Rev. H. Salter has shown me that Mr. Wigram, following Dugdale, has assigned the sale to the great Reginald (died 1166), whereas the conveyance is dated 'in die Translacionis B. Thome Martiris,' and cannot therefore be earlier than 1224. In 1286, in an exchange of rent-charges over each other's property, Godstow (no. 509) gave up this Knighton rent-charge to St. Frideswyde's priory. The service for the founder's father was provided for by transferring the obligation to Godstow property in North Oxford, where, at the dissolution in 1540, we find this 6s. 8d. still charged (<HI1 REND="i">Monasticon</HI1>, iv. 370). When, some 150 years later, the compiler of the Latin Register transcribed the deeds about the obit, he could not make out the locality. He had recourse to two subterfuges.

<EPB/><PB REF="00000061.tif" SEQ="00000061" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNS" CNF="999" N="43"/> of the Seven Bridges Road (formerly, Botley Causeway) which gave a more convenient access from Oxford across the many-streamed Thames valley to the road to Bath and the west. Before that, the route went north from Oxford through Walton for about a mile; then turned westward; crossed the main Thames at Binsey ford; and thence advanced across various branches of Thames by bridges, whose abutments remained till living memory, to Seukeworth, just south of the branch of Thames which parts Oxfordshire from Berkshire.
There is some confusion about the dates of the de Seukeworth family. Wood, basing his judgement on Brian Twyne's excerpts, assumed that William of Seuke|worth gave the tithe of his mills (no. 25) to Godstow at the foundation, in 1138/9. This cannot be, since the first list in which the grant is mentioned is Henry II's second charter (no. 879), i.e. about 1165. The family descent seems to be—Robert of Seukeworth, about 1140; William, about 1165; Robert, 1200; Sir William, 1230; Dionysia, 1260.
The church (no. 27), or chapel-of-ease, of Seukeworth was a benefaction of the family to Studley Priory in Oxfordshire.
At the dissolution, 1540, Godstow still owned (<HI1 REND="i">Monast</HI1>. iv. 375) a parcel of meadow called Secourt ham, valued at 3s. 4d. a year, and then reckoned to be in Wytham parish.]</P></ARGUMENT><DIV5 NODE="AHA2738.0001.001:4.2.1.7.1" TYPE="deed" N="25"><HEAD><MILESTONE N="VI(18)" UNIT="folio"/>A chartur of William of Sewkeworth of the tythe of ij. myll &amp; oþer commodyteys in ye same.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>About 1165.

Somewhere beyond the village of Wytham, a reservoir seems to have been con|structed to catch one of the springs which gush out of the foot of the Berkshire 
<EPB/><PB REF="00000064.tif" SEQ="00000064" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNS" CNF="999" N="46"/> hills. Mr. H. Hurst points out the difficulty of supposing engineers at that date to be capable of conducting a stream of water under the branches of Thames which lie between Wytham and Godstow. But Oseney Abbey (Wood's <HI1 REND="i">City of Oxford</HI1>, ii. 205) was supplied by a reservoir at North Hincksey, and portions of the lead-pipe (enclosed in stone), by which the water was conveyed across the Thames valley and probably under the streams, have been dug up in modern times. Otho Nicholson's conduit (Wood, i. 441) at Carfax, built in 1610, of which the reservoir|house still stands on the slope of Hincksey hill, is a later and more famous example. Mr. Hurst has drawn my attention to a remarkable work to supply the tanks within the nunnery enclosure and the large fishponds outside. To the west of Godstow there is a small, winding branch of Thames, called 'Wytham brook.' From this, by a straight artificial canal, a stream of water was led along most of the west side of the gardens, parallel to the convent. When near the south-west corner, this canal turned sharply eastwards, was brought under the west wall by a fourteenth|century arch (which still remains), formed within the court two largish baths or ponds, passed through the east wall by an arch, no doubt fed the fishponds (which had one arm 65 yards by 9 yards, another 23 yards by 8 yards, both of about 4 feet deep: all filled up in 1887) which lay just south of the convent; and thence escaped to the Thames by a channel which was filled up in 1885. This was called the 'Sanctuary Stream.' The field enclosed between this stream on the west and the convent buildings on the east is called 'Sanctuary Field'; that west of it is called 'Sentry Field,' probably from memory of the 1645-6 campaigns. At the point where Sanctuary stream leaves Wytham brook, an elm-tree was blown down in 1899. The cattle, trampling over the spot, brought out the foundations of a rectangular building which had no doubt been erected to keep the water in the canal at a just level. Mr. Hurst, who made the discovery, thinks that this is the 'head' described in no. 28. I do not agree, for I cannot find here any 'arable land,' for the crossing of which (nos. 28, 29) permission had to be obtained. I must, how|ever, add that Mr. Hurst opines that the levels of the water round Godstow have been greatly altered, and that lands now meadow may have been formerly plowable.]</NOTE1></DIV6></DIV5><DIV5 NODE="AHA2738.0001.001:4.2.1.8.2" TYPE="subsection" N="2"><HEAD>[Dispute about tithe at Wytham.]</HEAD><DIV6 NODE="AHA2738.0001.001:4.2.1.8.2.1" TYPE="deed" N="31"><HEAD><MILESTONE N="IIIb(15b)" UNIT="folio"/>A chartur I-made by dyuers iuggys a-geynst þ<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> person of wyhtham.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>1244/5, Febr. 13.

And therefore no man dischargeth well his conscience in this point that payeth not duly the tenth of every Lambe, every Calfe, and every other thing titheable.' See also in no. 871.

It is now reckoned as being in the county of Oxford, but part of it was formerly reckoned as being in Berkshire. It represents, therefore, the debateable land where the two kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia pushed each other backwards and forwards, and the land sometimes was in the Wessex see of Salisbury, at other times in the Mercian see of Lincoln. In <HI1 REND="i">Monast</HI1>. vi. 1276 is printed a charter of Henry II conferring on Lincoln Minster 'the church of Langeford and all the land which Roger, bishop of Sarum (died 1139, Dec. 4), held in that vill,' on the petition of Robert (de Chesney), bishop of Lincoln (1147-68). Two prebends, 'Langford ecclesia' and 'Langford manor,' were endowed from this source. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners are now the lay impropriators of the parish. The three earliest of the following deeds belong to the time of that endowment. Unfortunately the record is incomplete, by the excision of the second leaf of this section, a loss which is not made good by the still more mutilated Exchequer MS. It appears that bishop Robert, before conveying the estate to Lincoln Minster, took out a messuage and half a hide of land which he granted, at 12d. yearly quit|rent, to one of his serfs, Jeffrey son of Fowke, and which he had formerly granted to Jeffrey's brother, Robert (probably since deceased). At a later period we find these lands placed under feoffees, as though to found a chantry, but the documents are not brought to a definite conclusion. I have inquired at Langford and found no tradition of Godstow having owned lands there, but a conjecture is hazarded that the chantry may have been connected with a chapel at the celebrated Radcott bridge<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS666">Battle of Radcott bridge, Dec. 20, 1387.</NOTE1> in Langford.]</P></ARGUMENT><DIV5 NODE="AHA2738.0001.001:4.2.9.21.1" TYPE="deed" N="466"><HEAD><MILESTONE N="205" UNIT="folio"/>A ratificacion of the Chapiter of our lady of lyncolne of the forsaid<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS667">Not of the grant in no. 467 (which precedes this in the MS.), but of an earlier one, not here given.</NOTE1> yifte, yoven by the Bisshoppe as is aforesaid.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>About 1150.

The agreement was reached 'in sinodo Oxon,' i. e. the annual meeting of the clergy of the arch|deaconry of Oxford. Rev. H. Salter points out the interesting fact that the monk of Eynsham, in his vision at Easter 1196, saw in mild torments a venerable abbess 'of a neighbouring convent,' who had died 'presenti anno' (April 1195-April 1196). This must be Godstow, since Littlemore and Studley were under prioresses.

Against the identification with Combe Longa is the fact that the manor of Combe Longa was in the King's hands from 1154 on|wards; so that its miller, in making his grant, would have appealed to the King, his overlord, not to the bishop. The extant accounts of the manor (in Public Records Office) are not early enough to help us. Rev. S.
