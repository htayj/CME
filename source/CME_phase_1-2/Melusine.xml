dede / for to couloure our hystory to be trew / as we
hold̛ hit soo / and for to shew &amp; publysshe it thrugh

</P><P>We haue thenne herd̛ say and telle of our auncyents,
that in many partes of the sayd̛ lande of Poytow haue
ben shewed vnto many oon right famylerly many
manyeres of thinges / the whiche somme called Gobelyns /
the other ffayrees, and the other 'bonnes dames' or good
ladyes / and they goo by nyght tyme and entre within
the houses without opnyng or brekyng of ony doore /
and take &amp; bere somtyme with them the children out of
theire cradelles. and somtyme they tourne them out of
theyre wit / and somtyme they brenne &amp; roste them
before þe fyre / and whan they departe fro them, they
leue hem as hoole as they were byfore / and somme gyue
grette happe &amp; ffortune in this world.  And yet haue
I herd̛ say of oon Geruayse, a man worshipfuƚƚ &amp; of
credence, that somme other fauntasyes appyeren by nyght
tyme vnto many oon in dyuerse places, in lyknes of
wymen with old̛ face, of low and lytil stature or body /
whiche dide scoure pannes &amp; potts, and dide suche
thinges as a mayde or seruaunt oughte to doo / lyberaly
&amp; without dooyng of ony harme.  And also he saith
for certayn, that in his tyme he hadd̛ a frend̛ that was
auncyent &amp; old̛, whiche recounted for trouth / that in
hys dayes he hadd̛ seen many tymes suche
thinges. and saith yet the said̛ Geruayse, that the sayd fayrees
toke somtyme the fourme &amp; the fygure of fayre &amp;
yonge wymen / of whiche many men haue hadd̛ som
doughtirs, and haue take to theire wyues by meanes of
som couenauntes or promysses that they made them to

wyse they shuld̛ nat enquyre where they were
bycomme / the other / that yf they had eny children /<EPB/><PB N="5" ID="pb.5"/>

that theire husbandes shuld neuer see them in theyr

covenauntes they had good fortune and were euer in
prosperyte / but assoone as they faylled of theyr promysses
or couenauntes they fell doun <CORR SIC="for">fro</CORR> theyr good happ &amp;
fortune / and aftir these thinges so happed to haue
broken theyr couenauntes / the other were conuerted &amp;
tourned into serpentes.  And yet more sayth the <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="folio"/>said
Geruayse, that he byleueth this to be permytted &amp; doon
for som mysdedes that were doon ayenst the playsure
of god / wherfore he punysshed them so secretly &amp; so
wounderly wherof none hath parfytte knowlege / but
alonely he / and they may be therefore called the
secrets of god, abysmes without ryuage and without
bottom / For none knoweth nothing perfyttly to the
regarde of hym / how be it that sometyme of his
prouysion ben many thinges knowen / not only of oon /
but of many other.  It is seen often whan a man
hath yssued out of hys countree / and hath seen many
awounder &amp; meruayllous thynges whiche he neuer wold
haue byleued hit by here sayeng̘, without he had hadd
the sight of hit / but as for me that haue nat walked
ferre, I haue seen somme thinges that many oon shuld
nat byleue without they sawe it.  With this seyth
the said Geruayse, &amp; setteth fourth an ensaumple of a
knyght, named Sir Robert du Chastel Roussel of the
prouince of Asy / the whiche knight by auenture on an
euen founde oon of the fayree in a medowe / and wold
haue had her to his wyf / and in dede she assentid to
hit / by suche couenaunce that neuer he shuld see her
naked / and were longe togider / and the knight grew
&amp; wexed prosperous fro day to day.  It happed long
tyme after that / that he wold haue seen the said
Nymphe naked / as he dede / in so moche that the
said nymphe putte her heed in to a watre and was<EPB/><PB N="6" ID="pb.6"/>

tourned in to a serpent, whiche was neuer seen after
that / And the knyght fro day to day wexed pouere
and declyned from his prosperyte.  As for prouerbes
&amp; exemples I wil none bryng̘ more vnto you / and
that / that I haue doon / it was bycause þat I suppose
to treate how the noble ffortresse or Castell of
Lusygnen was bylded &amp; made of a woman of the fayree, and
the manyere how / after the juste &amp; true cronykle /
without to applye ne adiouste to it nonething / but that
it be approuued Iuste &amp; trew, and of the propre or owne
matere / And ye shall here me spek &amp; say of the noble
lynee whiche yssued of the said woman / that shall
regne for euer vnto thend of the world / aftir that it
appiereth that it hath euer regned vnto this tyme
present.  But bycause that I byganne first to treate of
the fayree / I shall telle you how &amp; of whens cam
the said woman whiche bilded the noble <MILESTONE N="3b" UNIT="folio"/>ffortress of
Lusygnen, beforsayd./

</P><P>Herafter folowen the names of the estates of the
children whiche yssued of Melusyne, and were
bygoten of Raymondyn in wedlok.  And first yssued
kyng Uryan, whiche regned in Cypre.  Aftir hym
cam King Guyon, which regned myghtily in

</P><P>It is true that there was somtyme in Albany a

&amp; that Mathas whiche was fader to fflorymond was
hys first sone / and this kinge had to name Elynas,
and was right worthy &amp; mighty knight of his land./
And it happed that after the decess of his first wyf / as
he chaced in a fforest nighe to the see, in the which
forest was a moche fayre fontaynne / that sodaynly he
had so grett athurst / that as <CORR SIC="honstreyned">constreyned</CORR> he tourned
&amp; yede toward the said fontaynne.  And whan he
approuched to the said fontayne / he herde a voyce that
song̘ so melodyously &amp; so swetly / that he suposed none

he knewe that hit was the voyce of a woman.  Thenne
descendid he &amp; alyghted fro hys hors to thende he
shulde not make gret affray / and walked fayre &amp; softly
toward the fontayn in the most couered wyse that he
coude.  And whan he camme nygh to the fontayne /
he sawe there the fayrest lady that euer he the dayes
of hys lyf had seen to his aduys or semynge.  Thenne
he stode styl al abasshed of the grett beaulte that he
perceyued in the same ladye, whicℏ euer songe so
melodyously and so swetly.  And thus he stood styl /
asmoche for the bewte of the lady / as for to here her

thende that the said lady shuld not perceyue hym / &amp;
forgate all the chasse and grett thurst that he had
afore.  And byganne to think on the songe &amp; on the beaulte
of the lady.  In so moche that he was as rauysshed
&amp; knew nat yf it was daylight or nyght, ne yf he slept
or wakked̛./

</P><P>Thus as ye shall now here was kynge helynas so
abused / aswel of the right swete songe / as of
the bewte of the said lady that he ne wyst whether he
slept or waked, For euer styl she songe so melodyously
that it was a swete &amp; melodyous thing to here / Thenne<EPB/><PB N="8" ID="pb.8"/>

the kynge Elynas was so rauysshed &amp; abused that he
remembred  of nothinge  worldly / but alonely that he
herd̛ &amp; sawe the said lady, and abode there long tyme.
Thanne camme rannyng toward him two of hys houndis
whiche made to hym grett feste, and he lept &amp; mevyd
hym as a man wakynge from slep / and thenne he
remembred of the chasse, and had of new so grett
athurst / that without hauyng aduys ne mesure he yede
fourth vpon the ryuage of the fountaynne, and toke the
basyn which heng̘ therby &amp; drank of the watre.  And
thenne he beheld the said lady whiche had lefte her
songe &amp; salued her right humbly / beryng vnto her
the gretest honour &amp; reuerence that he might.  Thanne
she that coude &amp; wyst moche of wele &amp; of honour,
rendred to hym his salutacion right gracyously,
'Lady,' said Elynas, the kinge / 'of your curtoysye be
nat you dyspleased yf I requyre of you to knowe of
your estate / of your beyng &amp; what ye are / For the
cause that moueth me therto is suche / as now I shall
reherse to you.  Right dere lady vouche ye saaf to
wete &amp; knowe that I can &amp; know so moche of the
beyng of this countree, that there nys within this
foure or fyue myle neyther Castel ne ffortres, but þat
I knowe / except that same fro whens I departed this
day by the mornyng̘, whiche is two myle hens or
theraboute.  Nor there nys neyther lord ne lady within
this Countrey but that I knowe them wel, and therfore
gretly I meruaylle &amp; wounderly am abasshed, fro whens
may be suche a fayr and so gent a lady as ye be / so
exempt &amp; vnpurveyed of felawship.  and for godis loue
pardonne me / For grette outrage is to me to demande
of you therof / but the grette desire &amp; good wylle that
my herte bereth toward your gracyous personne, hath
caused hardynes within me for to doo it.'/<EPB/><PB N="9" ID="pb.9"/>
</P><P><MILESTONE N="4b" UNIT="folio"/>'Sire Knight,' said the lady / 'there is none outrage /
but it commeth to you of grette curtoysye &amp;
honour.  And knowe you, sire knight, that I shall nat
be longe alone whan it shal playse me / but from me
I haue sent my seruaunts, while þat I dysported me.'
Thenne cam fourth to that word̛ oon of her seruaunts,
wel arayed, whiche rode on a fayre Courcer, and att his
right hand ledd̛ a palfroy so richely enharnashed that
the kyng Elynas was moche abasshed of the grette
richesse &amp; noble aray that was about the said palfray.
Thanne said the seruaunt to his lady: 'Madame, it is
tyme whan it shall playse you to comme.'  And she
fourthwith said to the kinge:  'Sire knight, god be
with you, and gramercy of your curtoisye.' thenne she
went toward the palfray / and the kinge hyed hym,
&amp; helped to sette her on horsbak moche prately.
And she thanked hym moche of hit, and departid /.
And the kyng yede to his hors, and lept on his bake.
thanne camme hys meney, whiche sought hym, and
sayd that they had taken the herte.  And the king̘
said to them / 'that playseth me.'  Thenne he byganne
to thinke on the beaulte of the said lady, and so moche
he was surprysed of her loue, that he ne wyst what
contenaunce or manyere he shuld hold / and said to
his meyne / 'goo you alle before / and I shall folow
you soone.'  They yede at hys commandement theire
way / and wel they perceyued &amp; knew that he hadd̛
found som thinge / And the king hastly tourned his
hors, &amp; toke the way that the said lady had ytaken / &amp;
folowed her.

</P><P>Thystory recounteth to vs, that so long folowed the
kinge Elynas the lady, that he found her in a
fforest, where as were many trees high &amp; strayt / and
[it] was in the season that the tyme is swete &amp;<EPB/><PB N="10" ID="pb.10"/>

gracyous, &amp; the place within the forest was moche
delectable.  And whan the lady herde the noyse
of the hors of the kynge Elynas, that rode fast, she
said to her seruaunt: 'Stand we styl, and late vs
abyde this knight, For I byleue that he cometh vnto
vs for to telle to vs a part of his wille, wherof he was
nat as tofore aduysed, For we sawe hym lepe on his
hors all thoughtfuƚƚ.'  'Madame,' said the seruaunt /
'at your plaisure.'  Thanne camme the kinge nigh vnto
the lady / and as he had neuer seen her before, he
salewed her, moche affrayenge, For he was so
surprysed of her loue that he coude nat holde
contenaunce.  Thanne the lady, that knew ynoughe as it
was, and that <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="folio"/>she shuld comme to her entrepryse /
said to hym: 'Kynge Elynas, what goost thou sechyng̘
aftir so hastly / haue I oughte borne away of thyn

was moche abasshed, For he knew nat what she was
that spak with hym / and neuertheles he ansuerde to
her: 'My dere lady, nought of myn owne ye withbere /
but only that ye passe &amp; goo thrugh my land / and it
is grett shame to me / sith that ye be astraunger, that
I ne doo you to be conueyed worshipfully thrugh my

ansuerde the lady:  'Kynge Elynas, I hold you for
escused, &amp; pray you yf ye wyl of vs none other thinge /
that ye leue ne lette nat your retourne for that cause.'
And Elynas ansuerde / 'wel other thing̘ I seke,

hardyly.'  'My right dere lady, sith that it is your

I desire moche more than eny other thing̘ in the
world forto haue your good loue &amp; your good grace.'
'By my feith,' said she, 'kyng Elynas, to that haue ye<EPB/><PB N="11" ID="pb.11"/>

not faylled / yf that ye think theron but wele &amp;
honour, For neuer man shal haue my loue in hys

lady þat he was esprised of her loue, &amp; said to hym /
'yf ye wil take me as your wyf by mariage, and be

and with good wille, sware &amp; promysed to hold that
byfore is said.  Without longe rehercyng they were
spoused, &amp; ledd̛ longe a good lyf togidre.  But al the
land of the kinge Elynas was moche abasshed who was
this lady / how be it that she gouerned her wel right
wysly &amp; valiauntly.  But Nathas, that was sone to the
kynge Elynas, hated her ouermoche.  and [it] happed
that she was at her childbed of thre doughtirs / the

Melyor, and the iijde.  Palatyne.  The kynge Elynas
was nat thanne present at that place, but kynge Nathas
his sone was there, and beheld hys thre sustirs, that
were so fayre that it was meruaylle.  and thanne he
went toward the kinge his fader / and thus he said to
hym: 'Sire / Madame, the quene Pressyne your wyf,
hath made &amp; is delyuered of thre doughtirs, the most
fayre that euer were seen / comme &amp; see them.'  Thenne
kinge Helynas, that remembred nat of the promysse
that he had made to Pressyne his wyf / sayd / 'ffayre

And wel I wot that thy sone Nathas is cause therof,

may none otherwise be, / and that I see your playsire
is that I gyue name to it, hit shalbe called after myn

'the name setteth full wel to it for two causes, First
bycause ye are called Melusyne of Albanye, whiche

Thenne ansuerd Raymondyn, 'there nys nothing that

For wel I considere &amp; see that all your werkes ne

'it is wel rayson, sith that all your trust ye putte on
me that I hold to you trouth.  It is trouth that your
fader, by hys predecessors, oweth to haue many grete
thinges in bretayne, the whiche shulle be declared unto
you whan ye be there.  It muste thanne be by you

he was in Bretayn for hys worthynes, grete policye &amp;
valiauntnes, and as he that drad no man that owed hym
euyl wyƚƚ he was moche loued with the kinge there /
in so moche that the said kynge made hym hys
Seneschall &amp; Captayn general ouer alle his men of

child begoten of his body he had.  Whyche nevew, by
the introduction of som, had grete enuye on Henry,
your fader.  For to <MILESTONE N="38b" UNIT="folio"/>hym they said in this manere:
"Ha! Ha! right-full heyre of Breytayne.  Woo is us to
see your grete domage / that is / you to be putte doun

þey poyntyng you with the fynger shal sey, Loo,
yonder is the fole that for his feynted herte hath be
putte out of so noble enherytaunce as is the royame of
Bretayne."  And whan he understode the said enjurous
wordes, he said: "Who is he that dare vsurpe &amp; take
fro me my right, I knowe none / but that god wyl
haue me to be punysshed. and wel I wot, þat the
kinge, my lord &amp; oncle, wyl not take ony other to be

hym: "By my feyth, ye are [not] enfourmed in this
matere, For the kinge, your oncle, hath made &amp;
ordeyned hys heyre, Henry of Leon, and as now
letters of graunt ben therof made."  Whan the yong man
herd these wordes, he as wood wroth ansuerd to them,
"wete it for certeyn / that if I knew these wordes to
be trew, I shuld putte hastly remedy thereto / in so
moche that neuer he shold hold land ne no possession."
And thenne ansuerde to hym a knight named Josselyn
Dupont: "certaynly it is soo / and for we wold haue
none other to be kynge in brytaynne but you, after the
decees of þe kinge, we warne you therof.  For this
hath the kyng your oncle doon secretly, for ye shuld

They toke theyre leue, For they rought not for no

your faders deth.  For enuyous and wroth they were
that the kinge louyd hym so wel, and for nought sette
they were by hym.  knowe ye muste, that on the

squyers, rode fourth so long on hys way, tyl they
came in Brut Brytayne, wher the peuple was abasshed
&amp; moche wondred what suche grete nombre of
straungers wold haue.  But for they payed wel &amp;
largely for that they toke, they were ensured that they
wold &amp; sought but good.  For thauncyent knight of
the meyne of Melusyne rewled and gyded them alle
in aƚƚ honour &amp; goodnes.  And for they were not so
vnpurueyed / but that with them they had armures,
with them yf nede were to arme them with / the
kinge that knew of it, sent to them to wete what they<EPB/><PB N="69" ID="pb.69"/>

sought, whiche message demanded of Raymondyn yf hee
owed euyl wyƚƚ to the kyng &amp; to hys royame.  In this
messagery or embassade were sent two wyse knightes,
whiche wysly enquered of Raymondyn as byfore is
sayd what he sought and what he wold. to whome
Raymondin full curtoysly ansuered thus. 'Fayre
lordes, ye shaƚƚ teƚƚ to my liege that I come but<MILESTONE N="40b" UNIT="folio"/> for
good and wele, and for to haue the lawful right in
hys Court of suche thinges as belongen to me, For the

'Forsouth,' ansuerd the two knyghtes, 'ye shalbe welcome
whan it shal playse you to do soo. and wete it wel that
the kynge, our liege, is rightwyse &amp; juste / and nothing
as fer as right requyreth shal not be by hym denyed
by ony wyse. but telle vs yf it lyke you whither ye
are now bounde.'  'Certaynly,' said Raymondyn, 'I
wold I were at Quyngant.'  Thanne answerd one of
them, 'ye are wel on the way toward it, and wete that
ye shall fynd there Aleyn of Leon, whiche shaƚƚ make
you good chere.  and also ye shaƚƚ fynd there two
knightes, men of wele and honour, and hold strayte
this way and ye shal not mys of it, and with your leue
we retourne on our way toward oure liege.'

</P><P>Whanne these two knightes were fer fro
Raymondyn and hys felawship an halfmyle, they
byganne to say one to other: 'By my feyth, yonder
are gentyl and curtoys folkes, worshipfuƚƚ &amp;
honourable.  For certayn they come not into this land
without it is for some grete matere.'  and yet sayd, 'lete
vs go thrugh Quyngan; and to aleyn we shaƚƚ anounce
theyre commyng.'  they toke the way toward it, and
rode so fast that soone they came there where they
found Alayn, to whome they said &amp; announced the
commyng of Raymondyn <MILESTONE N="41" UNIT="folio"/>and of his men.  Whiche
Alayn wondred mocℏ of it.  And thanne the trew<EPB/><PB N="70" ID="pb.70"/>

man dide calle to hym hys two sones, of whiche one
was called Alayn &amp; was eldest, and that other yongest
had to name Henry, and he sayd to them in this
manere: 'My good children, lepe on horsbak and ryde
on your way to mete yonde straungers / receyue ye
them worshipfully, and see that they be wel and
honestly lodged.  For it is told to me, that they be
six houndred horses or theraboute.' but for nought he
spak.  For thauncyent knyght of Melusyne was come
before that / and seeying the toune was to lityl for to
haue herberowed so moche peple in it / had made to
be dressed tentes &amp; pauyllons, and sent aboute in the
Countre for suche thinges that necessary were to them,
whicℏ he payed or mayd to be payd largely, in so moche
that more vytayƚƚ was there brought than þey neded of.
And thanne Alayn was aƚƚ abasshed whan he herd of
that grete hauoyr &amp; appareyƚƚ that they made there,
and wyst not what therof he shuld thinke or say.

</P><P>Now sayth thystory, that so long rode the two
brethern with theyre felawship togidre, that
they mete with Raymondin, &amp; fuƚƚ curtoysly
welcommed hym, and prayed hym by byddyng of Alayn,
theyre fader, that he vouchesauf to comme and be
lodged within the Fort or Castel of Qyngant with
theyre fader, that shuld make hym good chere.  'Fayre
lordes,' said Raymondyn, 'gramercy to your fader, and
thanked be you of your curtoysy that ye thus proffre
to me,<MILESTONE N="41b" UNIT="folio"/>  But at your requeste I shall goo toward your
fader for to rendre to hym reuerence.  For glad &amp;
fayn I were to see hym, for the wele &amp; honour that I
have herde say by hym.'  Contynuyng suche wordes
&amp; oþer they rode tyl they came nygh the toun.  And
thann came there thauncyent knight to Raymondyn,
and sayd: 'Sire, I have made your pauyllon to be
dressed vp, and tentes ynoughe for to lodge you &amp; al
your men, and thanked be god we are wel purueyed.'<EPB/><PB N="71" ID="pb.71"/>

'Ye haue doo wel,' sayd Raymondin / 'goo and make
ye mery and chere my men, and loke not for me this
nyght, For I goo to the Fortresse with this two
gentylmen.'  And thenne departed he fro thauncyent knight /
toke with hym a few of hys moost famyler men, and
yede to the Fortresse wher the lord of the place aborde
for hym styƚƚ at the gate.  Whan Raymondyn thanne
sawe hym as to hys lord and vncle he made reuerence
&amp; salewed hym mekely.  Wherto shulde I vse prolixe
or longe wordes of theyre acoyntaunce.  but of the
faitt or matere whiche I owe to uttre and say, Lete vs
þenne say.  Whan they had souped / wesshen &amp; graces
said / the lord of the place toke Raymondyn by the
hand / had hym apart upon a bencℏ / there to deuyse
both togidre, whyle that the other souped / the whiche
þe two bretheren chered &amp; honestly seruyd.  The lord
Alayn thanne wyse and subtyl, and that knewe moche
of wel and honour, bygan to raissonne with Raymondin
in this manere: 'Sir knight, grete joye I haue of your
commyng hither, For certaynly ye are full lyke to a
brother of myn whiche was valyaunt, fuƚƚ wyse and
worthy.  he departed <MILESTONE N="42" UNIT="folio"/>fro this land xl. yere goon, for
a stryf that befeƚƚ betwix the nevew of the kinge that
reygned at that tyme and hym, and wete it that this
is the iiijth kynge that haue reyned syn that tyme vnto
now.  And bycause that, to me seemeth ye resemble
my brother, I am the more glad &amp; fayn to see you.'
'Sire,' said Raymondyn, 'therof I mercy &amp; thanke
you / and or I departe from you I shall make you certayn
wherfore and by what inconuenience the stryf that ye
spek of happed betwixt the nevew of the kyng and
youre brother.  For wete it, that for none other cause
I come hither.  but for to shewe publiquely the pure
trouth &amp; certeyntee thereof.'

</P><P>Whan Alayn herd these wordes he was moche
abasshed, and loked on Raymondyn moche<EPB/><PB N="72" ID="pb.72"/>

ententyfly, and after sayd, 'and how shal that mowe be?
ye haue not yet the age of xxx yere / by you may not
be recounted the faytte, the trouth of whiche none
might neuer knowe.  For whan the stroke of the
mysdede happed.  my brother sodaynly departed / so
that I ne none other herd neuer syn whither he was
become.'  'Sire, yf ye vouchesaf / telle mee yf there
is as now yet lyuyng eny man that had on that tyme
auctorite or rewle aboute the kinge that regned whan
the stryf befeƚƚ.'  'By my feyth,' said Alayn, 'one and
no more I knowe, that had gouernaunce in Court that
same tyme, and he hym self vsurpeth &amp; holdeth my
brothers landes as his owne enherytaunce.  For the
kyng gaaf it to hym, for hys first begoten sone to
enjoye it for euermore, the which <MILESTONE N="42b" UNIT="folio"/>hys sone is now of
late dowbed &amp; made knight.'  'For southe,' sayd thenne
Raymondyn, 'wel I wote hys name.'  'And how know
ye hyt?' said Alayn.  'By my feyth,' sayd Raymondin,
'he is called Josselin Dupont / and hys sone hys named
Olyuyer.'  'Sire knight,' sayd Alayn, 'ye say trouth.
But telle me how ye this may knowe.'  'Sire,' sayd
Raymondyn, 'no ferther ye shaƚƚ as now know therof.
but ye vouchesaf to come &amp; your two sones with me,
unto the kinges Court / wete it that I shall declare
vnto you the quarrell &amp; stryf so clerly that, yf ye
euer loued your brother, Henry of Leon, ye shal be
thereof fayn &amp; glad.'  And thanne Alayn heryng the
name of hys brother called, he was more abasshed than
before.  For he wend none other but that hys brother
had be long deed.  And thenne he thoughte longe in
hymself or he ansuerd ony word.

</P><P>Thus, as I haue sayd to you / moche long thought
Alayne, and aftir he ansuerd: 'Sire knight, I
graunt &amp; acorde me to your requeste / sethen that here
I ne may knowe your wyƚƚ.  For therat I lang moche.
I gladly shall hold you company vnto the kynges<EPB/><PB N="73" ID="pb.73"/>

Court.'  'gramercy,' sayd Raymondyn, 'and wel I shal
kepe you fro dommage.'  Wherto shuld I make long
proces, Alayn manded or sent for a grete foyson of hys
frendes, &amp; made hym redy in grete estate for to goo to
the court.  The kynge that knew theire commyng
departed fro Storyon, where he laye, &amp; came to
Nantes.  For the two knightes whiche the kinge sente
Raymondyn were retourned, &amp; had recounted to the
kinge the ansuere of Raymondyn, and the maner of his
estate.  And therfore the kinge was come to Nantes
and manded a part of hys baronye, For he wold not
that Raymondyn shuld fynd hym vnpurueyd of men.
And amonge other he sent for Josselin Dupont for <MILESTONE N="43" UNIT="folio"/>to
haue his Counseyƚƚ on the demande that Raymondyn
wold make.  For he was moche sage.  What shuld I
saye more? thauncyent knight came before &amp; made
to be dressed bothe pauillons tentes &amp; purueyed for
aƚƚ thinges necessary.  Wherfore the folke of the
toune were moche abasshed of the grete appareyl that
he caused to be made / Thenne came Raymondyn,
Alayn, and bothe his sones, and descended into the
chief Pauillon, where they made them redy and arayed
them fuƚƚ richely, for to goo toward the kinge / and
after they departed fro the tentes, acompanyed with
xl knightes wel horsed and honestly arayed that
wonder was to see / and had his barons with hym.  And
whan they come to the kinges place they descended
fro theire horses / and Raymondyn / Alayn and his
two sones entred within the halle, there the kynge
was acompanyed with his barons / made to the kinge
reuerence / after siewyng, salewed the barons &amp; lordes,
the kinge welcommed &amp; receyued þem joyously / called
to hym Alayn, and said to hym in this manere:

</P><P>'It gyueth me grete wonder,' said the kinge to Alayn,
'of this gracyous straunge knight, with whome
ye are so acoynted / What he seketh in this land.'  'Ha /<EPB/><PB N="74" ID="pb.74"/>

ha, sire,' ansuerd Alayn.  'I am an houndred tymes
more meruaylled of the wordes that he yestirday
shewed vnto me / than ye are of his commyng, but
soone shuƚƚ be declared al that we lang aftir &amp; desire
to knowe.'  Thenne Raymondyn, dressyng hys wordes
to theldest sone of Alayn, sayd softly in this manere,
'Sire knight, say me of your Curtoysye, yf one called
Josselyn Dupont be now in this company or nat.'
Thanne sayd Alayn, 'ye--and wold to god so that
the kyng shuld not be dyspleased that I had slayn hym.
For he enjoyeth <MILESTONE N="43b" UNIT="folio"/>therytage that apparteyneth to one our
oncle which we shuld haue.'  And after these wordes
Alayn sayd to Raymondin / 'it is yond auncient knight
that sitteth by the kinge.  And wete it for certayn
that he is replenysshed with all falshed &amp; malyce /
and yonder is his son Olyuyer that weyeth not an

Sire knight,' sayd Raymondin / 'ye soone shal be
auenged of hym yf god wyl.'  And leuyng theire
talkyng, Raymondin hadd hymself fourth before the
kinge, to whom he said in this manere: 'ha, high sire
&amp; mighty kinge, It is wel trouth that common renoumee
ranneth thrughe alle landes. that your Court is so
noble &amp; so raysonnable that it may be called fountayne
of Justice &amp; raison / and that none ne commeth to

Justice and raisonnable after the good right that he
hath.'  'By my feyth, sire knight,' said the kinge /
'it is trouth. but wherfore say you so, fayn I wold wete
it.'  'Forsouthe, sire,' said Raymondin, 'for to vttre &amp;
shew it vnto you / I am come hither / &amp; for none other
cause. but, Sire, yf it plaise you / or I telle it you /
ye shaƚƚ promyse me that ye shaƚƚ susteyne me ayenst

For no kinge acompanyed of a traytour is not wel<EPB/><PB N="75" ID="pb.75"/>

the king, 'ye say trouth / say on hardily.  For I swere
to you by aƚƚ that I hold of god, that I shal doo to you
alle Justice &amp; rayson after the good right that ye shaƚƚ

</P><P>'Noble mighty kinge,' said Raymondin / 'it is wel

man to his nevew. that tyme was in this Countre a
baron whiche was called Henry of Leon, the whiche
was brother to Alayn here present.'  'By my feyth, sire,'
said thanne Josselyn, 'he saith trouth.  and ouermore
the same Henry of Leon slew the nevew of your
predecessour by treson / fledd out of this land, and neuer

his landes and possessyons, and anoone after gaf them

</P><P>TO this ansuerd Raymondyn, 'Sire kinge, he hath

he wexed sore abasshed; neuertheles, he ansuered in
this manere: 'Sire knight, are you come into this
land forto vndertake eny thinge in dyshonour of me?'
And Raymondin ansuerd appertly: 'Fals traytour, he
fourueyeth nat that saith the playn trouth.'  Thanne
he said agayn to the kynge: 'Sire, it is wel trouth that
Henry of Leon was a moche valiant &amp; hardy knight,
curteys and wel condicyoned, &amp; moche was beloved
bothe of the kinge and of his nevew / and vsed the

so was he / &amp; before hym came Josselin, his fader, on
a palfray, and made reuerence to the kinge &amp; hys

For that euery man said he had euyl cause.  What
shuld I make long tale / the holy Euangiles were there
brought, wheron Raymondin swore that Josselyn had
euyl cause, and that he had doon the treson as he had
byfore declared / and after he kneled &amp; kyssed the
book, and sette hym self ayen on the chayere.  And
after Josselin sware, but he stakered, and so timerous
he was that he coude not touche the boke / and also
Olyuer, whicℏ knew wel the trouth of aƚƚ, swore fuƚƚ

hytte Raymondin on the brest or he was ware of hit
moche rudely, For dooyng so he putte to it alle his
strengthe &amp; myght, but Raymondin bowed neuer
therfore / and the spere of Olyuer brak in to pieces,
and with that strok the speere of Raymondyn fell to
the ground.  'Ha, traytour,' said then Raymondyn /
'thou folowest wel the right euyl lynee of whiche thou
yssued.  but that may not auaylle the.' and toke the
sterope that hynge at sadelbowe, that had thre poyntes
wel assured, eche of them seuen encℏ long.  and at
retourne that Olyuer supposed to haue doo,
Raymondyn smote hym on the helmet with the sterop that oo

of a knight that lytil redoubteth hys enemye.  and so
they faught long space togidre and gaaf eche other
grete strokes / and there might men see grete appertyse

toke vp hys spere that laye at ground &amp; came with
grete paas toward his foo mortaƚƚ, whiche the best wyse
that he coude dystourned fro Raymondin that he made
to goo after hym alonge the Champ.  For he dide with
hys hors what he wold,<MILESTONE N="49" UNIT="folio"/> and by that manere dooyng
he supposed to haue made Raymondyn wery that nedes

appertly to[ke] hys hors that he ledde with one hand, &amp;<EPB/><PB N="84" ID="pb.84"/>

toke the spere at other hand / and softly one pas after

sawe hym come, perceyuying his manere he wist
not how ne in what manere Raymondyn wold assayƚƚ
hym / and sodaynly spored his horse, wenyng to haue
come &amp; hurted Raymondyn as he had doon

grete anger, and hitte Olyuyer hors at foreheed with
suche strength that the chaunfreyn entred deep within
the hors heed, so that it bowed the legges behind to
therthe.  Olyuyer thanne sporid his destrier, but as
the hors redressed hym, Raymondyn with hys spere
smote Olyuyer at right syde of hym, so that he
ouerthrew hym to therthe, and so wonderly a strok he gaf
hym betwix the mayƚƚ panser &amp; the Corset that the
spere heed entred deep in hys body / and ar he might
be delyuered Raymondyn cast on hym so many strokes
that he might no more meve hym self, and by force
plucked the helmet fro the heed of hym, and putte hys
knee on his naueƚƚ, and the hand senester at hys nek,
and held hym in suche destresse that by no manere

held Olyuyer as aboue is said long espace of

'I have leuer dye by the hand of suche a valyaunt

toke grete pite on hym and demanded of hym, vpon
parel of the sowle of hym / yf he nothing knew of

nowithstanding yet he held his fader for a trew man /
lawful and not gilty of that same dede.  And thanne
whan Raymondyn, that wel wyst the contrary, herd
hym, he was sorowful &amp; woo, and bete hym so moche
on the temples with hys fust armed with his gantlet
that he made hym so astonyed that he ne saw ne herd
ne wyst what he dide to hym / And thanne stode
vp Raymondin and toke hym by the feet and drew
hym vnto the lystes, And syn he putte hym without

ye haue quytted your self full wel.'  And the king
þenne commanded that Josselin and his sone shuld be
bothe hanged, and they to whom the king comanded
this execucion to be doo wente soone, &amp; without delay
they seasid Josselin, who anoone cryed to the king
piteously for mercy.  And þen the king yede and said
to hym that he shulde <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="folio"/>telle the trouthe of the quarell,
and peradventure he night haue grace.

</P><P>Thenne said Josselin, 'Sire, to hyd the trouth it

Thanne he said all on high to them that were ordeyned,

fourthwith he made them to be hanged, and rendred to
Raymondin his enherytaunce and al Josselyn's land

the feste to be moche grete, and held the king grete &amp;
noble Court open to al men, &amp; was moche glad of that
he had recouered &amp; goten so noble a knight in his

knelyng made hys homage to the kinge that moche

said: 'By my feyth, this knight is not come into this

such a riches / and aƚƚ they said that Raymondin
muste be moche riche &amp; mighty in some other

Alayn and his two sones demened suche joye that
none shuld mow think it.  but yet duryng theire joye
was on other syde made grete sorow of the parents

resteth thystorye to speke of this feste &amp; folowyng
the matere saith how Melusyne gouerned her self while
that Raymondyn was in his vyage.

</P><P>Thystory telleth vs that whiles Raymondyn was in
bretayne, Melusyne made to be byld up the
toune of Lusynen, and walled it with strong walles &amp;
toures one nygh another, and deep diches dide doo
make about it.  A toure she dide to be made betwixt
the Fortresse &amp; the tounne walled with a waƚƚ of xx

men that shuld be styl both day &amp; nyght, at leste one

the nombre of xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> commyng toward the said toune
or Castel / and that same toure she called the tromped
toure.  Now retourneth thistory to spek of the kyng
&amp; of Raymondin, and of the feest &amp; chere that euery
one made to Raymondin.

</P><P>IN this partye reherceth thystorye that mocℏ was
the feest grete at Nantes and the king honoured
moche Raymondin, and there jousted gentilmen one
ayenst other byfore the ladyes &amp; gentyl wemen wher
Raymondin bare hym fuƚƚ valiauntly &amp; goodly that
euery man spak wele of hym, sayeng that he was<EPB/><PB N="89" ID="pb.89"/>

worthy to be lord of a grete land.  And moche were
they abasshed of the grete riches that they sawe euery
day about Raymondin / but who someuer made feest
for Raymondyn, the Chastelayn of Aruaƚƚ, that was
neuew to Josselin Dupont, made aƚƚ the contrary.  For
he sodaynly sent to alle the parentes frendes and
affyns of Josselin, letyng <MILESTONE N="52" UNIT="folio"/>them to knowe how it was
of theire frend Josselyn, and that they shuld be at a
certayn day that he assigned to them at a certayn
retrette that was within the forest of Guerrende that
was of his owne.  And whan they vnderstode the
deth of Josselin þey were sorowfuƚƚ &amp; woo, and
assembled them togider about ii C men of armes, and
pryuely yede &amp; came to the said retrette, where the said
Chastelayn had manded them to come.  And thanne
the Chastelayn in the moost secrete wyse that he coude,
departed fro the kinges court without leue of the king
ne of the Barons / but there he lefte thre squyers of
his for to loke &amp; aspye whiche waye Raymondin shuld
take, and that they shuld anounce it to hym to the
retrette beforsaid.  So long rode the Castelleyn that
he cam to the retrette where he found them of his
lynage, and he reherced to þem aƚƚ the manere of
thaduenture / and how Josselin &amp; his sone were
hanged / and asked of them what they thoughte &amp;
proposed to doo / yf they shuld auenge them on
Raymondin that was causer of it / and to them grete
blame &amp; shame for euermore was bycause of hym
imputed / or elles to lete hym goo free.  Thenne
ansuered for al the lynage an vnwyse &amp; hasty knight
that was sone to the Cousyn of Josselin.  'cousyn
castellayne, we wol that ye wete &amp; knowe that thus
shal nat this oultrageous werk be lefte.  For we alle

to vs whan tyme shalbe.'  And they ansuerd alle with
an voys /--'Blessed be you. and wete it that
whatsomeuer faƚƚ therof / this enterpryse shalbe brought to an
end, and we shal slee that false knight that hath
imposed to vs alle vylonnye &amp; shame.'  And here spekeþ
no more thistorye of them, and retourneth to spek of
the king &amp; Raymondyn. and how he departed fro
the king moch honorably.

</P><P>Thystory saith that the feest dured wel xv dayes &amp;
more. the king of Bretons &amp; hys baronye made
grete honour to Raymondyn in so moche that I can
nat reherce it.  Raymondin thanne toke leue of the
king &amp; of his Barons and humbly mercyed the king
of his good justice that he had doon to hym in his
noble Court, and departed fro them moche
honourably.  And wete it that bothe the king &amp; many his
barons were sory for his departing.  And thus
Raymondyn acompanyed of his vncle Alayn his two sones
&amp; all theyre meyne rode toward Leon.  But it is
trouth that þauncyent knight was departed &amp; goon
byfore / and had doo sette vp bothe tentes &amp; pauillons
and aƚƚ other thinges necessary he ordeyned &amp; made
redy.  And thanne Raymondin / hys vncle with his
two <MILESTONE N="53" UNIT="folio"/>sones and the moost nere of his kynne to hym
lodged them togidre in the Castel.  and the other
herberowed them in the toune.  Whan the peple of
the Countre knew the commyng of theyre owne lordes
sone they were joyfuƚƚ &amp; glad, and made to hym many
fayr presentes after the vse &amp; custome of the Countre /<EPB/><PB N="91" ID="pb.91"/>

as of wyn, of bothe flesh &amp; fysshe, hey &amp; ootys, and of
many other thinges, and they were fayn &amp; glad sith it
playsed not Raymondin to abyde &amp; hold the land, that
they were befaƚƚ in the sayd lynee of theire lord, and
that they were quytte &amp; exempted fro the subgection
&amp; boundage of the lynee of Jossellin.  Raymondin
thanne þanked them curtoysly of theire presentes &amp;
yeftes. commanded &amp; prayed them that they wold be
true &amp; feythfuƚƚ subgets to Henry hys Cousin to whom
he had gyue the land. and they ansuered that þey
shuld doo soo.  Of them resteth thistorye, and speketh
of the spyes that wayted there / of whicℏ one went to
the retrette where the Castellayne of Aruaƚƚ · and the
lynee of Josselin were aƚƚ redy / and the two other spyes
abode for to knowe what way Raymondyn shuld hold ·

</P><P>IN this partye telleth to vs thistory that Raymondin
departed fro Leon, and toke leue of al hys parents
&amp; frendes there, &amp; went to Quyngant where the feste
was grete, and there after the feeste was ended
Raymondyn wold haue take leue of hys vncle Alayn &amp; of
all his lynage / but they dide putte the moost remedy
they coude for to hold hym there a seuene nyght
more.  Wherfore Raymondyn obtempering to them / ye /
ayenst his entent &amp; courage <MILESTONE N="53b" UNIT="folio"/>fullfylled theire
willes.  And in the meane while came to Henry hys Cousyn, a
man that told hym that as he passed fourth by the said
retrette where the Castellayne of Aruaƚƚ was with wel
two houndred men in armes, that they abode for some
folke to whom they owed no good wylle. but he told
hym not whom they aspyed &amp; watched for.  And
whan Henry understode this he toke a squyer of his
and bad hym goo thither &amp; knowe what it was. and he
that was moche dilygent dyde so that he knew the
moost parte of theyre purpos and entent &amp; what
nombre þey were.  Soone after he retourned to Henry
and reherced to hym all that he had found, and that<EPB/><PB N="92" ID="pb.92"/>

they were wel fyue of six houndred fighting
men.  And this tydinges herd / Henry deffendid to the
messanger moche expresly that to no body he shuld
spek of it.  And soone he called his brother Alayn
and some other of the moost noble of hys lynage and
reherced to them alle this werk.  'By my feyth,' said
they, 'we ne cannot thinke what they entende to doo,
but that they wold auenge them on Raymondin our
Cousyn or ellis to meve werre ayenst vs for the said
quarelle.  but alwayes it is good to be purueyed of
remedye · lete vs therfore send for alle our frendes and
kepe vs secretly togidre tyl we see what they haue
purposed to doo / to thende yf they come on vs that
they fynde vs not discouered &amp; vnpurueyed · also yf
Raymondin departeth that he be not surprysed of
them / and yf they entende to doo hym euyl / it is
but for to take the lyf <MILESTONE N="54" UNIT="folio"/>fro hym.'  'By my feyth,' said
the other, 'that is trouth.  Now lete vs hye &amp; delyuere
vs that our mandement be doo of light &amp; secretly.'
And so did they / in so moche that within the second
day after / they were gadred togidre about foure
houndred in nombre men of armes what of theyre lynee
and what of theire affynyte &amp; alyed / &amp; made them
to be lodged in a wod so that few men knew of it.  It
happed thanne that Raymondyn wold no lenger abyde /
and toke leue of Alayn hys vncle þat abode styl at
Quyngant moche woofuƚƚ &amp; sory of hys departyng /
and hys two sones companyed hym &amp; conueyed with
grete foyson of theyre lynee.  And neuer wold lete
hym goo byfore, but made theyre men to be on eche
side of hym, and so long they rode that they approched
the Forest where the Castellayne and his felawship
were in his retrette which Castellayn knew by his
spyes the commyng of Raymondyn &amp; his men and
told it to hys parents sayeng in this maner: 'Now shal
be seen &amp; knowen who euer loued Josselin and Olyuer<EPB/><PB N="93" ID="pb.93"/>

hys sone.  For here we may putte to deth alle the
lynage of hym self þat to vs hath doon suche a shame.'
And they ansuered to hym that none shuld scape, but
alle shuld be putte to deth.  But as the prouerbe saith,
'Such weneth to auenge his shame that encreassith it' /
and so it was of the Castellayne &amp; hys parents.  In this
meane while came þauncyent knight to Raymondin
and said to hym in this manere:  'Sire, ye myster wel
for to <MILESTONE N="54b" UNIT="folio"/>be armed gooyng thrugh the Forest.  For the
lynage of Josselin that ye haue dystroyed loueth you
not, and they might bere bothe to your personne and
to your felawship &amp; meyne grete dommage yf they
found you vnpurueyed / and my herte gyueth me that
soone we shaƚƚ fynd hem' / and Henry &amp; Alayn his
brother and aƚƚ theire lynage were armed all redy, and
had sent aƚƚ theire meyne byfore to make embushe
within half a mylle fro the retrette.  Thenne whan
Raymondyn / had commanded hys men to take theire
armures on hem &amp; sawe them of his lynage that were
alle armed, he ne wyst what say but þe two brethern
his cousyns told hym how they had sent in embusshe
byfore wel iiii. C. of their men for to kepe hym fro hys
enemyes / and they reherced to hym aƚƚ the
trouthe.  'By my feyth,' said Raymondin, 'curtoyse oweth not to
be forgeten / and for it shal not as to my parte fro hens
fourthon.  For yf in tyme to come ye haue nede of
me / I am he that shal at al tymes be redy after my
power to fulfylle your wille.'  And so longe they rode
that they entred the Forest /.

</P><P>Thystorye saith that the Castellayne was in his
retrette and abode for the spye that last he
had sent to wete whan Raymondyn shuld entre the
Forest.  the whiche exploited so that he came nigh
Raymondin / and thanne he lightly retourned toward<EPB/><PB N="94" ID="pb.94"/>

the retrette and to the Castellayn he said: 'Sire, ye
may see hym come yonder.'  And whan the Castellayn
vnderstod hym he bygan to crye with a hye voys /
'on horsbak, &amp; who that euer loued Josselin &amp; his sone
lete hym <MILESTONE N="55" UNIT="folio"/>folowe me.'  Thanne styed euery man on
horsbak / &amp; they were so encressyd in nombre that
they were wel viii C &amp; moo fighting men, and rode
fourth in ordynaunce ayenst Raymondin, and passed
by the embusshe that Henry and his parents had
sent. whiche lete them passe fourth without they discouered
themself. and soone after þey rode after them.  So
longe rode the Castelayn &amp; his folke that they
perceyued nygh them þe foreward of Raymondin. but
abasshed he was whan he sawe them armed gooyng
by ordynaunce / though they were but a few seruaunts
and a C. men of armes / they escryed them to the deth /
And whan they vnderstode it they yede apart &amp; made
to blowe theire trompettes and ranne vpon Raymondyns
folke whiche were sore dommaged or he coude come
to helpe them, the whiche rode as fast as the hors
might walope, and hauyng the spere on the rest
launched among his enemyes / and the first that he
encountred he ouerthrew hym doun to therthe &amp; aftir
drew out high [his] swerde and smote trauersing here
&amp; there and in a lytel tyme he moche dommaged hys
enmyes.  But whan the Castellayn saw hym he was
fuƚƚ woo &amp; sory / and he shewed hym to thre hys
Cousyns sayeng / 'loke yonder is the knyght that
hath shamed aƚƚ our lynage / yf we had our wylle of
hym aƚƚ the other shuld be soone ouercome &amp;
vaynquysshed.' thanne þey spoored theire horses, and aƚƚ
foure ranne ayenst hym / and with theire speeris
recountred hym, soo that they ouer threw bothe man<EPB/><PB N="95" ID="pb.95"/>

&amp; hors <MILESTONE N="55b" UNIT="folio"/>to the erthe and passed al foure fourth.  But
whan Raymondyn saw hym ouer thrawen he spooryd
hys hors, and the hors that was swyft and strong
releuyd hym on hys knees and soo fourth on his feet
so pertly þat Raymondyn neuer lost sterop fro the
foot ne swerd fro the hand.  And thanne he tourned
toward the Chastellayn &amp; so mightily smote hym on
the helmet with hys swerd that he so stakerid that he
lost bothe steropes / and as Raymondyn passed by
hym he hurtelyd hym soo with the sholder that he
feƚƚ doune to the erthe / and the pres came there so
grete that he was sore tradde with hors feet.  Thenne
begane the bataill grete &amp; feƚƚ and sore dommaged
were bothe partes.  And thanne came there also
thauncyent knight and Henry &amp; Alayn hys brother,
and foughte strongly ayenst theyre enemyes.  There
Raymondin made grete fayttes of armes and sore
dommaged hys enemys. but the Chastelayn was had
out of the pres and hys men toke hym another
hors.  Thanne toke the party aduerse, herte &amp; courage &amp;
stoutly fought they ayenst Raymondyn &amp; his
folke. and there were many one slayn of both sydes.  And
wete it that Raymondyn &amp; his folke susteyned heuy
weyght.  For hys aduerse party was mocℏ strong &amp;
moche wel they fought &amp; valyauntly. but the
embusshe of Henry came by the bake syde on them and
assaylled them on aƚƚ sydes so that þey wyst not
what they shuld doo / how they shuld defende them
self nor where they shuld flee / Thenne was the
Chastellayn taken &amp; brought before Raymondin / and
he commanded thauncient knight to kepe hym.  And
in conclusion aƚƚ the other were soone after outhre
take or deed.  And this doon they came to the retrette
where Raymondyn said to hys parents: 'Now lordes
I owe wel<MILESTONE N="56" UNIT="folio"/> to loue and thanke you of the grete
socoure that ye haue doon to me this day.  For<EPB/><PB N="96" ID="pb.96"/>

certaynly I wote that yf it had not be the help of
god and of you this traytour had putte me to deth by
treson, now haue regarde what best is for to
doo.'  'Sire,' said Henry, 'as your wyl shaƚƚ graunte we alle
assent therto.'  'I shaƚƚ saye you,' said Raymondin,
'what we shal doo. lete vs take and assemble aƚƚ the
lynee of Josselin to-gidre / and bothe the Chastellayn
and alle the other his parents we shaƚƚ sende to the
kinge.  Whiche hauyng regarde to theire grete falshed
and treson shal punysshe aftir his good wylle.'  Alle
other thanne said / 'forsouthe, sire, ye say wel.'  Thenne
were chosen out aƚƚ the prysonners that were not of
the lynage of Josselin. and att yate of the said retrette
some were hanged / some at wyndowes &amp; some at
batelments of it.  And the Chastellayn and alle his
parents there were bounde bothe hand &amp; feet as
traytours and prysonners. the whiche Alayn
acompanyed with thre houndred spere men lede them toard
the kinge. and first Alayn presented to þe kinge the
Chastelayne of Aruaƚƚ as he that had conspired &amp;
machined that treson / and al other after. and to hym
reherced Alayn aƚƚ how it was happed. and how
Raymondyn recommanded hym to his good grace / and
that he wold not be dysplaysed yf he had take
vengeaunce on hys mortal enmyes that wend to haue
murdred hym with treson, and that he sent to hym the
Chastellayn chief causer and other his complices for to
knowe by them the trouth of the faytte and for to
punysshe them at his plaisure and wylle / 'And how,
Chastellayn,' said the kinge 'haue ye be so <MILESTONE N="56b" UNIT="folio"/>hardy to doo
suche treson and so shamefuƚƚ dede for the raisonnable
justice that late we dide in our reaume / seeing &amp; also
considering the grete treson that Josselin your vncle
knowleched &amp; confessed to haue doo?'  'By god,' said
the king, 'ye were therof surquydous, &amp; it is wel right<EPB/><PB N="97" ID="pb.97"/>

yf euyl is comme to you therof.'  'Ha, noble kinge,'
said thanne the chasteleyn, 'for your pite lete falle
your mysericorde on me caytyue personne.  For the
grete sorowe &amp; woo that I had of the dyshonour that
Raymondin had doon to our lynage hath caused me
to doo soo.'

</P><P>'By my feith,' said the king,'it is euyl companye of
a traytour / and good it is to shette the stable
before the hors be lost, wel I wyl that ye knowe that
neuer ye shall haue suche purpos as to wyl slee no
gentylman with treson, For neuer I shaƚƚ ete tyl that ye
be hanged with your vncle, for ye shaƚƚ hold hym
felawship, and also aƚƚ them that are of your
cohortacion.'  The kinge made to be take aƚƚe them of hys cohorte of
company, and were aƚƚ hanged / and the Chastelayn he
sent to Nantes, and there he was hanged nyghe to his
vncle Josselin &amp; Olyuyer hys Cousyn.  And thus kepte
wel the king of Bretons Justice in his time regnyng in
Breytayne.

</P><P>Here sayth thistory that whan Alayn was retourned
to Raymondin unto the retrette, and that he
hadd to hym and to the other reherced this þat the
kyng had doon / they said that the kyng had doo right
wel as a valyaunt &amp; lawfuƚƚ justiser shuld doo.  Thenne
called Raymondyn to hym Henry Alayn &amp; other of his
lynee and said to them in this manere: 'Fayre cousyns
&amp; good frendes, I enyoyne &amp; charge you that ye doo
edefye or bigge a pryorye with viii monkes, and that
ye reueste them with rentes and reuenues such that
honestly &amp; goodly they may lyue on for euermore /
they to pray there for the sowle of <MILESTONE N="57" UNIT="folio"/>my fader / for the
kingis nevew sowle and for the sowle of them that are
slayn &amp; ded in this quareƚƚ.'  And they alle said · they
shuld soo doo.  And Raymondyn prayed them to
recommande hym to the kingis good grace to hys
barons and to Alayn their fader.  And thanne he toke<EPB/><PB N="98" ID="pb.98"/>

leue of them / and they were sorowfuƚƚ of theire
departement / and also of this that he wold nat lete
them goo no ferther with hym.  They retourned to
Quyngant.  And Raymondin yede on his way and
cam to guerrende ·and wel he was there festyed and
worshipfully cheryed of them of the toune.  And here
resteth thistorye of Raymondyn · and shaƚƚ recounte
how Henry &amp; Alayn toke leue of theyre lynee and cam
ayen to theyre fader.

</P><P>Thistorye saith in this paas that Henry and Alayn
toke leue of theyre lynage &amp; came to theire
fader and recounted to hym aƚƚ thaduenture of the
Chastellayn, how they were departed fro þeyr cousyn,
and how he hadd commanded &amp; charged them to
fownde a pryory.  'By my feith,' said þeire fader.  'Alayn,
now is the land wel clene delyuered of the lynage of
Josselin; god on theyre sowles haue mercy, how be it
they loued vs neuer.  Now fayre sones I shaƚƚ saye
you what ye shal doo.  First ye shal goo to the kinge
&amp; requyre hym that it plese hym to gyue you a place
for to edefye the Pryorye / and telle hym the maner
how ye be commanded of your Cousyn to fownde
it.  and I byleue he shal gyue you a good ansuer.'  And
they said that thus shuld they doo.  And thanne they
departed fro theire fader, and so long they rode that
they camme to Vannes and founde the kinge departed
&amp; was goon to <MILESTONE N="57b" UNIT="folio"/>Sassymon for to dysporte hym at
Chasse.  And they mounted on horsbak and came to
the gate and passed &amp; entred the Forest and rode so
long tyl they came to the Castel. and founde the kyng
goon to the park to the chasse / and the two brethren
yed after &amp; founde the king nyghe a grete tree by a
staung where he abode aftir the herte that houndes
chassed.  Thenne the two bretheren drew them self aparte
bycause they wold not lette the kyng to see the dysporte /
who perceyued them wel &amp; coude them good thanke<EPB/><PB N="99" ID="pb.99"/>

therfore.  and not long after þe herte came that ranne
in to the staung / and there he was take by chaas of
dogges. / and was hadd out of the watre / and the
curee made &amp; gyue to the houndes as custome is to
doo.  Thenne Henry and Alayn his brother drew them
self byfore the king and salewed hym moche
honourably / and made wel theire message as theyre Cousin
had charged them.  And the king welcommed hem &amp;
moche enquyred of them thestate of Raymondin and
they told hym alle that they had seen of hit / and
after they recounted to hym how he enjoyned &amp; charged
them to edyfye &amp; make vp a Priorye of eyghte
monkes.  them to reueste &amp; empossesse with landis, reuenues &amp;
rents, they to syng &amp; pray therfore for the sowle of the
kingis nevew / for Henry his faders sowle, and for the
sowles of alle them that had receyued deth in this
quarelle.  Also how at hys instaunce they shuld pray
hym for a place where they shuld edefye the said
pryorye.  'By my feith,' said the king. 'the requeste
is wel lawfull &amp; raysonable. and euen now <MILESTONE N="58" UNIT="folio"/>I shall
lede you to the place where I wyl that it be fownded
and made vp.'  Thanne they came out of the wareyne
and came aƚƚ by the walle to thende of the clos. and
thenne said the king: 'Fair lordes, make here to be
edyfyed a Pryory &amp; take asmoche of grounde as ye
lyketh / and I gyue liberte &amp; habaundonne you the
forest for to cutte there the wode.  and whan the
monkes shal be stablysshed there, I enlyberte &amp;
habaundonne it to them for theire vse and to alle

the fysshing in the see that is nygh to this place a
quarter of a legge, and to take in the Forest birdes. &amp;
wild beestes for theire lyuyng &amp; sustenaunce of theire
houshold · and also I gyue to them all the landes erable
that are her about half a legge' / and of alle this he
made &amp; gaf to them good &amp; suffisaunt patents. and of<EPB/><PB N="100" ID="pb.100"/>

all these graunts &amp; gestes the two brethern thanked
the king moche humbly whiche made massons,
carpenters, &amp; other, to come, and in short tyme they made
the chirche &amp; the priorye. and there they stablysshed
whyte monkes. vnto the nombre of VIII. religious
personnes, the whicℏ bere on theire vtterist habyte a
crosse of Azure / and enpossessed them wel for theire
sustenaunce &amp; cotidiane lyuyng / as now yet is.  And
now resteth thystorye to spek of the king of Bretons
and of the two bretheren. and retourneth to recounte
how Raymondin gouerned hym self syn after.

</P><P>Now telleth thystorye that so long abode
Raymondin in the land of Guerrende <MILESTONE N="58b" UNIT="folio"/>that he peased
and acorded togidre two barons of the lande that long
byfore hated eche other to deth.  In so moche that he
made them to be good frendes togidre, and theire
Countrees in peas and rest.  And after he toke his leue
of the barons &amp; of the peuple, which sorowed moche
for his departing. and so long he rode that he came
into the land of Poytou, wher he found many grete
forests vnhabyted / and in some places he sawe many
wyld bestes, as hertes, hynd̛, &amp; roo, wyld bores, and
other beestes ynough. and in other places many fayre
playnes &amp; champaynes. many fayre medowes &amp;
ryuers.  'By my feyth,' said thanne Raymondin, 'it is grete pyte
&amp; dommage that suche a commodyouse Countre is nat
enhabyted with peuple.' and many a fayre manoyr and
places were on the ryueres there that soone might be
redressed as hym semed whiche had be ouerthrawen in
tyme of warre.  And thus rydyng fourth he came to
an auncyent Abbey called Maylleses, and therein were
comprised thabbot and an houndred monkkis, beside
the Convers. and there herberowed Raymondyn for the
grete playsaunce that he toke of it. and þer he dwelled
thre dayes and thre nightes. and gaf to the chircℏ
there many fayre jewelles.  After he departed and<EPB/><PB N="101" ID="pb.101"/>

came rydyng tyl he aprouched &amp; came nygh
Lusynen.  and first he perceyued &amp; sawe the tromped
toure and the new toune, and thenne he supposed not
to be there as he was.  For he knew not the place for
cause of the said toure &amp; toune new made of late, and
moche he meruaylled whan he herd <MILESTONE N="59" UNIT="folio"/>the sowne of the
trompes within the toure /.

</P><P>In this part saith to vs thystorye that whan
Raymondin came aboue Lusynen, &amp; he perceyued
the toune walled round aboute with strong walles and
fortifyed with deep dyches &amp; grete.  'how,' said he to
thauncyent knight, 'What may this be; mesemed
right now that I was forwayed of my way to come to
lusygnen / and yet me semeth soo?'  thenne began
thauncyent knight to lawhe.  And Raymondin said
to hym: 'How, sir knight, jape you with me / I telle
you for certayn yf it were not the toure and the toune
that I see I shuld haue wend to be this nyght in
Lusygnen.'  'By my feyth,' said thauncient knight,
'soone ye shal fynde yourself there yf god wyl with
grete joye.'  Now I shaƚƚ sey you some of Raymondyn's
seruaunts were sent before by thauncyent knight to
anounce Melusyne the commyng of Raymondin. and
how be it she byleued them wel / she made no
semblaunt þerof / but soone she caused the peuple to be
redy for to goo &amp; mete with Raymondyn. and she her
self, acompanyed with many ladyes &amp; damoyselles,
yede to mete &amp; welcome hym wel horsed &amp; arayed
honorably and rychely.  Thenne Raymondin loked
fourth byfore hym and sawe the peple commyng fro
the valey vpward ayenst hym two &amp; two togidre in
fayre ordynaunce, wherof he moche meruaylled. and
whan they aproched they bygan to crye with a high
voys, 'ha, ha, dere lord, welcome may you be.'  And
thenne Raymondin knew som of them that were comme<MILESTONE N="59b" UNIT="folio"/>
ayenst hym / and demanded of them, 'Fayre lordes,<EPB/><PB N="102" ID="pb.102"/>

fro whens come you?'  'My lord,' sayd they, 'we com
fro lusynen.' 'thenne,' said Raymondin, 'is Lusynen
ferre hens?'  They thanne, seeyng that he mysknewe
the place for cause of the new toune &amp; toure / said:
'My lord, ye be at it, but ye mysknowe the place
bycause that my lady syn your departyng hath doo
made and byld this toun &amp; that high toure.  and
yonder ye may see her commyng ayenst you.'  Thenne
was Raymondin moche abasshed / and said not all
that he thoughte.  but when he remembred how she
dyde doo make the Castel of Lusynen in so short tyme
he gaf hym self no meruayƚƚ yf she had doon
soo.  Thenne is come to hym Melusyne that honorably
welcommed hym, sayeng in this manere: 'My lord, I am
right fayn &amp; glad of that ye haue so wel wrought
&amp; doon so honourably in your vyage.  For al thinges
haue be reherced to me alredy.'  And Raymondin
ansuerd to her: 'Madame, it is by the grace of god
and of you.'  And talking togidre of this matere they
entred Lusynen and alighted.  Ther was the feste
grete that lasted eighte dayes, And was there the Erle
of Forest that said to Raymondin, 'ye be welcome.'
And after the feest they departed fro Lusynen and
came to Poytiers toward the Erle that receyued þem
benygnely, and demanded of Raymondin where he had
be so long.  and he recorded to hym alle his
auenture.  And shortly to say, the Erle Bertran was therof joyful
&amp; glad.  <MILESTONE N="60" UNIT="folio"/>And that doon, the brethern toke leue of
hym / and the one yede toward forests, and Raymondin
toward his wyf &amp; lady, which thenne was grete with
child, and bare her terme / the whicℏ expired, she
made a fayre child that was her second sone / he was

Raymondyn her lord.

</P><P>Thistorye sayth &amp; certifyeth that whan the lady
had ended the terme of her childbed, and that
she was releuyd / the feste was made grete / and many
noble men, ladyes, and damoyselles were there, the
whiche, after the feest fuƚƚ honourably toke their leue
&amp; departed.  And that same tyme the lady Melusyne
bylded bothe the Castel &amp; toune of Melle.  Also she
dide doo make Vouant &amp; Mernant.  and after she
made the bourgh &amp; toure of saynt Maxence, and bygan
the Abbey there.  and moche good she dide to poure
folk.

</P><P>The second yere after folowyng she hadd a sone
that was named guyon, &amp; [he] was a moche fayre
child / but he had an ey higher than that other.  And
wete it that Melusyne had euer so good nouryces, and
had so grete care for her children that they mendid
&amp; grewe so wel that euery one that saw them
meruaylled.  <MILESTONE N="60b" UNIT="folio"/>And that tyme Melusyne bigged &amp; fownd
many a fayre place thrughe the lande of Poytou unto
the duchie of Guyenne.  She bilded the Castel and þe
burgh of Partenay so strong and so fayre without
comparyson.  after that she dide doo make þe Toures of
Rochelle &amp; the Castel also, &amp; bygan a part of the
toune, and thre leghes thens was a grete toure &amp; bigge,
whiche Julius Cesar dide doo make, and men called it
the Egles toure, bycause that Julius Cesar bare an Egle
in hys banere as emperour.  That toure made the lady
to be walled &amp; fortyfyed round aboute with grete
toures machecolyd, and made it to be called the Castel
Eglon.  And afterward she edefyed Pons in Poytou
and fortyfyed Xaintes that was called at that tyme<EPB/><PB N="104" ID="pb.104"/>

Lynges / and after she made Tallemounte and
Tallemondois and many other tounes &amp; fortres.  And gate
&amp; acquyred so moche Raymondin thrugh the polycye
&amp; good gouernaunce of Melusyne, what in Bretayne,
what in Gascoynne &amp; in Guyenne as in Poytou, that
no prynce was about hym / but he doubted to dysplaise
hym.

</P><P>Soone after Melusyne was delyuered of her foureth
man child, whiche hight Anthony, none fayrer
was seen before that tyme.  but in his birth he brought
a token along his chyk, that was the foot of a lyon,
wherof they that sawe hym wondred, &amp; moche were
abasshed.

</P><P>Here saith thistorye, that the vijth yere after
Melusyne bare the fyfte child, of whiche at thende
of ix monethes she was delyuered, &amp; was named
raynald.  none fayrer child might men see, but he was
borne only <MILESTONE N="61" UNIT="folio"/>with one eye / but it was so bright &amp;
so clere that he sawe the ship thre kennynges ferre ou
the sea, that is, one &amp; twenty leghes ferre / and
lykewyse on erthe, whatsoeuer it was.  That same Anthony
was fuƚƚ gracyous &amp; curteys, as ye shal here in thystory

Melusyne childed the vi.  child, that was a sone,
and had to name Geffray, Whiche at his birth brought
in hys mouthe a grete &amp; long toth, that apyered
without an encℏ long &amp; more / and therfore men
added to his propre name Geffray with the grete
toth.  and he was mocℏ grete &amp; hye, and wel formed
&amp; strong, merueyllously hardy &amp; cruel, In so moche
that euery man fered &amp; dradde hym whan he was in
age / he made in his tyme many wonders &amp; merueylles,
as heraftir ye shal here in thystorye.</P><P>Thystorye sayth that the ix<HI1 REND="sup">th</HI1> yere after Melusyne
had a sone, that was the vij<HI1 REND="sup">th</HI1>, &amp; hight
Froymond,<EPB/><PB N="105" ID="pb.105"/>

 that was fayre ynoughe, but he had on hys
nose a top of heeris, and in his tyme he was moche
deuoute.  and afterward, by thassent of bothe hys
fader &amp; moder, he was made monke in the abbey of
Maylleses, of whom ye shall here herafter thystorye.

</P><P>In this part sayth to vs thistorye that Melusyne was
two yere without birth of child, but true it is that
in the xj<HI1 REND="sup">th</HI1> yere she had her x<HI1 REND="sup">th</HI1> sone, and was grete
merueyllously / and he brought at hys birth thre
eyen, one of the whicℏ was in the mydel of his
forhed.  he was so euyl &amp; so <MILESTONE N="61b" UNIT="folio"/>cruel that at the foureth yere of
his age he slew two of hys nourryces.</P><P>THe veray hystory saith that so long norysshed
Melusyne her children, that Vryan, whiche was
theldest &amp; first born, was xviij yere old.  he was grete
and fayre, &amp; wonderly strong, and made grete appertyse
in armes, so that euery man &amp; woman had pyte of hys
dyfformytee; for his vysage was short &amp; large, hys one
eye was red &amp; the other blew, and hys eerys were as
grete as the handlynges of a Fan.  and Edon his
brother was of xvij yere of age.  and Guyon had of

and so pert &amp; swyft they were, that alle thoo that sawe

beloued of all the nobles of the land, &amp; made many
faytes &amp; appertyses of armes in Joustes, tournoyeng,

</P><P>It happed that same tyme that two knyghtes of

Guyon, 'ye said trouth.  but what cause you to say

'Southly,' said Vryan, 'ye say full wel.  Lete we send

they sent to the two knightes that they wold come &amp;

whan they were come, the two brethern welcommed

they said to them playn trouth.  'We vnderstand,'
said Vryan, 'that ye haue passed thrugh an yle wher a

the two knightes: 'By my feith, gentil squyer &amp; lord,

said Vryan, 'that I vouchesaf' / and they dide
soo.  And thanne the galeye departed abrode, and saylled
toward the straungers / and escryed þem, &amp; demanded
of them what they were, and they ansuerd, 'We
be two galeyes of Rodes that haue be found of the

alwayes they putte hem self in aray gooyng abacke,

myght not flee, they toke a vessel whiche they had
take fro them of rodes, and had cast the folke that was
in it into the see / and fylled it with wode, oyle, &amp;

it behynd them to mete first with our folke / but as
god wold they were warned thereof &amp; kept / themself
wel therfro / and assaylled theire enmyes at the other

crosbowes &amp; gonnes / and soone after our folk entred
byforce and strengthe of armes the shippes of the
paynemys / and fynally they were take &amp; dyscomfyted,
and putte to deth.  and our folke gate there grete good
whiche the two brethern departed, and gaf to theire
felawes and to them that wer within the two galeyes of
Rodes / and syn rowed &amp; saylled both so long that
they arryued in the yle of Rodes.  And there they
refresshed them, &amp; gaf to the brethern of the religyon
the fustes &amp; galeyes that they had taken vpon the
paynemys, and they soiurned there foure dayes.  And
the maister of Rodes prayd them that they wold come
into the Cite / and they dide soo / and were there
honourably receyued / and the said maister demanded
them of the cause of their commyng.  And the two
brethern told hym that they were come forto socoure
the king of Cypre / And he asked them fuƚƚ humbly of
what land̛ they were, and what they were / and the
two brethern told to hym aƚƚ the troutℏ.  Thenne made
the maister to them greter chere than tofore / and said
to them that he shuld send for som of his bretheren / &amp;

moche humbly therefore. /

</P><P>Now sayth thystorye that so long abode, &amp;
soiourned the two brethern at Rodes tyl the
maister had assembled his folke, and vytaylled &amp; laden
with good <MILESTONE N="69" UNIT="folio"/>men of armes, &amp; archers six galeys, &amp;
saylled with Uryan &amp; Guyon so long that they arryued
nygh to the yle of Coles, &amp; apperceyued grete
lyght.  Thenne the grete maister of Rodes that was in Uryan's
galeye, said to the two bretheren: 'Sires, in good feyth
it were good &amp; wel doon to send a Carueƚƚ vnto yonder
yle, to knowe &amp; aspye what folke is there.'  'I
vouchsaf it,' said Vryan.  The Rampyn then, or Carueƚƚ,
saylled thither, &amp; arryued in to the said yle, &amp; some
of þem descended &amp; founde many grete fyres &amp; lodgis,
and by thexperience that they sawe, they extimed them
þat had lodged there to the nombre of xxx thousand̛

foyson of oxen hornes &amp; of other bestes.  And then
they came ayen in to theire Vesseƚƚ, and retourned
toward our folke / &amp; recounted to them the trouth of
all that they had found.  'By my feith,' said thenne
the maister of Rodes, 'I wene they be paynemys that

they whiche ye haue dyscomfyted were of theire

certayn they were soo / and of them they sayled &amp;
rowed fourth tyl they sawe an abbey on the see coste,
where men sought &amp; worshiped saynt Andrew / and
men saith that there is the potence or cros wheron the
good thef Dysmas was crucefyed whan our lord was
nayled to the Cros for our redempcion.  'Sire,' said
the maister, 'it were good that we should entre that

arryued, and entred the port or hauen / and sent
wordes to thabbot ther, that they shuld not doubte, For
they were theire frendes.  And the maister of Rodes
with other went thider.  And whan thabbot &amp; monkes
knew the tydinges and the commyng of the two
brethern, they were joyous &amp; glad, &amp; sent some of
theire bretheren to Lymas to announce &amp; telle þe socours
that was arryued at theire porte.  Thenne whan a
knyght, Captayn of the place, herde these tydinges he
was fayn &amp; glad, and made fourthwith a galyotte to
be shipped redy, and came toward our folke, and
demanded after the lord of that armee /.  and he to
whome he asked it lede hym where Uryan / Guyon
his brother / the master of Rodes, &amp; many other barons
were in a ryche pauyllon, that they had don to be
dressed on the streyte of the porte / and shewed to
hym Vryan that satte on a couche with hym his
brother, and the maister of Rodes.  And whan he saw
hym he was abasshed of the valeur &amp; of the grete fyerste
of hym, &amp; neuerþeles he yede &amp; salued hym
honourably, and Vryan receyued him goodly &amp;
benyngly.  'Sire,' said the Knight, 'ye be welcome in to this

'By my feyth,' said Uryan, 'it is troutℏ.' 'Then, sire,'
said the knight, 'it is reson that al be open byfore you,

Uryan, 'ye say right wel, &amp; gramercy to you.  Sire

'ye say right wel' / and thus it was doon / and Uryan
made some of hys men to be armed, vnto the nombre
of foure hundred gentylmen of the moost hye barons,

armed them and mounted on horsbak / and the banere
dysployed, rode fourth in mocℏ fayre ordynaunce / and
the maister of Rodes &amp; the other shipped them on the

felawship rode with the said knight that guyded hym
so long that they came &amp; entred in to the toune, and
were right well lodged.  And then came the nauye,
&amp; arryued to the porte, and the horses were aƚƚ had out
of the shippes, and the folke descendid to land, and
lodged them in þe feld without the toune within
tentes &amp; pauyllons / and they that had none, made
theire lodgis the best wyse they coude.  and was moche

the sawdan, that had with hym more than houndred
thousand paynemys.  And for to say trouth, Vryan
had not yet comprised the men of the maister of Rodes,
eyghte thousand fyghtyng men / and therfore the
knight meruaylled, and held it to grete audacite &amp;
hardynes of herte, and to grete valyaunce.  And whan
he considered the grandeur &amp; the facion of Vryan, &amp;
the fyerste of hys vysage, and also of guyon hys

for to subdue &amp; conquere aƚƚ the world.'  and he said
to hymself, þat god had sent hem thither of his benyng
grace for to socoure the kyng, and for to enhaunce the

the kynge by certayn message.

</P><P>Thystorye sayth that the knight made a lettre, the

</P><P>Thystory saith that Vryan called to hym the maister

demanded of them thus: 'Fayre lordes, is the sawdan
somewhat yong, ne of grete enterpryse' / and they

'was he neuer byfore this place to make warre than

said Vryan, 'hath caused hym to passe the see now?
sith he is man of enterpryse, I merveyƚƚ that so long

It happed that about the spryng of the day foure score

two brethern herd theire masse, &amp; semblably dyde the
other prynces &amp; barons / and after the masse Vryan
made to crye, that who wold drynk ones shuld drynk,
and that ootis shuld be gyuen to the horses, and that
at the other tyme that the trompette shuld be blowen,
eueryman shuld be redy that was of the<MILESTONE N="74b" UNIT="folio"/>
Vanwarde.  And they beying in sucℏ estate, the Capteyns nevew
arryued there, and delyuered the lettre to hys vncle,
that the kyng had taken to hym / and the Captayn
toke &amp; kyssed it fourthwith, opend̛ it, and sawe by the
tenour of it how the kyng commanded hym to putte
bothe the fortresse and the toune at the wyƚƚ &amp;
commandement of the two bretheren.  Also that he shuld
commande to aƚƚ good tounnes, Castels, Fortresses,
portes, hauens, &amp; passages that they shuld gyue them
entre &amp; soiourne, and that they shuld obey to
them.  And whan the Captayn sawe &amp; vnderstode aƚƚ þe
substance &amp; matere of it, he shewed the lettre to Vryan, &amp; to
guyon hys brother, the whiche redde it; &amp; whan they
knew the tenour of it they called to them the captayn,
the maister of Rodes, &amp; the two knightes, that had
anounced to them thauenture of the siege, and redde
to them the lettre on hye.  'Thenne,' said Uryan to the
Captayn, 'we thanke moche the king of the worship<EPB/><PB N="128" ID="pb.128"/>

that he doth to vs / but as to vs, our entencyon is not
to entre in to thoos tounes ne castelles, yf we may
goodly passe without fourth, For we thinke to kepe the
feldes, yf god wyl, &amp; make good werre ayenst the
sodan, but telle vs what nombre of men may yssue out
of aƚƚ your garnysons the Fortresses alwayes kept / and
wete it þat force is to vs to knowe it / and yf they be
men of whom we dare trust and be assured / For god
before we tende &amp; purpose to gyue bataylle to the
Sawdan, &amp; to putte to termynacioun, &amp; ende this
warre.  For therfore are we come hither.'  'By my faith,'
said the Captayn, 'that shal be hard to doo, For þe
paynemys are in nombre wel C<HI1 REND="sup">ML</HI1> and more.'  'Care
you not, therefore,' said Vryan, 'For we haue good
right in oure caas / they are come vpon vs without
cause / and though we had goon on them <MILESTONE N="75" UNIT="folio"/>vnto theire
owne lande, we ought to doo soo, For they are enemyes
of god / and doubteles though they be of grete nombre
to the regarde of our felawship / yet one grayne of
peper alone smertith more on mans tonge than doth
a sacke fuƚƚ of whette / ne victorye also lyeth not in
grette multitude of peuple / but in good rule &amp;
ordynaunce.  And wel it is trouth that Alexander, that
subdued so many &amp; dyuerse landes, wold not haue with
hym aboue the nombre of xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> thousand fyghtyng men
for one journey ayenst aƚƚ the world.  And thanne
whan the Captayne herd hym speke so valyauntly, he
held it to grete wele &amp; valeur, and thoughte he was
wel able &amp; worthy to conquere &amp; subdue many landes,
and said to hym in this manere:  'Sire, I shaƚƚ enforce
your oost with foure thousand fighting men, and of two
thousand brygandyners &amp; crosbowes, &amp; other.'  'By
my feyth,' said Vryan, 'that is ynoughe / now doo
that we may haue hem to half a journey nygh oure
enemyes,' and he ansuerd there shuld be no fawte of
it.  And then came there the Captayns nevew, and<EPB/><PB N="129" ID="pb.129"/>

kneled byfore Vryan &amp; Guyon, and said to them in
this manere:  'Noble damoyseaulx / the moost fayre
mayde / &amp; the moost noble that I knowe salueth you
bothe, and sendeth you of her jewels' / and thenne he
toke the ouche of gold that was sette with many a ryche
&amp; precyous stone / and said thus to Vryan: 'Sire, hold
&amp; receyue this ouche of Ermynes byhalf, doughter to
my liege lord the kyng̘, that requyreth &amp; besecheþ you
to were it on you for her sake.'  Vryan toke it
joyously, and made it to be attached &amp; sette it on his
cotte of armes, and said to hym: 'My frende, right
grete thankes &amp; thousand mercys to the damoyselle
tha so moche honour sheweth to me / Wete <MILESTONE N="75b" UNIT="folio"/>it that I
shaƚƚ kepe it moche dere for her sake / and gramercy

presented and toke to Guyon the ring on the forsaid
damoysellis byhalf / and that she prayed hym to bere

so shuld he doo, and putte it on his fynger / and
thanked moche the damoyselle / and þe messager also /
and the brethern gaf moche ryche yeftis to the same
messager.  And soone after the trompette blew, and
eueryman putte hym self fourth on hys way.  and
there myght men be seen in fayre &amp; good
ordynaunce.  And the Captayn sent to aƚƚ the Fortresses &amp; tounes,
and made to yssue out &amp; assemble togidre aƚƚ the men
of armes / and wel were of them aboue the nombre
that the Captayn had sayd to the two bretheren fyue
hondred more.  Vryan thenne lodged hym and hys
felawship on a lytil ryuere / and on the morne erly
they departed, and went fourth tyl they came a lytil
byfore mydday, in a fayre medowe, nygh to a grete
ryuere / and there were foyson of trees / also there was
a quarter of a leghe thens a grete bridge, where they
muste passe / and fro that bridge vnto Famagoce were

and his men that he shuld bring with hym.  There
they laye that nyght, and abode tyl the morne noone.
but alwayes some knightes were goon for theire
dysporte vnto the said bridge, and aspyed there about xv
men of armes that were descended therat / and had
theire speeris in theire fystes, and the salades after the
guyse that they armed them in that Countre / and of
anoþer syde they sawe come about foure houndred
men <MILESTONE N="76" UNIT="folio"/>of armes, that peyned them self moche for to
passe ouer for to greve them of the other side / thanne
came one of our Knightes that escryed them, &amp;
demanded of them what they were / and one of them
ansuerd, 'we are Cristen / and they that ye see at the
other side of the watre are paynemys, that come for
fourrage about the Countre / they haue mete &amp; faught
with vs, and they haue slayn wel an C good men that
were of our felawship.'  'Now, fayre lordes,' said oure
knyght, 'yf ye can hold you, ye shal soone haue socours
&amp; ayde.'  And thenne the knight broched hys hors,
and waloped toward hys felawes, and recounted to
them shortly aƚƚ thauenture.  And whan they
vnderstode this they hastly came to the oost, and mete
with xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> crosbowes men, to whom they bade they
shuld hye þem toward the bridge for to help the xv
men of armes that were there ayenst thenmyes.  And
whan they vnderstode this they walked fast, &amp; cam
nigℏ to the bridge, and sawe thre cristen that were
ouerthrawen on the bridge by strokkes of speerys.
'Fourth,' said then one of them, 'we tary to longe /
perceyue you not how this Dogges oppressen vylaynly
these valyaunt &amp; worthy crystens?' / and anone they
bended þeir crosbowes, &amp; shot aƚƚ at ones / and
ouerthrewe doun on the bridge fro theire horses with that
first shotte xxii<HI1 REND="super">ti</HI1> paynemys.  Whan the mysbyleuers
paynemys sawe this they were sore abasshed, and<EPB/><PB N="131" ID="pb.131"/>

withdrew themself somwhat backward fro the bridge.
Thenne yede the cristen men, and releuyd vp their
felawes that were ouerthrawen on the bridge / and
thenne they made grete joye &amp; toke good herte / and
the <MILESTONE N="76b" UNIT="folio"/>Crosbowe men shote so ofte &amp; so strong, that
there ne was so bold a paynem that durst putte his
foot on the bridghe / but made to come there theire
archers, &amp; thenne bygan the scarmusshing strong &amp;
grete and moche mortal.  but betre had be to the
paynemys that they had withdrawe them self apart,
For the knightes came to the oost and reherced to
Uryan the tydinges therof, the whiche mocℏ appertly
armed hymself, and made hastly a thousand men of
armes to take theire harneys on them, &amp; rode forth
toward the bridge / and ordeyned another thousand
men of armes, &amp; C crosbowe men to folowe hym, yf he
nede had of them / aud commanded that all the oost
shuld be in ordynaunce of batayƚƚ, &amp; betoke it to the
kepyng &amp; gouernaunce of guyon his brother, and of
the maister of Rodes.  Uryan thanne made the
standarde to passe fourth rydyng in batayƚƚ moche
ordynatly / and was Vryan before, hauying a staf on hys
fyste, &amp; held them wel togidre, and so vnyed, that
one marched nothing afore that other.  But or they
were come to the bridge there were come eight
thousand paynemys, that moche strongly oppressed our
folke, and had putte them almost fro the bridge.  but
anoone came there Vryan, whiche alyghted / toke hys
speere, &amp; so dyde hys folke moche appertly / and
made hys banere to be dysployed abrode / and were
the crosbowe men on bothe sydes of hym vpon the
bridge / and then they marched fourth, and bygan to
oppresse and rebuke sore the paynemys, and made
them to withdrawe bakkwarde.  And there Vryan
cryed 'Lusynen' with a hye voys &amp; lowde, and yede
&amp; marched ayenst hys enemys, hys banere euer byfore<EPB/><PB N="132" ID="pb.132"/>

hym.  <MILESTONE N="77" UNIT="folio"/>and hys men after that assaylled the fals dogges
moche asprely, Whiche of the other syde bygan to
launche &amp; to smyte.  Uryan smote a paynem on þe
brest with hys speere so demesurably, that hys spere
apered at back syde of hym.  they medled them
fyersly togidre.  but at last the paynemys lost the
bridge, and many of them feƚƚ doun in to the ryuere.
And thenne passed the crystens the bridge lyghtly /
and there bygan the baytayƚƚ moche cruel, For many
were there sore hurte &amp; slayn on both partyes.  but
euer the paynemys were putte abak, &amp; lost moche of
ground.  Vryan made to passe the horses, for wel he
perceyued that his enemyes wold mounte on theire
horses to putte them self to flyght.  Thenne came the
arregarde that asprely passed ouer the bridge / and
whan the paynemys perceyued them they were sore
affrayed / and who that myght flee, fledd toward theire
folke that lede theyre proye, oxen, kyn &amp; shep, swynes
&amp; othre troussage.  Uryan than lepte on horsback, and
made hys folke to doo soo, &amp; commanded the
arrergarde that passed them ouer the bridge, that they
shuld folowe hym in fayre ordynaunce of bataylle /
and so they dyde / and Uryan &amp; hys folke chaced the
paynemys that fledd sore chaffed &amp; aferd, For al they
that were by Uryan, &amp; they of hys felawship atteyned,
were putte to deth / and endured the chasse with grete
occysyon &amp; slaghter þe space of fyue ooures &amp; more.
And thenne the paynemys ouertoke theyre folke, &amp;
made them to leue behynd them alle theyre proy,
&amp; came vpon a grete mountayne toward Famagoce /
and þer the paynemys reassembled, &amp; putte them self
in <MILESTONE N="77b" UNIT="folio"/>ordynaunce.  but there came Vryan &amp; his folke,
theire speris on theire fystes alowe / at that
recountryng were many one slayn &amp; wounded sore, of one
syde &amp; of other / the paynemys susteyned the stoure
strongly, For they were a grete nombre of folke.  but<EPB/><PB N="133" ID="pb.133"/>

Uryan assaylled them vygourously / and so moche he
dide there of armes that aƚƚ were abasshed, and had
grete wonder of it.  Then came thither the arregarde
that was of a thousand men of armes, &amp; C crosbowe
men whicℏ entred, &amp; marched sodaynly vpon theyre
enemyes, &amp; faught so strongly that the paynemys were
putte abacke, &amp; lost ground.  and so fyersly was
shewed there the cheualry &amp; hardynes of Cristen folke,
that soone they had the vyctory, and putte theyre
enmys to flight, of whiche lay dede on the place foure
thousand &amp; more, without them that were slayn at
forsayd bridge / and the chasse endured vnto nygh the
oost &amp; siege of the paynemys.  Thenne Vryan made
hys folke to withdrawe them, and ledd with them the
proye that the paynemys had lefte behynd.  And
thus within a short while they eslongyd ferre one fro
other / and our folke retourned to the bridge / and the
paynemys went fourth to theire oost cryeng alarme.
Wherfore euery man went to harneys, &amp; yssued out of
theire tentes / and thenne one of them recounted to
the sawdan all thaduenture þat happed to them.  And
whan the sawdan herd of it, he wondred mocℏ who
might haue brought þat folke, that so grete harme &amp;
dommage had born vnto hym.  Thanne was there grete
affray in thoost, &amp; grete noyse of trompettes.  Wherof
they of the Cite merueylled what thing it might be, &amp;
armed them self / and eueryone was in his garde / and
there <MILESTONE N="78" UNIT="folio"/>came to the gate one of the knightes that were
at forsayd brydge, whiche had putte hym in auenture
to passe thrugh aƚƚ thoost, and knewe the convyne of
one parte &amp; of other, also the grete fayttes of armes that
Vryan had don / he escryed hye with a lowde voys /
'open the gate!  For I bring you good tydynges.'  And
thenne they demanded of hym what he was / and he
ansuerd, 'I am one of the knightes of the fortres of the<EPB/><PB N="134" ID="pb.134"/>

blak mountayne.'  And thanne they opend the gate,
and he entred, and they ledd hym toward the king̘,
that soone knew hym.  For other tyme he had seen
hym.  The knight then enclyned hym before the
king, and made to hym the reuerence / and the kinge
receyued hym moche benyngly / and demanded to hym
som tydynges; and he reherced to hym worde by word̛
all the faytte / and how Vryan dyde, &amp; had rescued
the proye / also of thauenture of the bridge, and alle
other thinges, &amp; how hys entencion &amp; wylle was for to
gyue batayƚƚ to the sawdan, and to reyse the siege / &amp;
that shortly / · 'By my feyth,' sayd the kyng, 'that
man ought me god wyƚƚ, for to rescue my land of the
fel &amp; cruel dogges paynemys / and for the holy feyth
crysten to susteyne &amp; enhaunse / and, certaynly, I
shaƚƚ to morne doo fele to the sawdan þat my socour

I doubte hym not of nothing.'  'My frende,' said the
kyng to the knyght, 'goo &amp; say these good tydynges to
my doughter.'  'Sire,' said the knight, 'right
gladly.'  Then came he in to the chambre where the mayde
was, and <MILESTONE N="78b" UNIT="folio"/>moche humbly salued her, and rehersed to
her aƚƚ the auenture.  'How, sire knight,' said she,
'were ye at that bataylle?'  'By my feyth, damoyselle,'
ansuerde the knight, 'ye.'  'And how,' sayd she, 'that
knyght that hath so straunge a face, is he such a fyghter
as men saye?'  'By my feyth, my damoyselle, ye
more than a houndred tymes / For he ne dreddeth no

wete it what that men saye to you of hym / he is one

had now hyerid you for to preyse &amp; speke wel of hym,
he hath wel employed hys coste.'  'By my feyth, my
damoyselle, I spake neuer with hym.  but yet he is betre<EPB/><PB N="135" ID="pb.135"/>

knight, <HI1 REND="und">'goodnes &amp; bounte is betre than fayrenes &amp;

mayde / and retourneth to Vryan, þat abode at the

bridge / And also the Captayne þat had brought the
men of armes, that he leuyed fro the garnysons &amp;
fortresses vnto the nombre of V<HI1 REND="sup">ML</HI1> men of armes, with
two thousand V. C. crosbowe men / and also there were
many footmen / And þey were alle lodged in the

Vryan found his pauyllon dressed vp / and the other
that had be at the pursyewte &amp; chaas of the paynemys,
they lodged þem that nyght the best wyse they coude,
&amp; made good watche.  And here resteth thystory
therof, and bygynneth to speke of the kyng of Cypre, that
was moche joyous &amp; glad of the socours that was
come to hym / and regracyed deuoutely our lord of
it / and in that party passed the nyght.  But who
someuer was glad that was Ermyne, For she coude not
by no manere in the world haue out of her thoughte
Vryan, <MILESTONE N="79" UNIT="folio"/>and desired moche to see hym for the well
that it was said of hym / in so moche that she said in

so thoughte the damoyselle al the nyght on Vryan,
For loue by hys grete power had broughte her

</P><P>The hystorye recounteth here, that on the morne
at the spryng of the day, the kynge had hys
folke aƚƚ redy, &amp; yssued out of the Cyte with a thousand
men of armes, and wel a thousand of Crosbowemen;<EPB/><PB N="136" ID="pb.136"/>

and some brygandyners were embusshed at bothe
thendes of the barrers, for to helpe &amp; socoure hym yf
he were to moche oppressyd by the paynemys.  And
þen the king entred in to thoost, &amp; bare grete dommage
to hys enemys.  For he had commanded vpon peyne
of deth that none shuld take eny prysoner, but that
they shuld putte aƚƚ to deth / and this dide he for
cause they shuld not tende to the dyspoylle &amp; proye,
and that at laste he myght gader them ayen togidre for
to withdrawe them without ony losse.  And then the
oost began to be mevyd / and who best coude of the
paynemys came to the medlee.  And whan the king
perceyued that they cam with puyssaunce, he remysed
hys folke togidre, and made to withdraw them al the
lytil pas, and came behynde, the swerd in his
fyst.  And whan he sawe a knight approuche, he retourned
&amp; made hym to recule abacke.  but yf he atteyned
hym, he chastysed hym so that he no more had
langyng to siew hym.  And there the kynge dide so
wel &amp; so valyauntly, that euery one sayd he was
moche preu &amp; worthy of his hand / and there ne <MILESTONE N="79b" UNIT="folio"/>was
so hardy payneme that oo stroke durst abyde.  Then
came the Sawdan with a grete route of paynemes,
armed on a grete hors, that held a dart
envenymed.  And thanne whan he aspyed the king, that so euyl
demened his folke, he cast at hym the darte yre, &amp;
hytte hym at the synester syde, in suche wyse that he
perced hym thrugh &amp; thrughe, For hys harneys coude
neuer waraunt hym / And soone after the kyng felt
grete anguysshe, and drew the dart out of hys syde,
and supposed to haue cast it agayn to the Sawdan / but
the Sawdan tourned hys hors so appertly that the dart
flougℏ besyde hym, &amp; smote a payneme thrugℏ the

whan the sawdan, that ouermoche had auaunced hym<EPB/><PB N="137" ID="pb.137"/>

with his swerd vpon the heed of hym, that he
ouerthrew hym to therthe.  Thenne cam the paynemes
there so strong that they made the kynge &amp; hys folke
to withdraw backe / and thenne was the sawdan
redressed &amp; remounted agayn vpon a grete hors.  And
thenne was þe prees grete, and the paynemes were
strong / in so moche that they made the kyng &amp; his
folke to withdrawe vnto theire barrers.  Thanne bygan
the Cypryens, that kept the passage there, to shote &amp;
to launche on the paynemes so strong that they dyed
the place with the blood of theire enemyes.  but so
strong were the paynemys, that they gaynstode the
crysten / and also the king had lost moche of hys
blood, &amp; wexed feble, and hys folke bygane to be
abasshed.  And how be it that the king suffred moche
dolour &amp; peyne, neuertheles he resioysshed moche hys
peuple &amp; encouraged them, and so moche they dide
that the fals paynemes might gete nothing on them /
but that they lost twyes <MILESTONE N="80" UNIT="folio"/>asmoche more / and was
the scarmusshing moche fyers &amp; peryllous.  And thus
the kyng of Cypre, by hys valyaunce &amp; noble herte,
recomforted his folke.  and thougℏ he felt grete peyne
&amp; woo, he fuƚƚ wel remysed hys folke into the

was noþing mortaƚƚ but for the venyme, For the dart
was envenymed / and wel it appered within a lytil

certayn he had the herte so full of valiauntnes, as the
faytte shewed it, that he ne dayned not make signe
of eny bewayllyng before his folke, vnto tyme that one
of the barons perceyued aƚƚ his senyster syde dyed with

For the nyght approucheth / to thende that your

hym thus: 'Doo therof after your wylle.'  This knyght
thenne made a houndred men of armes, that were
reffresshed, to come before the barryere, &amp; made to
bygynne ayen the scarmusshing with an C crosbowe

the sawdan was fuƚƚ of grete anger, and escryed to
hys folke: 'fourth lordes &amp; barons, peyne your self

medlee.  And there ye had see wel assaylled &amp;
ryght wel deffended, of that one part &amp; of that

strengthed them soo, he toke courage grete, &amp; ranne

peyne þat aƚƚ the synewes of hys body were open,
wherof, as some <MILESTONE N="80b" UNIT="folio"/>sayen, his lyf was shorted / and by
that same enuahisshing were putte aback the paynemes,

thenne approuched, and was nygh / and grete harme

paynemes withdrew them vnto theire oost, For the
king encouraged hys folk soo that they ne doubted no

hys folke retourned in to the toune.  And whan they
knew the euyl auenture of theire king, they beganne to
sorowe &amp; to make grete dueil.  And the kynge, that
sawe this, sayd to them: 'My good folke, make no

deffende you ayenst the Sawdan / and god our sauyour
shalbe at your ayde &amp; helpe, For yf it playse hym I

ayen.  but neuerþeles, the kyng that said suche wordes
for to resioysshe hys peuple, felt in hym self that he
coude not escape fro deth.  And thenne he commanded
to his folke they shuld make good watche, and gaf
hem leue, &amp; came to the palleys, and there alyghted
&amp; yede in to hys chambre / And thenne came hys

made them to be nombred / and they were founde by

made hys banere to be dressed a bowe shote fro the

Guyon for to hold &amp; bere it / and after he said, al on

descende the mountayne and haue passed at back syde

fourth, the paynemes perceyued that they were not of

and incontynent aƚƚ the foure bataylles in  fayre

assaylled.  But one came to the sawdan, and said to
hym how the tentes &amp; pauyllons were take, and alle

made to sowne hys trompette to withdrawe &amp; assemble

Vryan came first with hys batayƚƚ / and with a grete

putte them self to flight.  But the sawdan, that was ful
of grete courage &amp; of grete vasselage, realyed his folke
about hym, &amp; delyuered &amp; gaf ryght a grete sawte to
our folke moche proudly.  There were many men slayn
&amp; sore wounded / and made hym self to be redoubted

with at lyfte syde and at the ryght syde that none
myght susteyne hys strokes that were about

his folke, he was fuƚƚ woo, and said in hymself, 'By my

And whan he sawe hym commyng he refused hym not,
but toke his ax and wende to haue smyten vryan withal
vpon the crosse of the heed / but Vryan eschiewed
the stroke; the ax was pesaunt and heuy, and with that
vayne stroke it scaped fro the Saudans handes.  And
thanne Vryan smote hym vpon the helmet a grete

charged with that stroke that he was so astonyed and
amased that he neyther sawe nor herde, and lost the

so moche of hys blood that he most there deye in grete

knew that the saudan was deed they were affrayed and
moche abasshed, and neuer aftir they fought with no

esprouued themself there, &amp; faught so strongly, gyuyng

theire kynge þat was wounded to the deth.  Wherfore
he wyst not what to thinke, For he knew not yet the

Captayne and came to the Cite, where he was receyued

that notwithstanding she recomforted her self moche of

moche nobly vpon two grete coursers / and Vryan was

byfore hym hys helmet on a tronchon of a spere.  And
whan they perceyued his fyers visage <MILESTONE N="87b" UNIT="folio"/>they said

Thenne was the kyng woofuƚƚ &amp; dolaunt, and said:

tempeste, that the sarrasyns were al dysmayed &amp;
abasshed / and the tempeste casted them in suche wyse
here &amp; there, that within short tyme they ne wyst

</P><P>Thystory sayth that the kyng brandymount &amp; the

Calyphe of Bandas and his armee, &amp; the puyssaunce of
kyng brandymount of tharse, that assaylled them of
the toune for to take it.  But there was the Captayne
of the place &amp; his peple wel paueysed, that valyauntly
deffended the porte in so moche that the sarasyns
gat there nought / but lost many of their men, and
wysshed ofte aftir theire galeyes with theire gonnes &amp;

Thenne whan the Calyphe vnderstode hym he was

And this they dide.  And whan the Captayn of

</P><P>In this partye sayth thistorye, that in the marches
of Allemayne, betwene Lorayne &amp; Ardane, was a
noble Countrey, the which was somtyme called the
Erledome of Lucembourgh, and now it is named a
duchye.  In that same Countree was some tyme a lord
erle of the land, whiche after his decesse lefte a fayre

made theire homage to her as to the rightfuƚƚ heyre of

whos wyf was deed in her child bed at the birthe of a
doughter, whiche the fader made to be baptised &amp;

and that none heyre he had but a doughter, whiche
was the fayrest damoyseƚƚ of aƚƚ the land / he sent in

made he his mandement, &amp; chalenged the mayde &amp; alle

the lande &amp; all the commynalte wyst it / they said
&amp; sware that syth theyre lady wold not haue hym to
her lord / they shuld shewe to hym that he dide wrong
to the pucelle and to them also.  And immediatly they
garnysshed theire Cites, tounes, &amp; Fortresses.  <MILESTONE N="105b" UNIT="folio"/>And
the moost part of the barons drew themself to the
toune &amp; Castel of Lucembourgh with Cristyne, theire
owne propre lady.  What shuld I make you long compte /
they were nat that tyme strong ne puyssaunt ynougℏ for

the noble men of the land apart, and said to them in
this manere: 'Fayre lordes, ye may conceyue and wel
perceyue that we may not hold longe ayenst the
puyssaunce of the same kinge.  Wherfore yf it seme you

barons, 'ye say right wel; yf ye thanne know some
gentylman worthy to haue our lady, and valyaunt &amp;

that who so went to seke &amp; requyre the socours and

fuƚƚ wel.'  Thenne they fourthwith went tofore
Crystyne theire lady, and worde to worde they recounted
to her aƚƚ this affayre.  And she said to them, 'Fayre

'Lordes,' said she, 'gramercy.'  And thenne they departed

good &amp; lyght horses, and yssued out of a posterne, and
passed by that one side of thoost, so that they were neuer

aspyed no personne; whero[f] al gaf them self grete

knowen that the two bretheren caused it.  Thenne
came the two knightes, captayns of the arryergarde,
&amp; also the Captayne of the vantgarde, to the two
bretheren, &amp; said to them in this manere: 'My lordes,
grete symplenes it is to you thus to traueylle your

the vantgarde marched fourth, and the sommage and
Cartes folowed / and after the grete oost deslodged̛ &amp;
went so long by theire journeyes that they came &amp;
lodged them vpon a ryuere named Meuse, vnder a
Fortresse named Damcastel / And fro thens vnto the siege

Lucembourgh to the two bretheren, &amp; said: 'My lord,

whan they were out of thoost or siege / the gentylman
toke leue of the Captayne, and secretly entred in to

shuld tary and make his company to stand asyde tyl
he were passed the mountayne.  'By my feyth,' said
he þat was proude &amp; orgueyllous, 'Sire daw fole, wel
we muste first knowe what ye be, that say that we

grete toth / 'that shal you knowe anone, For I shal
make you retourne ayenst your wyƚƚ.  I am Geffray

with the grete toeth / he cryed to his folk, 'auaunt,
lordes barons, For yf he escape grete shame shal be to

vnderstode these wordes he drew out his sword̛ &amp; smote
the nethermost of alle vpon his hed̛, so grete a stroke

whan guyon perceyued this myschief he was wode
wroth &amp; fuƚƚ of yre, For he might not come to geffray,
wherfore he commanded euery man to retourne, that
they might haue them self at large to deffende eche

yssued out of that narrow way in to a playn feld̛, And
geffray with the grete toth pursiewed them, the swerd̛

Thenne the lawhing was there grete / but soone after

that wel perceyued hym, &amp; demed wel by hys ryche

the noble &amp; valyaunt geffray, at this first cours, faylled

hys good swerd̛ / and pretendyng that men shuld̛ speke

hys heed almost to the brayne, so that the sawdan was
sore astonyed and euyl bestad̛, in suche wyse that he
nother sawe nor herd̛ / but as geffray wold̛ haue

hys brother Raymond in Forestz, that they shuld be<EPB/><PB N="358" ID="pb.358"/>

with hym at Lusynen the xxvi<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> day of August.  And
whan they were come he shewed <MILESTONE N="211b" UNIT="folio"/>to them al the
matere of the said annuel rente, and said that he neuer
shuld suffre it to be payed; but that he first knew to
whom and why the fortres of Lusynen was bound̛ thus
for to doo.  And whan the last day of August came,
Geffray herd̛ hys masse and receyued ryght deuoutely
the holy sacrement and immedyately armed hym, and
bad the preste putte the stolle about his nek / and
aftir toke the purse with the money therin.  And
þenne he bad his bretheren farwel, sayeng in this
manere: 'I wyl departe and serche for hym that thus
yerly taketh trybute of my fortresse / but I assure you
yf he be no more of strength than I am I shaƚƚ hastly
byreue hym of hys trybute.'  And so he yede vp to
the vpermost stage of the donjon / and his bretheren
and the barons taryed benethe in grete doubte and fere
that geffray shuld be perysshed / but geffray was therof
not agast / but loked long yf he coude see eny thing.

</P><P>Aƚƚ thus as thystory sheweth geffray rested̛ there

tofore hym he perceyued a grete knyght armed of al

geffray, wilt thou denye my trybute that of ryght I
ought to haue vpon the pommel of this toure of the

not therof but that I am a creature of god, and myn
name shalt thou knowe tyme ynough.'  And without
eny more questyon eche of them recountred other with
myghty &amp; gret strokes.  And what with that and with
the stampyng of theire feet, the noyse was so grete
that al þey that were benethe were abasshed, and
supposed̛ that the donjon shuld̛ haue faƚƚ.  Wherfor
they wyst wel that geffray had somwhat to doo.  And
his bretheren shuld haue assysted hym, but geffray had
them deffended so to do.  And wete it wel whan the
knyght of the tour fond̛ Geffray so fyers &amp; so strong,
he putte his swerd̛ vp in the shede and thrugh his
paueys behind̛ hym.  And whan Geffray sawe hym
that doo / he dyde lyke wyse with his sheld̛ / but he
with bothe his handes smote the knyght vpon the
helmet with his swerd̛ so myghtyly that he stakerd̛
þerwith.  And thenne the knight toke geffray in his
armes / and with that geffray lete faƚƚ his swerd̛ and
wrestled with hym / and wete it wel ther was lytel

geffray wyst not where he became.  'By my feyth,'
sayd thenne geffray, 'here is apert messager, I haue
grete meruaylle what this may be,' and so came he
doun and brought with hym the knightes sheld that
he had wonne.

</P><P>Thystorye witnesseth whan Geffray was come doun,

ryght forth said geffray, 'I chalenge the, wherfor

he sette the spere in the rest and geffray lyke wyse /
and so eche of them recountred other / by force wherof
they brak thaire speris to the hard fyst in many
pieces.  And whan they had thus manfully broken theire speris
they drew out theire swerdes and smote eche other

seaced.  And so grete was the batayƚƚ that none
<CORR SIC="whic[hbar]">wist</CORR> whicℏ of them had the bettre.  And thenne
the knight bygan to say to geffray / 'here me now, I

geffray ouer the ryuer to his bretheren, whiche asked
hym how he had doo and where hys party aduerse was

that the kynges of Armanye ben yssued of that lynee,
I wyl shewe herafter an auenture that befeƚƚ to a kyng
of Armanye.

</P><P>Thystorye sayth that long after the deces of kyng
guyon of Armanye, Ther was a kinge of that
land̛ yong and fayre, lecherous and folowyng his wyƚƚ.
The kyng vnderstod̛ by the report of som knightes
vyageours, that there was in the grete Armanye a
Castel whereas was in the most fayre lady that men
wyst at that tyme in al the world / the whiche lady
had a sperhauk / and to al knightes of noble extraction
that thither went &amp; coude watche the said sperhauk
duryng the space of thre <MILESTONE N="214" UNIT="folio"/>dayes and thre nyghtes
without slepe / the lady shuld appiere tofore them and
gyue them suche worldly yeftes as they wold wysshe
and were desyryng to haue, except only her self.  This
kyng thenne that was lusty and in his best age, and
that vnderstod̛ the renommee of thexcellent beaulte of
the said̛ lady / said he wold go thither / and that of
the lady he shuld nothing take but herself.  But wete
it that in the said Castel might none entre but ones in<EPB/><PB N="363" ID="pb.363"/>

a yere / and that was the day tofore the vygille of
saynt Johan / and the next day after saynt Johans
day euery man must departe thens.  Whan the said
kyng was redy he departed &amp; rode with noble company
so long that he cam to the forsaid Castel at the day
assygned, tofore the which he dide dresse vp a ryche
pauyllon and there he souped, and aftir went to rest.
And on the morne he roos and herd̛ masse / and after
that the masse was do, he drank ones, and syn armed
hym and toke leue of them that were come with hym,
whicℏ were sorowfuƚƚ for his departing, For they
trowed that neuer he shuld haue come ayen.  And
this doon the kyng yed toward the sperhauk in the
Castel. /

</P><P>Here saith thistory that whan the king was at
thentree of the Castel, an old man al clothed in
whyte cam ayenst hym, &amp; asked hym who that had
brought hym thither / and he ansuerd̛ in this manere:
'I am come hither to seke thauenture and to haue the
Custome of this Castel.'  And the good old man said to
hym / 'ye be ryght welcome, folow ye me, and I shal
shew you the auenture that ye seke for.'  Thenne
yede the king aftir the old man / and gretly was he
meruaylled of the grete &amp; inestimable riches <MILESTONE N="214b" UNIT="folio"/>that he
sawe, within the place.  And thene entred the old
man into a noble haƚƚ rychely hanged, And aftir hym
entred the kyng that perceyued̛ in the myddes of the
haƚƚ a long horne of a vnycorne that was fayre &amp;
whyte / and therupon was spred a grete cloth of gold
wheron stod the sperhauk and a gloue of whyt sylk
vnder his feet.  Thenne said the old man to the kynge
in this wyse: 'Sire, here ye may see thaduenture of
this Castel / and with it sethen ye are so ferfoorth
cōme ye must watche this sperhauk thre days and thre
nyghtes without slep.  And yf Fortune suffre you so

And to dryue fourth the tyme walked vp &amp; doun the

many prynces and dyuerse oþer for the makyng &amp;
compilacion of this present hystorye vpon the said
matere.  And also I haue putte my self to myn
vtermost power to rede &amp; loke ouer the Cronykles &amp;
many bokes of auncyent hystoryes, to thende that I
might knowe the trouth of the forsaid matere.
Therfore yf I haue wryton or shewed̛ ony thing that to som
semeth neyther possible to be nor credible, I beseche
them to pardonne me.  For as I fele &amp; vnderstand̛ by
the Auctours of gramaire &amp; phylosophye they repute
and hold this present hystorye for a true Cronykle &amp;
thinges of the fayry.  And who that saith the contrary /
I say the secret jugements of god and his
punysshments<EPB/><PB N="371" ID="pb.371"/> are inuysible &amp; impossible to be vnderstand or
knowe by the humanyte of man./  For the
vnderstanding of humayne Creature is to rude to vnderstande the
spyce espirytuel, &amp; may not wel comprehend̛ what it
is / but as ferre as the wylle <MILESTONE N="219" UNIT="folio"/>of god wyl suffre hym.
For there is found in many hystoryes Fayries that
haue be maryed̛ &amp; had many children / but how this
may be the humayn creature may not conceyue.  For
these poynts and suche other god hath reteyned þem
in his secrets.  And the more that the personne is of
rude entendement the ferther is he fro knowlege of
it.  And he that is replet of scyence naturel, the rather
shaƚƚ haue affection to byleue it.  Notwithstandyng no
creature humayn may not obteyne the secrets of
god./ how be it saint paule saith in hys epystles to the
Rommayns, 'that al thinges ben knowen by humayn
Creature' / but the glose reserueth &amp; excepteth the
secrets of god.  For the kynde of man is to vnderstand
the ferther that he trauaylleth in reaumes and Countrees /
the greter knowleche hatℏ he of euery thinge / than he
that resteth in his owne Countre and neuer remevyth.
And semblable wyse this historye is more credible for
as moche as it is not auctorised by one man only / but
also by many noble Clerkes.  Now of this proces I wyl
make no ferther mencion / but humbly I beseche you
and alle them þat shaƚƚ here or rede this hystorye /
that yf there be ony thing that be nuyouse or
desplaysaunt to you / wyl pardonne me &amp; hold me
escusid.  For yf a man dooth as wel as he can / he ought to be
accepted.  For in som cas the good wylle of a man
is accepted for the dede./  And here I, Johan of Aras,
ende the hystorye of Lusynen / <MILESTONE N="219b" UNIT="folio"/>beseching god of his
hygh mercy to gyue to þem that be passed fro this
mortaƚƚ world hys eternaƚƚ glorye / and to them that be
lyuyng, prosperous and blessidfuƚƚ endyng./</P><TRAILER>[Here fynyssheth the noble hystorye of Melusyne.]</TRAILER></DIV1></BODY><EPB/></TEXT></DLPSTEXTCLASS>
