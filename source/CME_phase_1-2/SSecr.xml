in the lawe of god, and make him regne in gladnes, in

the kyng, haue put in execucioun his comaundement, and
travaylid forto gete the book of good thewes to him; whiche is
callid the secrete of secretis of the makyng of Aristotille, prince
of philesofris, sone of Machomete of macedonye, which was sent
to his discipille as in governaunce Alexandre the emperoure,
sone of kyng Philip of Grece, the whiche Alexaundre had two
Crownes.  This book made this forseyd Aristotille in his gret
age, whan he myght not travayle ne done the nedis that he had
in charge of Alexandre.  ffor Alexandre had made him governoure
and maystir aboue alle othir, for the excellent witt þat he had in
clergie and sotille vndirstondyng, for euyr he was stodiyng in
good and gracious thewes, charitabille, spirituelle and
contemplatyf; and also he was so wys &amp; meke, and lovyd resoun and
rightwisnes; and euyr reportid trouthe and lewte.  Therfore
oold Philesofres seyne by him, that they haue founden in Greke
bokis that god hath sent his excellent Aungille and seyde to
him, "y shalle do the to be namyd thorugh alle the world more
for Aungille than for man."  And witith welle that Aristotille
made in his lyvyng many wondres, of the whiche <MILESTONE N="2b" UNIT="folio"/>some be right
meruelous to telle; and in his diyng fille many mervelous
thingis.  Wherfore a certeyne Religioun helde an opynyon that
Aristotille was mountid vp to hevene in lyknes to a dowue of
fyre.  And as long as Aristotille lyvid, Alexandre bi his
counselle helde alle londis vndir foote and conquerid alle lordshipes
of the world, and thorugh alle londis went his fame and his
renome.  Alle nacions were putt vndir his imperialite and
comaundement, and specially they of perce and of Arabie, and
no lond durste withstond him in word nor dede.  And
Aristotille made many fayre Epistolis for the gret loue that he had
to Alexandre, forto make him knowe alle secretis that bilongith
any erthely man to knowe or vndirstond.  And on of his
Epistelis is here vndir writene, which he sent to Alexandre.  ffor
whan Alexandre had put hem of Perce in subieccioun, and the
grettist men of Romaynes had in his prisone, he sent an Epistille
to Aristotille in these wordes folowyng.

The cause without <MILESTONE N="4b" UNIT="folio"/>is whene the lord wisely dispendith his

yeue yeftis largely to euery man aftir that he is worthi: and this
is a gret poynt of wisdome, forto enforce him silf to haue the
hertis of his subiectis thorugh good werkis. and this is the first
degre and principalle foundacioun of his prosperite.  And that
he mayntene rightwisnes and even iustice, as welle to poore as
to riche, and that his rightwisnes be medlid with pite and
mercy.  The cause within is, that his philesofris and grete
wisemen of clergie be had in worshipe and high recomendacioun:
ffor god hath recomendid to hem a part of his high science.
And y recomende to the this science and secrete of wisdome,
forthwith the othir that thou shalt fynde in dyuerse partis of

thou shalt fynde the cause fynalle of thi principalle purpos.
ffor whan thou hast vndirstond the sothe of the significacions of

And yefith grace to do [to those] þat stodien forto knowe that is

</P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="SSecr:7" TYPE="chapter" ID="DIV0.7"><HEAD> Of the largenes of a kyng. Cam. 4m.</HEAD><P>tHer are foure condiciones of kyngis.  ther is a kyng that
is large to him silf and large to his <MILESTONE N="5a" UNIT="folio"/>sugetis.  Ther is a
kyng that is skars to him silf and large to his sugetis.  Ther is
a kyng that is larg to him silf, and skars to his sugetis.  And
ther is a kyng that is both skars to him silf, and to his sugetis
also.  Men of ytalie seyne, that ther is no vice in that kyng
that is skars to him silf, and large to his sugetis.  The Iew
saith, that kyng is good that is skars to him silf and to his
sugetis bothe.  The parisien saith, that kyng that is large to
him silf and to his sugetis bothe, he is not worthi to be in no
preysyng, but werst of alle othir.  And if he be skars to him
silf and to his sugetis bothe, his Rewme may not stonde longe
in prosperite but sone come to distruccioun.  Than it nedith
wisely to enquere of vertues and of vicis, what is largesse and
what is skarsnes, and wherin stondith the erroure of largesse,
and what disese cometh of skarsnes.  It is clere thing, that þe
qualitees arne forto be reprovid, whan they aliene them from
ther meene.  And wite ye welle that it is hard thing forto kepe
largesse, and light thing forto passe it.  And it is a light thing
a man to be skars or foole large.  And if thou wille gete larges,
biholde and considir thi power and thi ricches, and also the tyme
of nede and the deservyngis of thi men.  And than owist thou
forto yeue mesurably vnto hem that haue nede therto, and best
haue deseruyd it, and he that yevith othir wise passith the
rewle of largesse.  ffor he that yevith his good to suche as be
not worthi, [it] is but lost, and he þat spendith his good out of
mesure shalle sone be poore, and this makith her enemyes to
haue maystrie ouyr hem.  Than he that yevith his good in
tyme of nede to suche as haue nede therto, and principally to
suche as haue deservid <MILESTONE N="5b" UNIT="folio"/>it, suche a kyng is large to him silf and
<EPB/><PB N="8" ID="pb.8"/>
to his sugetis bothe, and his rewme shalle stonde in gret
prosperite, and his comaundementis shul be fulfillid.  And he that
dispendith the goodis of his Rewme out of ordir and discrecioun,
and yevith suche as be not worthi, ne haue no nede þerto, that
kyng distroyeth his peple and the comoun good of the Rewme,
and is not worthi forto regne, for he is fool large.  The name of
skarste is vnconvenient to a kyng, and yville bicometh to his
royalle maieste.  Than if a kyng wolle regne worshipfully, it
bihouyth him neyþer to haue that on ne that othir of two
vicis, skarste ne fool large.  And this may not welle be doon
without counselle.  Therfore it nedith with gret diligence to
haue an Inwijs man and a discrete to counselle, the which must
be chosene among many othir, and suche a man must be
commyttid to suche a charge bi the kyng and his wys counselle,
forto governe the ricches of the Rewme as it owith best to be

Nero hadde the wyse Clerke Seneca to his mayster; This
wourthy Clerke Seneca longe abode and hadde hoppe of grete
reward for his trauaille and his good Service.  To whom sayd
Nero, "chese in whate tree thow wilte be on-hangid̛, for that

whate maner he hadd the deth I-deseruyd̛ and Suche rewarde.
Than makyd Nero a Sharpe Swerde to florysh ouer Seneca is
hede.  And Seneca that the deth dowtid, wriet the hede atte
the tretyngis of the Swerde.  Than sayde Nero, "Maystyr, why
wryest thy hede for the Swerde?"  Seneca answerid̛, "I ham a

"I dowte the nowe als moche as a chylde and lyke as y a

Than he makyd hym a bathe to be ordeynyd, and of bothe his
armes in the bath to lette blode.  So myche he bledd that in
the bath he diet.  Boyce in the boke of consolacioun seyth, that
this Nero makyd his brodyr to be slayn̛, and his modyr he
made be slayn̄ and oppenyd, for that he wolde witte and See,
how he was in the maris y-bore and fedde.  And for-als-moche
as the Feciciens and lechis hym reprouyd of the deth of his
modyr, for hit was agaynes reyson̛ and kynde, that the sone
sholde do slee his modyr that grette doloure for hym sufferid̛
and with grete trauaill hym norishid, Than sayde Nero, "make
ye me with chylde, and ber a chylde that I may knowe how
grete doloure and Payne hadd my modyr wyth me," and the
Ficiciens sayde, <MILESTONE N="21L" UNIT="folio"/>"That may not be, for hit is agaynys kynde."
Than sayde ham Nero, "If ye make me not wyth chylde, wyth
cruel dethe I shall make you al dye."  Sethyn thay hym yaue
pryuely a lytill toode in a drynke, and by crafte thay makyd hit

that wyth nede y may my breth wyth-drawe."  Than thay yaue

therof hadd, and hym merwelid of Suche an shape; And the
lechis hym sayde, "The shappe is suche, for-why thow woldyst
not abyde the tyme of chylde-berrynge."  Sethyn he
commaundid to kepe his chylde and welle to norryshe, and that hit

and Paule: ther-aftyr he hym be-thoght and merveillid of the
brandynge of Troy.  And forwhy that he wolde witte how grete
was the fyre-blaste therof, he makyd the Cite of Rome afyre to

Passynge faire towre huge of heyght in the Cite afyre was.

Than he that the Emperoure of al the worlde hadd and
lordshupp in his lyue, he nad noght aftyr his dethe so moche

wilde bestis and fleynge fowlis to be deuourid.  Nero in ill tyme
hym̄ myght not Suffice the lordshupp of Solerne ther̛ as the day

Aftyr all this glorie, hym befell the fowle dethe; al men hit

that the troians that day of the entente of har victorie cessid:
Vnto the whyche neuer aftyr thay ne myght not come, but in

Philosofre, "I haue now shewid the my law and my feyth, now

Than sayde the Iue, "And whate yf a man haue y-do the

The hardy <MILESTONE N="34L" UNIT="folio"/>wille not leue that he takyth in hand for speche of

that he hath Sufferyth he wile haue no remembrance, for-why,
he ne holdyth hym not y-lowet ne vndyrfote of the dyssayses

Anothyr condicion̄ hath the manfull othyr the hardy, that neuer

Percewe nethyr by worde ne by semblaunt, that he hath the

See his men to bene ouercome.  The Prynces in olde tyme ne
were not covetous of golde ne Siluer, And therfor more gladly
they yawyn than resceuet.  Vegesce tellyth, that a nobil
consailloure of Rome that Fabrice was callid, a wyse and a worthy
man þat lowid not yftis to rescewe, Answarid to an
Ambassatoure of a fere Estraunge contre, that hym proferid a grete Some
of golde, "Go," Sayde he, "to thy contrey wyth thy golde, I
haue no cure to resceue; Leuer is hit to me to comaunde tho

nobill duke of Rome, whan he Saue well that haniball the

besiegid the Cite of Rome longe tyme, and So hugely slayne of

Haniball the Sige forsoke, hastely to Cartage he wente, wyth

and mery, and Sayde to the Romanes, "Fayre Sirres, affrike to
yow haue y conquerid, And nothynge of the conqueste haue y
rescewid Saue the Name."  As the tyme and the nedes askyd,
the Princis in olde tyme they contynued ham, Some tyme as a
lorde, anothyr tyme as a fellow, this wittnessyth Valery, that
tellyth that kynge alexandyr lad in a tyme a grete hoste in full
colde weddyr.  atte evyn̄ when he restid, he satte in oon hey
sette by a fyre; he rewardid aboute, and Sawe an olde knygth
quakynge for colde.  Anoone he descendid fro the Seete, And
toke the knygth in his armys, and Seete hym in the Sette by
the fyre, there as he hym̄-Selfe Sate.  And therfor hit was no
merveill that men wolde so gladly Serwe Suche a lord, that
bettyr lowid his knyght than his owyn̄ dignite.  Grete and hey
dedys toke on ham Prynces in olde tyme, And Smale thynges
thay lettyn̄ to Smale men.  Ensampill of this vs tellyth Orosie,
that well couthe the Stories.  Cyrus, the kynge of Pers, hym
besied to conquere babilon̄, the grete stronge Cite; but he was
moche y-lettyd by an hugy ryuer rennynge by the Cite wallis.
In a day whan thay wolde assaute make, a knyght fryst by

than he toke the Cite, hit destrued, and the wallis therof he did
down̄-caste into the fundemente.  Hit was not y-holde proesse ne
chyualry to assayle a man vnwarnyd, but olde men helde hit for
cowardy.  And therfore was alexandyr, the kynge Piames Sone
of Troy, moche to blame, that in the tempill of apollyn by
dysceyte and treyson slow achilles the worthy and doghty
knyght.  Holy writte reprowyth Ioab, Prynce of kynge Dauyes

Dauyes Son, therof Vengeance toke, and makyd hym̄ be Slayne,
as the boke of kynges vs tellyth.  Trouthe and verite, more than
oppynyon or falsnesse, lowid olde Pryncis.  Ensampill of that
vs tellyth Valery, and Sayth that in olde tyme wher two
frendys, that oone was callid Hamound, that othyr Phicia.  On
of this was take by Denys, the cruel Tyraunte, kynge of Cezillie,
he woulde haue Slayn̄ hym, he askyd of his dethe respite in-to
the tyme that he had y-makyd his testament and dysposid his
godys.  The tyraunt hit grauntid vp that covnantte that he a
plege for hym wolde Putte into a certyn̄ day.  He Putte In his
frende for hym and went forthe.  Many dayes Passyd, the
terme neyghed, and he came not.  Euery man helde hym a fole
that faste was, and sayde, <MILESTONE N="49" UNIT="folio"/>"folych Haste thow done, to Putte
thy-Selfe in Hostage for thy frende.  He will not agayne cvm,
dey thow moste." he answerid, "I kno well my frende, that he
atte no tyme couaunt wold breke: well know I, and Sertayne I
haue of reuenine."  Whan the terme came, his frende repairet
and hym presentid, And to the tyraunt Seyd, "see me here, lete
my frende Passe, for y haue hym acquited."  Denys remembrid
hym of So grete <MILESTONE N="36bL" UNIT="folio"/>trouthe, frendshupe, and lewte, and for-yaue his
male talent, And prayet ham bothe to rescewe hym to ben thare
fellowe.  By losyngrie to Plese grete or Smale, hyt is contrary to
the vertue, Fortitudo, and therfor the Phylosofers that were full
of vertues, Leuer was to ham to Suffyr grete myssayse, than by
losyngerie grete auere to gette.  Als Valery tellyth, Dyogen the
Philosofre. in a certayn̄ day gederid wourtes to his mete, And
therfor a losynger Aristipus to hym Sayde, that was with denys
the tyraunt, "Diogen, thow sholdyst haue no mestere to ette
<EPB/><PB N="176" ID="pb.176"/>
wortes, and thow woldist losenge kynge denys."  Dyogen
answarid, "and thow woldiste ette Suche mette, thou Sholdyste
neuer nede to losynge kynge denys."  None hardy or manfull is
not lyght of thoght, nethyr haue no mervelle that many pouer
men mervelyth of̘.  Of thes vs tellythe Valery, that in a certayn̄
battaill descendyd an halte man, and therfore Some of the
Same battail hym Scornyd.  the halte man answerid, "I ne
ham not maymet in handis ne in armes, thegh y be halte-footed:
moche more bettyr I shall fyght, for y ne haue noo hope to fle."
Of anothyr he tellyth vs, to whom his fellowe sayde, "So grete
Plente thay of Pers haue of Arowes that the Sonne Vixith all
durke, whan they begynnyth to sote; bettyr is to fle than so
many Pepille to assaile."  That othyr as an hardy man answarid,
"the Plente of arowes that thow spekyste of sholde vs Plese
moche, ffor the weddyr is ful hote, And there-for moche the
bettyr we shall fyght vndyr the shedow of the arowes."
Ouermych to thynke dissayse and aduersiteis that ben Passid,
appertenyth not to hym that hardy is, for that shal make hym feynte.
For yf kynge Alexander had moch thoght of tribulacionys and
peynys that he Sufferid in Perse, he nade neuer be hardy to
entyr in Inde.  And yf Scipyon had ouermych chargid the
damages of Rome, he had neuer ben hardy to entyr in affrike.
Of the comendacion̄ of Scipion we <MILESTONE N="37L" UNIT="folio"/>fyndyth y-writte, that als
longe as he hadd to done, hym thoght that nothynge was done.
Iulyus Cesar gladly for-yaue the wronges that to hym was done,
and by So mych the lordshupe of al men he gette.  The hardy
hath grete Sufferaunce, bonerte, Stabilnes, and verite, and
therfor he chargyth not of preysynge ne of myspreysynge, for hit is
a grete noun certayne of good renoune, that a man Putte hym of
anothyr manys mouthe to be Praysid.  For by Speche of the
Pepille, a coward may be as Prowos as Ector of troi.  Natheles,
as is afore in this boke declarid, in foreyne gouernaunce a prynce
sholde desyre and gete good renoune, by obeysaunce to god, and
in Vyse gouernance of his speche to godis wirchippe and profite
of the Pepille, and for no bobaunce as dyuers men dothe, whych
yewyth yeftys to Rymoris whyche Praysythe <MILESTONE N="49b" UNIT="folio"/>Hym̄ Beste that

oftetymes sholde Enquere whate that the Pepill of hym spekyth,
<FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">Sepius inquiras quid de te fama loquatur</HI1></FOREIGN>, that is to Say,
"Enquere thow ofte-tymes what thynge is hit that fame Spekyth
<EPB/><PB N="177" ID="pb.177"/>
of the."  Kynge Alexander was callid of many a man that hym
losengit, 'Iupiter, the grete god'; but he wyste weƚƚ that thay
lied.  And therof happid in a tyme that he assieget a Cite, his
hoste makid therto assaute, The Cytteseynes ham defendid,
Alexandyr was woundid in the thegh, but he wolde not departe
fro the hoste, tille the assaute was fulfillid.  aftyr, he lyght fro
his hors and in Softe laghynge Sayde, "This wounde shewyth
wel that I is not god, but a dedly man, for hit grewyth me sore."
Abow al thynge lowed Prynces in olde tyme the commyn prowe
and the auctoricement of the Pepill, and therfor thay soght not
riches ne tresures to har owyn prow, but for the commyn prowe,
ne delycate <MILESTONE N="37bL" UNIT="folio"/>mettes ne drynkes thay soght not, but als lytill as
thay myght; And more for othyr men than for ham-Selfe.  And
therfor as me-thynkyth the grete abstynence that oure Irysℏ
enemys Supportyth in mettes and drynkes, is moche the cause
that thay in were often-tymes haue thare Purpos.  For of a
gouernoure of Rome tellyth Valery, that Marcus Curius was
callid a man of grete witte, hardy and Chiualerous, and wel
gouernede the Empire.  to hym came messangers of a grete
Cite, and hym̄ founde Sittynge by a fyre vpon a lytill chaire,
ettynge of a tren dysshe, and hym Prait, yf hit were his
Plesynge endeynet to rescewe a grete Some of golde, that thay had
broght hym for har lordis.  This worthy lorde began to smothe
lagh, and answarid, "Say ye to youre lordys that hedyr you
sende, that Marcus Curius hath leuer to comaunde riche men
than be ryche; witte ye that y shall not be corruptid by
frendshup, enemyte, nethyr by golde, ne by Siluer."  For as Valery
Sayth, "euery good Emperoure loueth bettyr to be Powere in a
ryche Empire, than be riche in a pouer Empire."  And Seynte
Austyne Sayth, "that more is to playne that the Pouerte of
the Empire of Rome is Perishit, than the riches: For whyle
that the Prynces were Pouer the Pepill was riche, and when the
Prynces were riche the  Pepill was Pouer."  And therfor as vs
tellyth Eutropias, in the Stories of Romanes, That constance the
Emperoure in al his tyme desirid to make his Pepill riche, and
more-ouer, the same clerke vs tellyth, that bettyr is that riches
be in the handys of many men, than they in oone Place be
enclosyd; for the richere that the Pepill be, In So myche thay
may ham-Selfe the bettyr defende, and therto thay haue the
bettyr talent.  And who-so lytyll hath, the lasse talente hath;
<EPB/><PB N="178" ID="pb.178"/>
And therfor yf the <MILESTONE N="38L" UNIT="folio"/>Prynce Empoueryth the Pepill, he may
haue the lasse truste that the Pepill will helpe hym wyth
good will.  All the entente of good Prynces that euer were,
was to mayntene the prowe of the commyn pepill, for in that
dede thay trysted the bettyr to be lyke oure lord <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="folio"/>god, Kyng
of al Kynges, that al creaturis gouernyth aftyr Hare degre.
Therfore by gret study the lawes weryn stabelid and
mayntenyd̛, Marchaundises vsed, Dyuers moneis contreuet, and al
that myght bene y-sayde that good was, al was Purveyet to
the comyn Profite of the Pepill, and not to make riche the
Prynces; that wittnessyth al bokis that tretyth of Empires or
realmes.  Tully askyth, "yf the Sone shall Spare the fadyr yf
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.81"><FOREIGN>De patrie per amorem</FOREIGN>, MS.</NOTE1>he do any thynge agaynes the commyn Profite of the Contre."
Therto he hym-selfe answarith, "That fryst the Sone shall pray
the fadyr, that he wythdrawe hym, and yf he will not he shall
trete hym, and aftyr yf nede be, he shal acuse hym, and more
shall will that his fadyr be slayne, than the comyn Prowe of the
contre and the Peese be distourbet."  Of grete abstynence were
this olde Prynces, ffor at noone tyme he may be chyualryous, he
that Is a glotoune.  Of̘ this we redyth in gestis of Romanys,
that Cesar auguste, lorde of al the worlde was of grete
abstynence; he nad noo cure delicate mettis, but helde hym appayed
of commyn brede, and grete fleshis, and chese of the bugle, for
he wolde not yeue ensampill of delytes to chyualrie.  Glorie,
honoure, and noblesse, more desyryth prynces in olde tyme, than
hepis of golde, Siluer, or precious stonys.  Ensamples of thes
ben grete plente, but Sortely to passe ouer, hit suffichyth that
in the stories of Romanes we fyndyth y-writte, that oone forcible
kynge of grete Pouer, assiget the Cite of Rome.  Cruel assautes

makyd the Story of the conqueste by kynge Henry the Seconde
in Irland, tellyth that this Dermot in the begynnyge of his
regnacioune, he was an oppressoure and an extorcionere of vertues
men, and a crowel Tyraunt ontollerabill, vpon the grete lordis
of his londe.  Anothyr myschefe hym befell, O'rooryckes wyfe,
kynge of Mythe, by hyr owyn̄ assente, in abscence of hyr lorde,
he rauysshed.  And for-why that, for the more Partie al
myschefe, witnessynge olde stories many, and newe also, the wiche
by women began.  This kynge O'rorike, mor for shame than for
the hurte heyly grewid, wox al venomowsly wrothe.  And
therfor he gaderid many strangeris, that is to say, Rourike of
Connaght, that tyme kynge of Irlande, whyth his Pepill and
his owyn, A-vengid to ben̄e.  Than the grete lordis of laynyster,
Seynge har Prynce i-Putte to myschefe, and in euery Partie
vmbesegid wyth enemys, olde wronges that he hadd done ham
thay rehersid; thay rose al atte onys wyth his enemys, And So
fortvne and his Pepill hym lefte atte ones.  Than this Prynce
Dermot, Seynge hym-Selfe on euery Side besieget, wythout
helpe and fououre, and hugely ouersette with enemys, aftyr
many Sore battaillis, to the laste remedy, he flow ouer the See
into Normandy in the parties of Fraunce, to kynge henry the

was <MILESTONE N="41L" UNIT="folio"/>wirchiphully rescewid of the kynge, and hym his gouernaunce

fewtee, and hym toke his letteris of bienvoillaunce wher-by he
broght Pouer of Englyssℏ-men, Normanes, and Walschemen into

I-conquerid.  Thus did this Prynce Dermot hym̄-Selfe and al othyr
Prynces of his Nacion̄ in lond for euer encombre by oppressyon̄.<MILESTONE N="52" UNIT="folio"/>
And therfor Hit Is more Sure to euery Prynce to comaunde

For whate-euer man is y-lowid, hit semyth that he is dreddid.
But euery Extorcioner Is hatid of the commyn Pepill, and he that
hatid Is of the commyn Pepill, he shal be vnsocowrid whan he
moste nede hath, lyke as Dermot the Prince was.  I fynde In a
Sermonde writte, that an extorcionere is wors than the deuyll.
For the deuyll takyth in prei and turmentyth but corsyd men,
And the extorcioner rubbyth and Preyeth good men and trew;
And therfor the Deuil may Iustifye hym in rewarde of
extorcioner, For the Deuyl may Say to god, "I haue turmentid oonly
tho men that the haue hatid, but this extorcionere hath
turmentid tho men that the lowid."  And So we may vndyrstonde
that an extorcioner Is the deuyll-is angill, for thay ben sende

   us hir temporaly.  Capitulum. xxxvi.</HEAD><P>The loue and the dred of almyghty god, maker and fourmer
of al thing, frust aboue al thing preferid, xije causes
enduceth a man to loue his wif reissonnabli and tempora[t]li.  The
furste caus is for that holy writ so bidith: <FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">"Viri diligite
vxores vestras Sicut et Christus dilexit ecclesiam et Semet
ipsum tradidit pro ea"</HI1></FOREIGN>: That is to sey: "O ye men, loue your
wywis as crist lowith holy church, And hymself yaw for hit."
Therfor a man shold loue the helth of his wif bodely and
gostely; for why: criste diet for the helth of mannes Soull and
remissioun of his Sin, And therfor a man shold merciably
fforyew his wif repentaunt veraily hir trespace.  Vppon this matier
Seint Austeyn saith <FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">"Cur enim ad huc reputamus adulteros
quos credimus penitencia esse sanatos."</HI1></FOREIGN>  That is to sey —
"Why shold whe now hold men adulteours which whe trowith
with repentaunce I-maked hole."  The Secound caus that shold
enduce a man to loue his wif is, for hir body is the body of hir
spous, And therfor he shold loue hir body as his owyn bodi, for
the wif hath no pouer of hir owyn body.  The iije caus ys that
non of tham ys Sufficiant to bring forth fruyt alon of
Ieneracioun.  The iiij<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> caus is that woman of manys Ribe was fourmyt;
God wold not fourm woman of the Slyme as he dud man, but
of manys fleshe and bon, that he shold loue hir as him Self;
ffor holi writ saith, "whoso lowith his wif he lowith himself."
The ve caus is that a <MILESTONE N="47L" UNIT="folio"/>Man be-hettith woman loue when he Set
the Ring on hir fynger, and at mas in presence of cristes body
he doth kis hir.  The Sixt caus is that they ar cossinis both
of man and woman, for the vedlak louene euery ethir, And
therfor hit is wonder sethyn So many for ham lowen othir that
<EPB/><PB N="192" ID="pb.192"/>
thay hamself shold discord; ffor ofte tymys two realmes for on
matremony is broght to on accord.  The vije caus is that a wif
leuith fadir modir and all hir kyn, and anheyrryth to hir
spous, And therfor he doth ontreueli but yef he hir loue.  The
viije caus is that but yef they loue both othir thay shall be in
gret myssais, for lik as a man ne restith not well vndir a
dropping hous, namely in cold tym, So a man restith not with
his wif yf contencion be tham betwen.  The Philosofre saith,
<FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">"Vxor est aut perpetuale refugium aut perhenne
tormentum"</HI1></FOREIGN>: That is to sey, "A wif is a perpetuall refuyt, Othir an
euerlesting tormenty." the ixe caus is that hit is hugeli
pleasant to god, and man loue wedlak; for Salamon Saith, "In
thre thingis my spirit is pleassit, that ben aprowid afor god and
man; that is to sey the accord in brethereth, loue of
negheboris, And man and his wif well togeddir assentyng."  The xe
caus is that a wif is a solas to a man of godis yefte, And therfor
Salamon saith, <FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">"Ve Soli"</HI1></FOREIGN>; That is to sey, "Woo to hym that
is allon."  But he is not allon that livith in chastite, as oneste
maidenys and widowis vnto the worshup of god.  But a
fornicatour is hold allon which is acursid of god, that whan he seth
and covettith a woman fleshely, his dissolacion Radir þan <MILESTONE N="47bL" UNIT="folio"/>his
consolacioun he seth; he seth the swerd with the which the
dewill hym kittith and fro god hym departith.  The xie caus
that a wif is lik an ornement of an houshold; ffor Salamon
saith, <FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">"Sicut sol oriens in mundo in altissimo dei, Sic
mulieris bone species in ornamentis domus eius, et mulier
diligens corona<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.91">corana, MS.</NOTE1> est viro sou"</HI1></FOREIGN>; that ys to sey, "As the son
ryssing in the world in the heghest placis of god, So is the
fairnys of the woman gode in the ornamentis of hir hous; And
a lowing woman ys a croun to hir spous."  And Salamon,
speking of fairnys, saith, <FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">"Sapiens non corporis sed anime
respisit decorem."</HI1></FOREIGN>  That is to sey, "A wise man beholdith
not the fairnys of the body but of the soull."  And a fole in
flesly thyngis is ouer-taken.  The xije caus is that the sacrament
of matremony is a dingnite ordeyned of god and in paradis afor
that euer enny syn was wroght.  And therfor crist in the

auctorite of almyghty god, ordyner of matremony; <MILESTONE N="48L" UNIT="folio"/>And for honor
of the place that hit was maked In; ffor thereas Seint benet

ordir ys not nyowely maket, but of oldennys hit passith all
manner of orderis in erth, ffor hit was maked afor that euer

all the world was dront, only he sawid the ordir of matremoney.
In Noes ship he and his wif, har thre sonys and har wiffis
sawid were, but all the lechurreris and concubynes were drond.
The iiij<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> caus is for criste Ihesus and his modir Seint Mari and
his dessiplis by thare bodies presence —as Seint Iohn In his
gospell telith —wirsshuppeden at the feste of wedlok, and there
ettyn and dranken; but lechurris &amp; concubyns may not sayn
that euer criste or Seint mary his modir etten and dranken in
enny of thar houssys, But rather the deuyll, of whom thay
maked Sacrefiz of thare bodies.  The ve caus is for that our
lord Ihesus wold be born of oure lady Seint Mari in matremony.
Morouer hit is to wit that the work of matremony may be ussit
and don, as sarteyn tretis of wertius tellith, without anny <MILESTONE N="48bL" UNIT="folio"/>Syn

cheldryn to ben concewid, and to the wirship of god to be
broȝt fforth, with othir due sircumstancis accordyng to Reysoun:
This is the principall caus and office of the werk of matrimony.
The ije caus is whan that the work is don for remedy, that is to
wit to enchu fornicasion.  The iije caus is whan det is payed to
the asker; vppon the which matier Seint Austeyn saith thus:
<EPB/><PB N="194" ID="pb.194"/>
<FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">"Redde debitum coniugale nullus est criminis.  In hoc

hit is of no syn, rightfulnis meuyth in this caus the."  The
iiij<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1><NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.92">MS. iije.</NOTE1> case Is whan a man asketh that worke to mak his wif,
that she fal not in sin; as whan a man knowing his wif
shamfaste and neuer to ask that dette, and he dredith of hir
fallyng in Syn, he asketh that dette.  In this casse pite meuyth.
But sothely yef a man use that work to fulfill his concupiscens
ther is sin, othir while venyall syn and othir whill dedely
syn; hit is veniall sine whan concupiscence is so ferforth
subiecte to Reissoun, that he wold not know hir but yef she
wer his wif; hit is dedly syn whan that concupiscens Is so
vnmessurable that he wold knov hir thegh she wer not his wif.
Also hit is to wit that a worthy clerk, Iohn of Burghe, in a
bok which he maked, that is calit in latteyn <FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">"pupilla occuli

the dette of wedlak in an holy place, ffor so as sum men saith
the place myght be <MILESTONE N="49L" UNIT="folio"/>Polut.  But yef a man and his vif were
long tym in that place vyolenly enclossid, hit wer laffull to
tham to do that ded.  Also in hey festis &amp; solempne dayys, in
tymys of fasting and processiones a man and his wif shold not
neghe togedir, for in such solempne tymys specyaly honnoure is
to be don to god, And therfor Is to abstene fro leuefull
thingys, that thyng which is asked may be getten the mor
lyghtelier.  Natheles, who so is askede, he owith hit to pay, but
yef he may defer hit viesly and without pereill, but he shall not
aske hit in the forsaiden tymmys.  Therfor whoso asketh that

that the fryste Parte of the Profite of euery good worke, as
Parisiens Sayth, is glorie appertenynge to oure lorde god̛, And
ther-for the apostil sayth, "Honoure and glorie bene they vnto
you, oonly god."  The ije cause Is, that the Seconde Parte of
the Profite of euery good werke Is good ensampill, appertenynge
vnto oure neghbore; And therfor cryste in the gospel of Matheu
<EPB/><PB N="205" ID="pb.205"/>
Sayth, "Youre lyght so lyght afore men that thay mowen See
youre good workys."  The iije cause is that the thyrde Parte of
the Profite of a good worke Is a mede or rewarde appartenynge
vnto hym̄ that dooth good workys.  And therfor he that Sechyth
his owyn glori of good workes that he doth, he defraudyth god
of his Parte of the profite, and ther-for barnar vp this vers,
<FOREIGN><HI1 REND="b">Scuto circundabit te veritas eius,</HI1></FOREIGN> etc, Sayth, that vayn glorie
Is an arow of the deuyll that Is to drede, fleynge lyghtly in thy
lyfe-day, but hit makyth a full heuy and a full Soore wounde.
The iiij<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> cause why that this nobill erle sholde not haue vayne
glory of this forsayde proesses is, the lytill thanke that he had
of <MILESTONE N="57L" UNIT="folio"/>ham that hym shuldyn beste haue rewardid and commendid.
And ther-for this nobill erle may Sey that, that the appostill
Sayde vnto thymothe, "know thou," he Seyth, "that in the
latyste dayes ther shullyn be Perillous tymes, And men Shullyn
be lowynge ham-Selfe, couetous, Prowte, heygh, claundrynge,
inobedyente, and vnkynde wyth-all."  Of vnkyndnes spekyth
Seneca, and Sayth, "He is an onkynde man that denyeth hym
to haue recevid a good dede: He Is vn-kynde that feynyth: he
is vnkynde that rewardyth not ne commendyth benefactis, but
reportyth ille dedes: <MILESTONE N="58b" UNIT="folio"/>And He is moste vnkynde of all that

rewarde ne thanke anothyr for benefactes, neuer-the-lasse shulde
a man in any tyme cesse forto do al the good that he may.  For
the prophet biddyth, "Declyn̄e thou fro harme and do good."
