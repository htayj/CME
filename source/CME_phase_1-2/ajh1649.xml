And so folowith that Thomas was in the first case, and worthi to be blamed, as he was blamed of Crist.

But so it was in dede, that the apostlis tauȝten othere clerkis the ful al hool feith bi word<MILESTONE N="87a" UNIT="folio"/> sufficientli, and tho clerkis, so tauȝt of the apostlis, sufficientli tauȝten othere clerkis, succeding aftir hem, the same al hool feith, and that bi word sufficientli, and so forth contynuali into this present day. Wherfore, the al hool ful feith, bothe in the tyme of the apostlis, and alwey ever sithen, was groundid sufficientli in the clergie, for the tyme beyng and lyvyng, and bi the maner now seid teching and delyveryng. And thanne ferther it folowith thus.

Crist bade to hise apostlis, Mathew, the last chapiter, thus: <HI1 REND="i">Go ȝe therfore and teche ȝe alle folkis, baptising hem in the name of the Fadir, and of the Sone, and of the Holi Goost, teching hem to kepe alle thingis, what ever thingis y have co|maundid to ȝou;</HI1> and also, Mark the last c<HI1 REND="sup">r</HI1>., Crist bede to hise apostlis thus: <HI1 REND="i">Go ȝe into al the world and preche ȝe the gospel to every creature.</HI1> And anoon aftir, it is seid there thus: <HI1 REND="i">Thei, forsothe, goyng forth prechiden every where</HI1>. But so it is that the apostlis hadden not fulfillid this now seid comaundement, maad to hem bi Crist, in lasse than thei hadden prechid, bi word of mouthe sufficientli, al the hool feith necessarie to be had of the peple; forwhi, al the hool feith necessarie to be had, is includid in the gospel of God, that is to seie, in the message of God, which message God sent into the world. Wherfore, sothe it is that the apostlis prechiden bi word of mouthe, to othere clerkis and folkis, al the hool<MILESTONE N="88a" UNIT="folio"/> ful feith sufficientli; and so the secunde bifore maad principal premysse to be proved is trewe.</P><P>The iii<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> principal argument is this. If the apostlis hadden tauȝt manye clerkis, and manye of the laifolk, the hool al ful feith bi word of mouthe principali, and these clerkis and layfolk, survyvyng and over-lyvyng to the apostlis, hadden tauȝt, bi

But so it was in dede, that the apostlis tauȝten othere clerkis the hool ful feith, bi word principali, and tho clerkis so tauȝt of the apostlis bi word principali, tauȝten othere<MILESTONE N="88b" UNIT="folio"/> clerkis succeding to hem the same al hool feith, and that bi word principali, and so forth contynueli into this present day. Wherfore, the al hool feith, bothe in the tyme of the apostlis, and alwey sithen, was groundid principali in the clergie for the tyme beyng and lyvyng, and bi maner now seid teching and delyveryng. And thanne ferther it folowith thus: if the clergie for the tyme beyng, bi her now seid such teching and delyvering, was and is the principal ground for oure feith, for al tyme aftir the daies of the apostlis, it folowith at the fulle that forto loke aftir, or seche aftir, or seie Scripture to be the principal ground of our feith, or that Scripture schulde be a principal ground therof, and more necessarie and better grounding

The first premysse of this iii principal argument is pleyn ynouȝ to be trewe.<MILESTONE N="89a" UNIT="folio"/> And for proof of the ii<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> premisse of this iii<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> principal argument, may be maad the same argument which bifore is maad for proof of the ii<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> premysse, in the ii<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> principal argument, and that bi the there rehercid textis, of Mathew the last chapiter, and of Mark the last chapiter.</P><P>The iiii<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> principal argument is this. The chirche of Crist, which he foundid in erthe, and of which he is the heed, is alwey and al tymes oon and the same, as Seynt Poul witnessith, ad Eph. v<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> c.,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS62">The reference is from the margin.</NOTE1> where he seith that oon<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS63">MS. oo.</NOTE1> man to have bi the lawe oon wyf undepartabili, signifieth Crist to have oon chirche for his spouse. And the same witnessith the clergie, bi the profis or sequencis, whiche he singith in the masse of dedicacioun feest day, and in the viii<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> day of the same feest. And this same is comounli allegoriesed upon thilk text, Cant. vi<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> c.: <HI1 REND="i">Oon is my culum</HI1>. But so it was, that in the tyme of the apostlis, the chirche of Crist in erthe, bi his principal party, which was the clergie, was of so greet worthines,<MILESTONE N="89b" UNIT="folio"/> and auctorite, and dignite, that he thanne more 
<EPB/><PB REF="00000246.tif" SEQ="00000246" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNS" CNF="999" N="246"/> groundid the feith of Crist, than scripture groundid feith of Crist thanne. Forwhi the apostlis, thanne being the clergie of Cristis chirche, groundiden more Cristis feith than her writyng, maad and writen bi hem, groundid as thanne the same feith; in as moche as the effect of a cause doith not so moche into another effect, as doith the cause of the same effect into the same other effecte, aftir good philsophie. Wherfore it seemeth folowe that the chirche of Crist, now being, and at al tyme a this side the apostlis for the tyme being, is and was of lijk greet worthines, auctorite, and dignite, that he now more groundith the feith of Crist than Scripture groundith now the same feith. Sithen oon and the same chirche is now and thanne, and therfore, bi like skile, the same clergie of the chirche is now, which was thanne.</P><P>The v<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> principal argument is this. The clergie<MILESTONE N="90a" UNIT="folio"/> of the chirche dispensith with the thing which Holi Scripture forbedith. Forwhi, the pope ȝeveth leeve to a bigam, that is to seie, to a man that hath be twies weddid, forto be a dekene and a preest, notwithstonding that Holi Scripture forbedith it, i<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> Thi<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1>., 3<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> c<HI1 REND="sup">r</HI1>. But so it is that the lasse worthi refreyneth not the worthier, neither lowseth the bindingis of the worthier; wherfore the clergie of holi chirche is worthier, myȝtier, and of gretter auctorite, than is Holi Scripture, or at the leest the

The chirche of Crist, bi his cheef party the clergie, now and al tymes, hath power to expowne, declare, and inter|prete Holi Scripture, hou Holi Scripture oweth to be undirstonde, in the sense and undirstonding of God. But so it is that even peer hath not power into his even<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS64">MS. eeve.</NOTE1> peer, aftir the comoun wel<MILESTONE N="90b" UNIT="folio"/> allowid proverbe, neither the lasse worthi hath power over his worthier, as may be takun of Poul, Hebr. vii<HI1 REND="sup">o</HI1> capitulo,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS65">MS. a later addition.</NOTE1> where he seith that the lasse worthi is blessid of the more worthi.

Forwhi, a feith is not tauȝt to a peple sufficientli, but if it be tauȝt so that bi thilk teching thei mowe cleerli undirstonde al it, and esili reporte al it, and remembre al it, and kunne al it, perfitli and currauntli, and kunne reherce it, and talke it in a stable foorme of wordis,<MILESTONE N="93a" UNIT="folio"/>

And sotheli, forto speke of al the hool ful feith writen in the gospels and epistlis, it may not in this seid wise be tauȝt, without that it be write, and but if the writing therof be delyvered to the clergie.

And therfore, sithen neither the apostlis, neither eny othere clerkis, myȝten have tauȝt sufficientli the seid feith without scripture, and the peple myȝte<MILESTONE N="93b" UNIT="folio"/> not, bi studiyng in the scripture, have leerned without techers, it folowith nedis that Holi Scripture is more worthi ground of oure feith than is eny congregacioun of the clergie.

Also, longe bifore the flood of Noe, Ennok foonde lettris, and wrote bookis as the Maistir of Stories seith.

Wherfore it folowith that so wys men as weren the apostlis in goostli necessarie maters, and so fulfillid with the Holi Goost, and also wel putte into good avisis bi ful witti clerkis convertid into Cristen feith, knewen wel that this weie forto delyvere necessarie feith to peplis, bi word, and heering, and mynde oonly, without therof the writing, was insufficient to the peple.

The ii<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> premysse y may prove thus. In the daies of the greet and first Constantyne, emperour, ther was maad an universal counceil of al Cristen in

And that for as myche as to the more nede, remedie is rather to be ȝovun, than to the lasse nede. And the nede to putte tho articlis undir writing was ful greet, as schal soone aftir appere.
