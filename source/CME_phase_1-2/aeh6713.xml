OF THE LEAVEN OF PHARISEES.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>WITH regard to this tract, as with many that follow, I can give no decided opinion as to authorship. I find it monotonous and poor in style, but in substance it contains nothing that may not be Wyclif's, while there is so much of his characteristic teaching that it must be by one of his intimate disciples if not by himself. The reference to Bishop Spencer's crusade (p. 8) shows that it was written about 1383. In some parts it very much resembles the Fifty Heresies and Errors of Friars, printed by Mr. Arnold, No. XXIV. Compare especially pp. 14, 15, with Chapter XVII. of the Fifty Heresies (S. E. W. III. 280).</P><P>There is a lively description in Chap. III. of the tricks of the friars, which agrees well with Chaucer's description of his friar, whose</P><Q1><L>typet was aye farsed full of knyfes</L><L>And pynnes for to give faire wyfes.</L></Q1><P>The touch about their making friends with women by giving them pet dogs (p. 12) is, so far as I know, peculiar to this tract.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS.

HOW MEN OUGHT TO OBEY PRELATES. </HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>I DO not think this tract is by Wyclif. Its tone is not that of a man who has known the Court and been engaged in political affairs, but rather of some poor clergyman, who felt the burdens laid upon him by the bad government of the Church, and spoke from the bitterness of his personal experience. The extravagant expression, 'two or three thousand miles' (p. 30), points in the same direction. On the other hand, the text, 1 Cor. v. 5, is used here in the same way as in Prelates, No. IV. in this volume, and the warning against misusing the freedom given by God (p. 32) recalls a fine passage in the tract on Feigned Contemplative Life (No. X.).</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS.

It hinders men from doing the duties which God commands. Wickedness of prelates—their simony and other sins.

Excommunication often inflicted from spite.

THE RULE AND TESTAMENT OF ST. FRANCIS. </HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>THIS tract is distinguished among the many directed against the friars by its method of attack. The first and longer part consists merely in a translation of the rule by which the Franciscans admitted themselves bound, and the comment confines itself to pointing out how completely that rule was disregarded or evaded. The peculiar interest of the tract lies in its bringing before us how nearly in its idea the Franciscan order approached the body of poor priests, whom Wyclif sent out to preach. When the writer complains that at Rome "false menours" persecute those who would keep Francis' rule to the letter, we have an expression of the sympathy which we might have divined between the Lollards and the Spiritual Franciscans. (Cf. the Tract on the Leaven of Pharisees.) But before we have read to the end we find the author true to the "freedom of the gospel," which Wyclif consistently preached, declaring that no other order than Christ's is needed, since those who can carry out the highest and best life have that duty laid upon them by Christ's order to serve God with all their heart and all their strength. We may compare with this the saying (S. E. W. III. 452), "Every conseil of Crist is to sum man and sum tyme a precept."</P><P>I think that the author is Wyclif. The tract, Fifty Heresies of Friars, printed by Mr. Arnold (No. 24), seems like an amplification of this; and it is probably of later date, as the doctrine of transubstantiation is attacked there, but not mentioned here.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS.

OF PRELATES.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>THIS tract is less orderly in arrangement and fuller of repetition than is usual in Wyclif's work, but some parts of it are worthy of him, and it contains no opinions that are not to be found in his genuine writings. There is a great resemblance between this and the tract on the office of Curates, No. VII. Both have references to the Crusade in Flanders, and are therefore late works of Wyclif, if his at all; while both of them are silent as to his doctrine of the Eucharist, and are comparatively mild in their language as to the Friars, who are not treated as at all worse than the monks. This would be natural enough in Wyclif's earlier years, but is not in accordance with his usual tone after 1380. I incline to think that they were written by an intimate disciple rather than by the master.</P><P>As to evidence of date, I have little doubt that the mention of "anticrists bullis to maken cristene men to werre with each othere" (p. 73), and of pardons granted "to make discensioun &amp; werris" (p. 82) refer to Spencer's Crusade, although it is just possible that they may point to one of the other occasions on which popes have encouraged bloodshed.</P><P>The tone as to persecution is uncertain. The passage (p. 87) "prisonen hem and slen hem <HI1 REND="i">algates in wille</HI1>" looks as if the infliction of death for heresy was not yet allowed. There is stronger language in the Sermons and the Trialogus. Yet we are told on p. 79, that lords who support poor priests are cursed and taken to prison "if thei stonden sadde in goddis cause." This may have happened in Wyclif's time, merely as the result of excommunication, but I know no instance of it. Were the tract written much after his death, its tone would probably be fiercer.</P><P>I cannot identify the "litel harlot" who "dispiseth the pope and stroieth his lordship," p. 83.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS.

HOW THE OFFICE OF CURATES IS ORDAINED OF GOD.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>I HAVE already said (in the Preface to No. IV.) that I think this tract to be by another hand than Wyclif's, but the tone of thought is very like his. The date of it is evidently after 1383, as Bishop Spenser's crusade in Flanders is mentioned as a thing of the past (Chapter XVI.).</P><P>When we read the complaint (Chap. XXII.) of the clergy who leave their parishes and go to school (that is, of course, to the University), in order to lead a loose life there, we are not suppose that the writer had any dislike to the Universities. Oxford was a chief centre of Wyclifite influence, and Wyclif himself, in 1368, received from his bishop two years' leave of absence from his living (Fillingham) to study at Oxford, where, our tract tells us, "good priests traveilen faste to lerne goddis lawe." Its author had rubbed shoulders with the men who went to study "Civil and Canon," and did little good thereat, or at most learned to "crack a little Latin in Consistories." The scholar is as indignant against fast men who degrade the seat of learning, as the reformer against priests who neglect their parishes. We may suppose the writer to be one of Wyclif's Oxford friends—perhaps Herford or Purvey.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS. X. and collated with the Dublin MS.

OF FEIGNED CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>I THINK this is an early work of Wyclif's. It is certainly higher in tone and better in style than many in this volume. Especially to be noticed is the passage on p. 193, where the author, after inveighing against the heavy burden of ritual ordinances laid upon priests, returns upon himself with the warning that men must not abuse the freedom to which he exhorts them by making it an excuse for sloth, for that is the devil's snare. So, too, the complaint (p.194) that priests lead a lower life than their conscience dictates, for fear of hurting the sick conscience of their brethren, is a touch finer than is common in these polemical papers. How often may Wyclif's impetuous exhortations to revolt have been parried by such considerations as these?</P><P>The scribe who wrote the Corpus MS. (X.) made a curious blunder with this tract, as has been pointed out by Mr. Arnold, S. E. W. III. 507. Owing most likely to the displacement of some leaves in the MS. from which he copied, he transferred the last part of this tract to the end of "A Petition to the King and Parliament," while bringing the last part of the Petition to the end of this. As is often the case with him, he passed over the junction in happy unconsciousness that he was writing nonsense.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS. X. and collated with the Dublin MS.

THE AVE MARIA.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>I HAVE no doubt of the genuineness of this tract. The tone and manner are Wyclif's, and the invective against the frivolity of the gentry suits better a man who had lived at court than one of the obscure poor preachers. Besides the general style there is one passage which bears a special mark of Wyclif. On page 208 we are told, "God the Trinity is with each creature . . . to keep it; for else it should turn to naught." The belief of the immanence of God in all created things is one which Wyclif held firmly. (Cf. Cum ergo in qualibet creatura est Trinitas increata.—Trial, iv. 27.) The doctrine was brought into popular use in his latest controversies on the Eucharist, but used as it is here, in a different connexion and in|cidentally, it is a sign of the hand of the master rather than one of his pupils.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS.

Prof. Brewer's preface to Monumenta Franciscana, pp. xliii-xlvi). The same charge is made in the tract Of the Leaven of Pharisees. The abuse of bishoprics <HI1 REND="i">in partibus infidelium</HI1> conferred on men who only desire episcopal orders for the profit to be made of them at home (No. 40) is, I think, mentioned nowhere else in this volume.

It was written soon after the Wat Tyler riots, when Wyclif and his followers were discredited by a supposed complicity with John Ball (cf. Wals. II. 33). The indignant disclaiming of Socialist doctrine is fearlessly combined with denunciation of the oppressions committed by the rich. The complaint that "lords strive with their tenants to bring them into thraldom more than they should by reason and charity" (p. 234), is a proof, if one were needed, of the kind of in|justice which led to the revolt. The author had lived among the poor and been an eye-witness of oppression, or he would not have insisted with such force on the need of the lord's presence to control the extortions of his steward (p. 240), nor should we have had the touch of the white (tally) sticks, which the poor were made to accept for their goods (p. 233).</P><P>The distinction between refusing tithes to wicked priests and withhold|ing dues from wicked lords or creditors, is clearly stated on pp. 229-230.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS.

In the Trialogus we find complaints that sacraments are multiplied so as to be a burden to the Church, and Confirmation and Extreme Unction are said not to have enough ground in Scripture to be necessary to salvation (<HI1 REND="i">Trial</HI1>, book iv. chapters xi., xiv., xxv.). His doctrine of dominion is brought in on p. 247. Perhaps we may see a touch of personal feeling in the statement that a curate cannot get leave of absence to study God's law without payment. Had Wyclif found it necessary to buy leave to absent him|self from Fillingham in 1368?</P><P>On the other hand, the tone of several passages would lead us to attri|bute them to one of the poor priests rather than to Wyclif. It seems unlikely that the rector of Lutterworth would speak of a man who accepted a cure as binding himself "to o synguler place as a tey dogge," p. 252.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS.

It seems to have been written when the controversy with the poor priests had been carried on some time, and when they found it necessary to justify their constant appeals to God's law (Talem enim habebant terminum in omnibus suis dictis, semper prætendendo legem Dei; Goddis lawe, Knighton 2664.)

In complaining of the manner in which Scripture was wrested to all ends by setting aside its literal sense, Wyclif was insisting on a favourite topic. It is curious, however, to find him maintaining the right of preaching against wicked men by name, since, so far as I know, there is no personal attack in any of his works; the nearest approach to it being his allusions to Spencer's action in heading the Flanders Crusade. It is possible, having regard to the context, to suppose that he means only class names (such as 'prelates,' 'friars,' etc.). He may have been taxed with want of charity in attacking special classes, instead of confining himself to a general denunciation of sin. It seems that in any case his attacks were returned.</P><P>Copied from the Corpus MS. X. and collated with the Dublin MS. AA.</P><P><TABLE><HEAD>SUMMARY.</HEAD><ROW><CELL>CHAP.

TRACTATUS DE PSEUDO-FRERIS.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>I REGARD this tract as almost certainly Wyclif's, and in this I am sup|ported by Mr. Arnold's opinion, who omitted it only because he had printed so much invective against the Friars. It has an interest as showing that Wyclif felt it necessary to justify his attacks upon the Mendicants, though it must be owned that the apology takes the form of a renewal of the offence. But we must not disregard the 'pseudo' which forms part of the title, and is not forgotten in the text. What Wyclif inveighed against is the evil which followed from admitting and binding to an order men who did not live in the spirit of its founder. With a true follower of St. Francis Wyclif would have had much in common. Even as it was, he admits there were good men among them: as Paul and Nicodemus were among the Pharisees, to whom he delighted to liken them.</P><P>This higher temper may be noticed in his dealing with the practice of midnight prayers (p. 317). Such rising to pray he says may be good, or it may be a hindrance to a man whom God calls to some better occupation, and it is presumptuous to make a binding rule on the subject. So in his Latin sermons he says, "Non observant omnia que Christiana religio precipit et observat, cum non observant mensuram" (MS. Trin. Coll. Camb. fo. 195). Of his rougher humour there is a good specimen on p. 319, where he likens friars between whom there is ill-feeling to dogs in a sack.</P><P>Among the marks of authenticity we may note the incidental use of the doctrine of Dominion (p. 316) and of Wyclif's favourite point that it is impossible to tell of any man whether he will be saved or damned (p. 317). Another characteristic passage is that on p. 312: "We graunten mekeliche that . . . we faylen in the heyghnesse of charite." Wyclif knew that his besetting fault was intemperance in attack. In a passage quoted by Dr. Shirley (F. Z. xlv. note) he tells us that he was accused of vindictive|ness and spite; and in the tract De Sex Jugis (Lechler ii. 603) he says: "Omnes enim cogitamus superflue, quomodo vindicta caperetur de hostibus Christi atque ecclesiæ, et potius cogitamus imprecando istam vindictam quam alia media misericordiæ, quæ sic injuriantibus cederent ad salutem."</P><P>I must not omit to notice that this sharp attack on the Friars contains no mention of the Eucharist, but I cannot on that account disregard the weighty reasons in favour of its genuineness.</P><P>Copied from the only MS., Dublin, C. v. 6.

THE CLERGY MAY NOT HOLD PROPERTY.<LB/>WITH AN APPENDIX ON THE WRONGFULNESS OF THEIR UNDERTAKING SECULAR WORK.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>No external evidence authorizes us to attribute this tract to Wyclif. It does not even derive credit from being bound up with other works believed to be his, since it fills the little volume in which only it is found.</P><P>Dr. Shirley admitted it to his catalogue on the ground of style, and it is only on that ground, and for its general consonance with Wyclif's habits of thought, that it can be ascribed to him. I find it very difficult to arrive at a decided opinion. On the one hand, it is more orderly and less vivacious than most of Wyclif's pamphlets; with scarcely any of his characteristic outbursts of lament over abuses or invectives against those who practise them. It relies more, too, on citations of authorities than is his custom. On the other hand, there are passages that look like his work, such as (p. 368) the story of the bishop who looked forward to the time when the gentry should be the hired soldiers of the Church, and the warning (p. 372) that when the clergy have once got power, "the secular party may go pipe with an ivy-leaf," (otherwise whistle for) the return of any part of it.</P><P>In substance the tract is purely Wyclifite, but it has no trace of his latest developments. If it is by the master, it must be one of the earliest compositions in this volume, as it has much more likeness to his writings of 1365-1375 than to those of his latest years. The difference will be strongly felt if it is compared with the Supplementum Trialogi, which deals with the same subject.</P><P>Copied from the Lambeth MS. (LL).

Of þis þan þu mayst se houȝ god in alle his lawis haþ sufficiently ordend for alle þe statis þat he foundit and aproued. And houȝ it were aȝens þe goodnes and þe wisdome of god to orden eny state but if he ordend sufficyent liflode þerto. Siþ þen þis ordenance of god was sufficyent, als welle for þe clergi as for oþer men, it semiþ a foule presumpcyon to brynge in a new and a contrary ordenance of liflode for clerkis, vp-on þat ordenance þat crist had made for hem by-fore. Of þe whiche ordenance þe clergy fulle many yere aftir þe bi|gynnynge of cristis chirche, whan it was best gouernyd, helden hem a-payde. For þis meneþ þat cristis <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="page"/>ordenance was insufficyent &amp; worthi to be vndo. And if we take goode heede, þai hadden no more nede to plene hem of þis orde|naunce þan hadden þe oþer two statis of his chirche, þe whiche in-to þis day holden hem apayde wiþ þis ordenance of criste, and desyren in grete party þat þis fayre and sufficient ordenaunce of criste were fully kepte. And more sikirnes or ensurance may no man make of eny-þinge þan criste haþ of þis liflode to þe clergy. For crist not oonly affermiþ to þe peple þat he wille not fayle hem in liflode &amp; helynge, but also preueþ þis by argumentis þat may not be asoylyd, so þat þai be true seruandis to hym. For crist meniþ þus in his arguynge þer: "Siþ god fayleþ not briddis<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1302">Matt. vi. [26.]</NOTE1> <MILESTONE N="40b" UNIT="page"/>and lilyes and grasse þat growen in þe felde, neiþer heþen men, hou myche raþer schal he not fayle his true seruandis." And so þis purvyance of perpetual almes, þat oure clerkis speken of, meniþ fawte of bileue &amp; dispeire of þe gracious gouernance of god. Siþ þan, as it is sayde bifore, it is noone almes to releue oo wreche and make an oþer or mo; and to make hem riche wiþ temporalle lordeschip, þe whiche ben forfendit to siche peple; and namely if siche almes-ȝevynge be distroynge or apeyrynge of eny state aprevyd of god in his chirche, it wille sue þat þe endowynge of þe clergy wiþ worldly lordeschipe owȝt not to be callid almes, but raþer alle a mysse, or wastynge of goddis goodes, <MILESTONE N="41" UNIT="page"/>or distroynge of his

For whi þis almes þat clerkis speken of here made many wrechis, And it was ȝoue to hem þat hadde no nede. And þus it is enpeyringe not oonly of oone estate of þe chirche, but of alle þre, of þe whiche I spoke of in þe bigynnynge. And so þis almes-ȝevynge haþ made alle owre rewme, ȝhe, &amp; as I suppose, fulle nye all crestyndome, full pore and nedy and myscheuous ouer þat it schuld have be if þe clergy had holde hem payde wiþ cristis ordenance.

And þerfore þer may noon oþe or a-vow bynde eny man to mayntene þis þefte and distryinge of goddis ordenance, and þis greete harmynge of cristis chirche, as þe vow of iepte<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1303">Judges xi.</NOTE1> schulde not have bounde <MILESTONE N="42" UNIT="page"/>him to kille &amp; to sacrifice his owne douȝter.

Et deus de sua bonitate nunc primo incipit audire ecclesiam suam, et misit adiutorem suum, scilicet terram, que absorbere vult totum flumen; vel principem terrenum, qui vult auferre ab ecclesia omnia temporalia sua, licet intencio non eadem sit cum domino, qui propter bonum ecclesie mittit illum ex misericordia. hec ille.

Et quia et ipse pars domini est, et dominum partem habet, talem se exhibere debet, ut ipse possideat dominum et possideatur a domino. Qui enim dominum possidet, et cum propheta dicit: pars mea dominus, nichil extra dominum possidere potest; nam si quippiam aliud habuerit preter dominum, pars eius non erit dominus. verbi gracia, si aurum, si argentum, si possessionem, si variam suppellectilem habuerit, cum istis partibus dominus pars eius fieri non dignatur.

Each, however, contains chapters which are not in the other, while in details of treatment and in language they are independent. In this case, as in his defence of the Conclusions condemned in 1377, Wyclif has published his argument in two forms intended to appeal to different classes of readers; and we cannot doubt that, in this instance as in that, both forms were issued simultaneously or nearly so. Dr. Lechler in his preface dates the Latin tract not later than 1378, and his judgment is supported by the mention (p. 457) of Avignon as the residence of the Pope; since Gregory XI., the last of the Avignonese Pontiffs who was recognized in England, died March 27, 1378. This English version of the tract is much more vehement against the friars than the Latin; although even that, by the use of the phrase 'castra caymitica,' shows that Wyclif had already taken up a position of settled hostility to the Mendicant Orders.</P><P>Copied from the Ashburnham MS.

DE PAPA.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>I HAVE no doubt that this tract is genuine. Besides the presump|tion in its favour from its occurrence in the Ashburnham MS., the internal evidence is very strong. Not only the views are Wyclif's; the arguments and illustrations are such as he frequently uses in his authentic writings. Thus the mention of a cord and a man's neck (p. 476), as examples of things good in themselves that may be bad in combination, is to be found also in the Trialogus (p. 306).</P><P>The date of the tract is probably about 1380. The reference to the doctrine of Transubstantiation shows that Wyclif had already made up his mind on this point, but the Schism is spoken of (Chapter II.) in a tone which implies that it was still recent. Spencer's Crusade was not yet on foot, or we should have had some notice of it.</P><P>How far Wyclif had gone in opposition to the formal organization of the Church is shown by his assertion (Chapter v.) that neither tonsure, dress, nor bishop's words make the priest, but power given by Christ. The development of the same thought in Chapter XI. shows that this is no hasty outburst, but a deliberate expression of opinion.</P><P>Copied from the Ashburnham MS.
