Buckland, of Edgcott, Northamptonshire.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.1">

From bishop John Chedworth's Register at Lincoln,
lf. 55 to lf. 56.  In the same Register, at lf. 84 bk. to 85 bk., is a
second copy of this will.  In this second copy the surname always
appears as 'Bokeland'; and the verb 'wol', or 'woll', is generally
'will', but sometimes 'wyll'.  The chief other variants of the second
copy are given in the footnotes.  Some slight clerical errors in the
first copy have been corrected from the second copy without
comment.</NOTE1><P>This Dame Buckland was a notable housemistress, and her enumeration
of, and division of, her household and personal effects are pleasingly
minute and distinct.</P><P>One of her phrases invites a note, since it
touches on a point as to bed-linen which occurs in several other of
these wills, but is now practically forgotten.  Linen was then woven
in a long narrow web, incapable of providing a sheet of sufficient
width for any ordinary bed.  The usual practice was to take three
lengths from such a web and sew them together at their edges so as to
form a sheet of the desired width.  This arrangement had the
advantage, from the point of view of household economy, that, when the
middle strip grew thin by use, the long seams could be unpicked, and
one of the less worn side-strips put in the middle, removing the
original middle-strip to the edge.  When this fresh middle-strip
became thin in its turn, it changed places with the other side-strip.
Each of these strips was called, in English, a 'leaf', or a 'breadth';
in Latin, <FOREIGN LANG="lat">a folium</FOREIGN>.  Dame Buckland uses
'leaf'.  Half-widths occur; e.g. sheets of 'two leaves and a half',
some apparently for coverlets, others for narrower beds.  Ancient beds
were constructed for two, or even several, persons sleeping
together. Shakespeare, in <HI1 REND="i">Twelfth Night</HI1>, mentions
the then proverbial 'great bed of Ware', in Hertfordshire, which
required a sheet of twelve feet square.</P><EPB/><PB N="38" ID="pb.2"/><P>Dame Bucklands's bequests include four service-books, catalogued,
in the way then in universal use, by the first words of the recto of
their second leaf.  Such books, to begin their first leaf, had
generally a more or less elaborate illumination, so that the first
words of the second leaf supplied a simpler distinctive mark by which
to recognize them.</P><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:1.1.1" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.3"><MILESTONE N="55" UNIT="leaf"/><HEAD><FOREIGN LANG="lat">Testamentum Iohanne Buckland.</FOREIGN></HEAD><P><FOREIGN LANG="lat">In dei Nomine, Amen</FOREIGN>: in the yere of

lf. 46 bk.  This document is in a somewhat difficult hand, and the
reading in some words is quite doubtful.  A feature of the deed is the
abandonment of the old þ, to make use of 'y'.  The testator
disposes of a noteworthy collection of relics, of several devotional
books, and of a MS. of Chaucer's <HI1 REND="i">Canterbury Tales</HI1>.
The devotional books seem to have partly come from religious houses
(Grace Dieu priory in Leicestershire, and an unnamed<EPB/><PB N="45" ID="pb.9"/>
Friary).  Special mention is made of a Latin Psalter (David sauter);
of Walter Hilton's (died 1396) <FOREIGN>de vita contemplativa et activa</FOREIGN>, or, at
least, of the second part of it; and of <FOREIGN>de vita Christi</FOREIGN>, possibly the
treatise by Ludovicus de Saxonia, but see Bonaventura's <HI1 REND="i">Speculum vitae Christi</HI1> (as noticed in <HI1 REND="i">Oseney
English Register</HI1>, E.E.T.S., 1913, p. ix.)  Some slight
peculiarities of the hand have been purposely omitted, e.g. a sort of
contraction mark over will, several false starts, and a flourish at

Essex, in a Court held in Romford chapel, Essex, Susan Clarke of
Barking, Essex, accused of bigamy, produced a certificate from
householders of Tattershall, Lincolnshire, that her pretended husband
… Bowlt, and also her pretended husband … Gryse, had
both of them wyves lyving when they maryed with Susan: and afterwards,
and by due order of lawe, she was separated from them both.  She
produced also a certificate that her husband, William Clarke, was
recently deceased.  The charge was withdrawn.</P><P>3 May, 1592:
before the Official of the Archdeacon of Essex, in a Court held in
Ingatestone church, Essex, John Wylson of Laindon Hills, was ordered
to bring a certificate of his marriage with Joan Streates; and to
answer the charge that, at the time of that marriage, he had another
wif lyvinge.</P><P>5 May, 1592, Richard Weston, of Sutton, Essex, was
brought into the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held at Maldon,
because suspected to have two wives alive, and not lawfully maryed to
her that he now kepeth.  His defence was that his first wife (Ellen
Browne) had died at Fulham beyond London.</P><P>24 April, 1593, Jaspar
Harman, of Grays Thurrock, Essex, was prosecuted in a Court of the
Archdeacon of Essex held in Romford chapel, on the charge that he hath
ii. wyves.  His plea was: about xvi. yeres agone he was married in
Eastwood church, Essex, to Margaret Battell, with whom he continued
about 10 or 12 yeares; and since that time, about a yeare last past,
he was married in Rushmore parish church, neare vnto Ipswich in

seventh baron Lovel of Tichmarsh, whereby provision was made for the
foundation of a two-priest chantry-chapel in the Greyfriars Convent,
Oxford, and there was laid down a complicated entail of testator's
estates among his four sons and their heirs male.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.10">From bishop John Chedworth's Register at Lincoln, lf. 22 bk. to
lf. 26.  The estate was a large and complicated one; and the ultimate
division of its members, under entail, between testator's four sons
was far from simple.  The intention of the will and codicils is also
greatly obscured by the absence of information as to the most
important item of the demise, viz.  the estates settled on testator's
eldest son (his successor in his baronies).</NOTE1><P>The Lovel family was by origin of Minster Lovel, Oxfordshire.
According to the <HI1 REND="i">Peerages</HI1> accessible to me, the
testator, Williamn Lovel, at the age of 17, succeeded his father John
Lovel (6th baron), in 1414, as 7th baron Lovel (of Tichmarsh,
Northamptonshire), and was summoned as a baron to Parliament from 1425
to 1453.  He also succeeded his father in the barony of Holland (or
Holand), which had been brought into the Lovel family by the marriage
of Maud, granddaugther and heiress of Robert de Holland, 2nd baron
Holland (1342-73), to John, 5th baron Lovel, testator's grandfather.
The barony of Burnell, to which the testator here asserts his claim,
seems to have been without official recognition.  Edward Burnell,
first baron Burnell, was summoned to Parliament 1311 to 1314, but died
1315, leaving his sister Maud as his heiress.  At his death the barony
of Burnell became, in law, extinct.  Maud Burnell married, as her
first husband, John Lovel, 2nd baron Lovel of Tichmarsh, who died
1314; and as her second husband, Sir John Haudlo, summoned to
Parliament as baron Haudlo 1342.  By one of the perplexing intricacies
of the Peerage writs, the summonses to Parliament, 1350-1420, directed
to baron Burnell, were sent to Maud Burnell's descendants by her
second marriage, but the Lovel family seems to have obstinately, in
word at least, persevered in its claim to the title.</P><P>The whole proceeding can best be understood by a rough pedigree:</P><EPB/><PB N="71" ID="pb.35"/><P><FIGURE></FIGURE></P><P>The Peerage problems are worked out in the larger modern <HI1 REND="i">Peerages</HI1>.  All that concerns us here is to note that
these accumulated peerages brought into the Lovel family not only the
ownership of the estates of those baronies, but also according to the
ideas of the age, the obligation to provide and maintain intercessory
services for members of the extinct families (supra 68/20).  Hence,
testator's intense desire for a perpetual two-priest chantry.</P><P>William Lovel, 7th baron Lovel, by a marriage which reminds us of
the epigram Tu, felix Austria, nubes, had brought into his family,
besides the two baronies he inherited, and the<EPB/><PB N="72" ID="pb.36"/>
barony he claimed, two other baronies.  He had, therefore, an
exceptional number of manors to dispose of in his will.  If we had
access to his marriage-settlement, we should probably find that it
directed him to entail certain of his wife's manors on their younger
sons.</P><P>The foundation of this chantry-chapel might well be used as a
foot-note appended to a lament over the vanity of human wishes, as
expressed in the telling lines of Robert Burns:<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L ID="l.1">The best laid schemes o' mice an' men</L><L ID="l.2">Gang aft agley.</L></Q1></P><P>Greyfriars Convent in Oxford, by the fame of Roger Bacon, was the
best-known house of the Order in England.  Its church was one of the
greatest.  But, at the Dissolution, it was so completely destroyed,
that all memory of the Lovel chapel was rooted out.  Anthony Wood (<HI1 REND="i">City of Oxford</HI1>, ii. 383), making his list of eminent
persons buried in this church, has no mention of William, Lord Lovel.
The fact was first brought to light by Alfred Gibbons in his list of
<HI1 REND="i">Early Lincoln Wills</HI1>, 1888.  Even the admirable
monograph on <HI1 REND="i">The Grey Friars in Oxford</HI1>, by
A. G. Little (O.H.S. 1892) could only add (p. 106) that in the
arrangements made by lord Lovel for his burial here 'a bequest would
no doubt be included'.  Railway cuttings, botanists tell us, often
bring back to a district plants long extinct there, and so now
Dr. Furnivall's research has brought to light this long-forgotten
Lovel chantry in Oxford.</P><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:1.8.1" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.23"><MILESTONE N="22 bk." UNIT="leaf"/><HEAD>[I. Full Text of the Will.]<LB/>

God.</ITEM><ITEM>2. Pilgrimages ought not to be made to places where the bodies of
saints rest.  The expenditure incurred in such pilgrimages is wasted,
and the toil undergone is profitless.</ITEM><EPB/><PB N="93" ID="pb.57"/><ITEM>3. A child whose parents have been baptized has no need of baptism,
and ought not to be baptized, since its parents' baptism is sufficient
for it.</ITEM><ITEM>4. Laymen who are married or who are engaged in manual labour are
not bound to fast.  Christ is nowhere found to have instituted
fastings of this sort.  The Canonical Rule of the Church put forward
in this respect is binding only on clerics and on inmates of convents.</ITEM><ITEM>5. To bury a corpse in consecrated ground does the soul of the dead
person no more good than if the corpse had been thrust into a bog.
The solemnities of funerals were invented to provide fees for
money-loving priests.  It would be better if funeral expenses went in
alms to the poor than to enrich priests.</ITEM><ITEM>6. A priest has no more power to make 'the body of Christ' than the
wheat-stalk has.  After the words of consecration the bread remains
only bread as before; and, in fact, is debased by having had such
spell-words pronounced over it.</ITEM><ITEM>7. Thirty breads of this sort are sold for one halfpenny, but
Christ was sold for thirty pence.  The sacrament after this fashion is
therefore a figment devised to enrich priests.</ITEM><ITEM>8. Confession made to a believer of the Lollard sect is more
soul-healing than confession made to a priest.</ITEM><ITEM>9. Inasmuch as God is the searcher of all hearts and the knower of
all secrets, an unspoken prayer is just as good as a spoken prayer,
and a prayer made in a field or other unconsecrated place is just as
efficacious as if it were made in a church.</ITEM><ITEM>10. The sole requisite for a valid marriage is mutual consent
between the man and the woman, and no other solemnity is needed to
justify their living together as man and wife.  The marriage-service
was brought in solely to provide fees for priests.</ITEM><ITEM>11. Extreme unction does not benefit the soul of any man.  The only
result of this anointing ('greasing,' we call it in English) is to
dirty and make vile the person's body.</ITEM><ITEM>12. The Pope is Antichrist; priests are the disciples of
Antichrist.  All persons in Holy Orders are incarnate devils.</ITEM><ITEM>13. Every human being is called 'the church of God'.  Therefore, if
any Lollard is brought before the judge of an ecclesiastical court and
required to answer the question Dost thou believe in the Church?  he
may answer without scruple I do; since by his belief in the Church he
states only that he believes in man, who is 'the temple of God'.</ITEM><ITEM>14. Each of the accused publicly admitted that, in a large meeting
of Lollards, he had solemnly taken oath upon the Bible (i) that he
would use his utmost diligence to bring into the Lollard sect as many
as ever he could prevail upon, and (ii) that he would reveal to no
outsider the existence of the sect or the names of its adherents until
they were strong enough in numbers to destroy Antichrist and all
Antichrist's disciples; and this (he at that time asserted) would soon
be.</ITEM></LIST></DIV4><EPB/><PB N="94" ID="pb.58"/><DIV4 NODE="LinDDoc:1.11.1.3" TYPE="notes" ID="DIV4.38"><HEAD>[Notes on the preceding Articles.]</HEAD><P>1. That a man with outstretched arms is 'an image of God' seems to
be a Lollard exposition of Gen. i. 27, 'God created man in his own
image.'</P><P>A gift of money to a particular image, or to an altar dedicated to
a particular saint in a church, was a recognized act of devotional
charity.  In many cases, a donor silently left a coin on the pedestal
of the image or on the altar, just as nowadays a charitable visitor
drops a coin into an alms-box in a church.  At one time, it is on
record that such offerings were of appreciable value.  When
Westminster Abbey, on 21 October, 1356, impropriated the rectory of
Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, special covenant was made that 'all
oblations in any wise so ever offered to the image of the Blessed
Mary' in that church should go to Westminster Abbey, not to the vicar
of Sawbridgeworth.</P><P>Lincoln College accounts have these notes in respect of this custom
at All Saints Church, Oxford:

St. Anne.</ITEM><ITEM>1510, June, a stranger woman offered 1d. at the image

Becket at Canterbury had (1383), long before this, provided Chaucer
with the framework of his <HI1 REND="i">Canterbury Tales</HI1>.
Huntingdonshire folk were probably more familiar with the pilgrimage
to Walsingham in Norfolk.  At Little Walsingham there was a chapel
dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, beside which was a spring
(St. Mary's well or the Holy well).  A cross stood on a stone slab
under the edge of this spring.  Here pilgrims knelt, while they
secretly wished for what they wanted, and afterwards threw a piece of
gold on the slab — <HI1 REND="i">A Description of England and
Wales</HI1> (1769), iv. 266.  A popular tune ('Walsingham') took its
title from this pilgrimage: Clark's <HI1 REND="i">Shirburn Ballads</HI1>
(1907), p. 245.  Foreign pilgrimages, taken (at this period) to
Compostella in Spain, to Triers or Cologne, or the Santa Casa at
Loretto in Italy, were both toilsome and costly.</P><P>3. In their teaching as to the sacrament of baptism, these<EPB/><PB N="95" ID="pb.59"/>
Lollards took up an exaggerated 'Traducian' position.  In orthodox
doctrine it was maintained that original sin was transmitted from
parents to child.  The Lollards maintained that, in like manner, the
grace conferred by baptism was transmitted from baptized parents to
child.  Baptism, in such cases, was therefore superfluous, since the
grace it was supposed to confer had been inherited at birth.</P><P>4. The official canons of the Church, after some centuries of
varying practice, had finally appointed, as of obligation, abstinence
from flesh and fowl on Fridays and Wednesdays weekly; on the vigils
(or eves) of Sundays and Festivals; on Saturdays (as well as on
Wednesdays and Fridays) in the Ember weeks; and, especially, during
the forty days of Lent.  Transgressions of these fasts were sedulously
sought out by the officials of the Ecclesiastical Courts, and the
transgressors brought into Court and punished, often severely.  The
Lollard position was that these rules ought not to be imposed on the
laity.  It was perhaps emphasized by an exposition of
St. Matt. ix. 14, 'thy disciples fast not.'</P><P>5. Burial within the walls of a church meant a considerable fee
(latterly 6s. 8d.) to the rector of the parish, if the grave were in
the chancel; to the churchwardens, on the parish account, if it were
elsewhere in church.  A grave in the churchyard meant a small fee to
the churchwardens.  There were also the fees of the parish-priest, the
parish-clerk, and the ringer of the knell at the actual funeral.  See
the lease of All Saints Church, Oxford, 1539, and the notes about that
church in the Forewords.</P><P>6. The Lollard position as regards Transubstantiation, a dogma made
obligatory by the first Lateran Council, 1215.</P><P>7. An attempt at a <FOREIGN LANG="lat">reductio ad absurdum</FOREIGN>
argument.  If the host were the body of Christ it should be worth,
even at Judas's valuation, 30 silver-pennies (St. Matt. xxvi. 15), how
then could a wafer be the body of Christ when it could be bought for
1-60d.?</P><P>8. Apparently the Lollard exposition of St. James v. 16: 'Confess
your faults one to another.'</P><P>9. 1 Chron. xxviii. 9; well known because taken into an
introductory Collect in the Ordinary of the Mass in the use of Sarum,
whence it has passed into the Anglican service-book.</P><P>10. This tenet fixed itself firmly in the minds of the lower<EPB/><PB N="96" ID="pb.60"/>
people.  In Elizabeth's reign and later the Archdeacons' courts were
constantly appealed to by churchwardens to deal with cases where a man
and a woman, after publication of banns, lived together as man and
wife, without marriage in church.  An excellent example is found in
the Archdeacon of Colchester's Court, held at Henham, Essex, 27
Nov. 1620, when action was taken against Nicholas Searle and Elizabeth
Dye, of Saffron Walden, for `livinge together, the banes of matrimonye
beinge asked longe since, and not married'.  The legislation of the
Commonwealth made this, for the time, legal and normal.  See, e.g.,
<HI1 REND="i">Essex Arch. Soc. Transactions</HI1>, vol. xiii. pt. 3
(Jan. 1914).</P><P>11. Unction might be recognized by St. James v. 14, but this use of
oil was a frequent subject of popular gibes.  It is so found as late
as Sir Walter Scott's <HI1 REND="i">Waverley</HI1>, chap. lxii.</P><P>12. The deadly hatred which later controversy directed against the
Pope and Romanist clergy (see verses and woodcuts in <HI1 REND="i">Ballad Society's</HI1> issues), as a dreaded foreign and
hostile power, was felt by Lollards against the whole Church, Anglican
as well as Roman.</P><P>13. This carefully-taught equivocation, by which Lollards were
trained to meet the searching inquiries of Ecclesiastical Courts, is a
remarkable addition to the history of casuistry.  It rests on a
Lollard exposition of 1 Cor. iii. 16 ('Know ye not that ye are the
temple of God').</P><P>14. Is it possible that there was in 1457, in mid-England, a
militant Lollard party, secretly mustering forces with a view to an
armed rising?  It is conceivable that traditions of the Peasants'
Revolt of 1381 had been handed on from father to son and grandson.  In
the south, Henry V's ruthless proceedings against Sir John Oldcastle
(1414-17) may have crushed the spirits and strength of the Lollards,
only to leave smouldering fires of discontent further north.</P></DIV4></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:1.11.2" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.39"><HEAD>[II. Text of the Recantation.]<LB/>

Courts.]</HEAD><P>The severity, and unnecessarily humiliating features, of the
punishments imposed in the Ecclesiastical Courts continued right on
into Elizabeth's reign, or even later.  From the official minute-books
of the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, I give some hitherto
unpublished notices of these 'penances', which both illustrate the
system and show how each individual penance differed at the discretion
of the presiding judge.  The conjunction of open penance in both
market and church continued a long time, but was gradually replaced by
open penance in church only.</P><P>15 December, 1569, a young woman of High Ongar, Essex, was
sentenced by the Archdeacon of Essex
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>to appeare at Chelmsford to do open penaunce in the markett, in a
sheet, and ther to confesse her offense penitently, and on Sunday
after to do the lyke in Ongar church.</P></Q1></P><EPB/><PB N="106" ID="pb.70"/><P>16 December, 1590, a young woman of Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, was
ordered —
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>vpon Satterdaye nexte to come into Malden towne, where she shal be
placed openly vpon some scaffolde, abowte xi. of the clocke in the
forenoone of the same daye, and shall there stand vntill one of the
clock in the afternoone of the same daye, in a white sheete, and a
white wande in her hand;</P><P>and the next Sunday following she shall come into the church of
Bradwell, at the beginninge of the first lesson for morning praier,
attired in a whyt sheet, and shall there in penitent manner continewe
vntyll the service and sermon be ended.</P></Q1></P><P>On 17 June, 1591, a parishioner of Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex,
received this sentence in the Archdeacon of Essex's Court:
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>He shall vpon the next Saboth, or vpon Sundaye come sevenighte, at
the beginninge of morninge praier, come into the church of Burnham,
apparrelled in a white sheete, and white wande in his hande, and there
shal be placed in some conveniente place, neare the minister and in
sighte of the congregation there assembled, and so stande vntill such
tyme as the minister in the tyme of sermon (or of readinge of an
homilie) shall call for him, and then [he] shall confesse and
acknowledge that, whereas he hath byn called before the judge of this
corte for suspicion of evil life, and by denieing therof hath had the
benefytt of law to purge him selfe (if he so cold), wherein he hath
fayld, and is therefore founde by lawe and pronounced for guiltye of
the fact, he doth therefore acknowledg that he hath grevously offended
the maiestie of God in his wicked life and adulterous lyvinge; for
which his most wicked and adulterous life, he shall aske mercy at the
hands of almighty God and desire him in his mercy to pardon him his
former ill life, and desire the congregation presente also to forgyve
him, and to pray with him that he may be forgyven his wickednes at
God's hands; and promise amendment of his former wickednes; and shall
then say some praier after the minister, at the minister's discretion.</P></Q1></P><P>12 December, 1592, in the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held in
Ingatestone Church, a parishioner of Downham, Essex, had this
sentence:
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>On Sundaie next he shall come to Downham Churche at the last peale
to servyce, and there stand in a white sheete at the church porche
till the second lesson be redd, and then shall goe into the Church,
and there stand and penitently confesse his fault and offence.</P></Q1></P><P>It was certified in a Court, held 19 January, 1592-3, that this
penance had been performed.</P><P>This humiliating form of public penance became still more degraded
when people of substance could purchase exemption<EPB/><PB N="107" ID="pb.71"/>
from it.  It is one of the many indications of the great poverty of
Elizabeth's reign that Ecclesiastical Judges are found readily
assenting to 'commutation' of penance.  Even where the Archdeacon did
not feel authorized to allow such commutation, an appeal to the Bishop
was generally successful in obtaining it.  The following examples are
all authentic, being taken from the official minute-books of the Court
of the Archdeacon of Essex, and are, I think, fairly representative of
this unpleasant feature of English social life.  Wealthy people could
buy commutation; poor people continued to be exposed to open shame.</P><P>13 December, 1569, the Archdeacon of Essex sentenced a parishioner
of Leyton, Essex, to penance: <Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>viz. that he should stande in Romford
markett, the next markett daye, <FOREIGN LANG="lat">more
penitentis</FOREIGN>, all the markett tyme, in a whyte sheate, and a
rod in his hande, and in his parish church of Leyton, in the same way,
on the Sunday following, and ther shall acknowledg his offens
penitently.</P></Q1></P><P>But, on appeal of the man so sentenced, backed by entreaty of some
of his neighbours, he was excused penance, on condition of giving
10s. each to three poor scholars of Cambridge, and 10s. towards the
repair-fund of Leyton church.</P><P>29 February, 1591-2, a parishioner of Romford, who had been
ordered public penance in Romford Chapel, on a Sunday, in the time of
Morning Prayer, brought a petition in his favour signed by some
parishioners, and was allowed to substitute semi-private penance
before the minister and some parishioners selected by the minister, on
condition of putting 20s. into the hands of the minister to be
distributed by him among the poor of Romford liberty.</P><P>31 March, 1596, William Tabor, Archdeacon of Essex, who had
ordered public penance to two persons, received a letter, dated 4
March, 1595-6, in which Richard Fletcher, bishop of London, in
consideration of money paid to him 'to be imployed in godly uses',
discharged both parties from obligation to do penance, and ordered all
proceedings against them in the Ecclesiastical Courts to cease.</P></DIV4></DIV3></DIV2><EPB/><PB N="108" ID="pb.72"/><DIV2 NODE="LinDDoc:1.12" TYPE="bishop court" ID="DIV2.50"><HEAD TYPE="main">XII: Proceedings, taken 1457, against Thomas Hull of

art') to invoke evil spirits, and compel them to discover buried
treasure, and render like services, continued so late that the
practice became not only a favourite theme of the raconteur and
novelist (see John Aubrey's <HI1 REND="i">Brief Lives</HI1>, under Thomas
Allen, i. 27, and John Dee, i. 213, and Sir Walter Scott's <HI1 REND="i">Waverley</HI1>, ch. xiii), but an anathema of the Statute-books
(both English, viz. 1563, 5 Eliz. cap. 16; and Scottish, see Sir
Walter Scott's <HI1 REND="i">Waverley</HI1>, chap. lxvii).</P><P>Charges of witchcraft, as being against the Canon Law, were
constantly brought before the Ecclesiastical Courts.  I give here a
number of later authentic instances of such charges, taken from the
official minute-books of the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex.  They
serve to illustrate this old Hertfordshire case, as mentioned in this
set of papers; and also to indicate the wide range of this popular
belief.</P><P>12 July, 1591, in the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held in
West Ham Church, two widows of Woodford, Essex, were cited to answer
charges of witchcraft.  In both cases, since the charge is preferred
by one person, it was probably brought in by a man who believed
himself to have been bewitched.
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>Widow May, of Woodford, accused: she hath of long tyme byne
suspected for a wiche, and nowe of late suspected by William
Foxe.</P><P>Widow Coppres, of Woodford, accused: she hath of long time

that he could by his skill detect a thief:
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>3 February, 1591-2, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held
in Romford Chapel, John Munday, of Loughton, Essex, appeared, on a
charge made by the Churchwardens there, that he 'went to a connyng man
to learne of goods that were stolen or gon.'  The case was
dismissed.</P><P>16 June, 1595, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex,
held in Romford Chapel, the churchwardens of Barking, in Essex,
complained that — Carter, of that parish, is generally reported
to be a cunning man, 'and dothe take monye of diuerse to helpe theim
to things lost and stolen, viz. of one for 2 clokes stolen, &lt;of
another&gt; for a ring lost.'</P></Q1></P><EPB/><PB N="109" ID="pb.73"/><P>Another common reason of resort to conjurers, was to obtain their
help to force spirits to reveal the position of buried treasure.
There was an entertaining instance of this at Beeleigh Abbey, near
Maldon, Essex, in 1591: see <HI1 REND="i">Essex Review</HI1>, xvi. 68.</P><P>Frequently the supposed wizard, or cunning man, was consulted about
illness, human or of cattle.
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>2 May, 1592, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held in
Romford Chapel, John Grave, junior, of Romford, was delated by the
churchwardens there that he 'doth goe and seeke after witchery.'
Accused said that his wife, without his consent, 'did goe to father
Perfoche, to learne of him some medycyne for some cattell that he had
sick, but he knoweth not that father Perfoche is a witche; and his
wife (as he verely beleveth) did neuer thinke him to be a witche, and
went not to him desirouse to obtaine any helpe for his cattell by any
suche meanes.'</P><P>Grave was solemnly admonished against having
recourse to sorcery; and was dismissed the Court on payment of 2s.
Court-fees.</P><P>In the same Court, on the same day, on the same
charge, proceedings were instituted against William Moushowe, of
Romford, with the same result.</P></Q1></P><P>To repel a charge of this sort, the accused person, if allowed by
the Court, might produce written testimony of good character.
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>2 May, 1592, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held in
Romford Chapel, Alice, wife of William Foster of Barkinge, suspected
by common fame to be a witche, brought a certificate of her innocency
under the hands of the Churchwardens there.  The case was dismissed,
but the accused had to pay the Court-fee (12d.) and the apparitor's
fee (4d.), as well as the expenses of the journey to Romford.</P></Q1>
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>3 May, 1592, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held in
Ingatestone Church, it was reported that one Whaple of Fobbing did
make complaint against Joan Bell, of Fobbing, of suspicion of
wytchcraft.  She appeared in Court, and 'vtterly denieth' the
suspicion to be true.  She was ordered to bring to a later Court a
certificate from 'fower of her honest neighbors' that she is reputed
to be an honest woman and not at all thought to be a witch.  </P><P>On
2 June, 1592, she brought into Court a certificate from honest women
of Fobbing that she lay under no suspicion of witchcraft.</P></Q1></P><P>In other cases the Court refused to allow an accused person to
clear himself, except by the cumbrous and expensive process of
compurgation.  A deed was drawn out, to be publicly read, on a Sunday,
in the church of the parish where the offence was alleged to have been
committed, announcing that at a Court to<EPB/><PB N="110" ID="pb.74"/>
be held at a given place and on a given day, the accused person
proposed to purge himself of the charge by taking oath of innocence,
and inviting all who objected to such purgation to attend the Court
and give evidence against the accused.  The accused then attended the
appointed Court, bringing with him his compurgators (in number four,
six, eight, or other number, as had been fixed by the Court), and
exhibiting his parish-priest's certificate that the 'Intimacion' had
been duly read.  Objectors were then invited to appear, and, if any
attended, were heard, and the case adjourned.  If no objection was
made, the accused person took oath openly that he was innocent of the
charge, and each of the compurgators took oath that he believed that
the accused person had sworn the truth.  Compurgators for men had to
be men of good repute, of the same (or neighbouring) parish as the
accused; for women, honest women, of the same (or neighbouring)
parish; for clerics, beneficed clergy of neighbouring parishes.  On
the strength of these oaths, the accused was acquitted, and granted a
certificate to prevent any future proceedings on the same charge.  The
fees were considerable: 2s. 6d. for the Intimacio; 4d. for each oath
taken; 13s. 4d. for the certificate; and, in addition, the usual fees
to the Court and to the Apparitors.  Besides, the accused no doubt had
to defray the day's expenses of those who appeared as compurgators.
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>5 May, 1592.  In a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, held in All
Saints Church, Maldon, Margaret Wiseman (wife of John Wiseman of
Maulden) was delated by the Churchwardens, for that she is suspected
by common fame of wytchcrafte.  She claimed and was allowed purgation.
5 July, 1592, she appeared in Court with her Compurgatrices (Judith
wife of John Cowrtnol, Margaret wife of Thomas Carter, Agnes wife of
George Warner, Agnes wife of Robert Brierly, Agnes wife of Richard
Flude, and Elizabeth wife of John Pratt — all of Maldon).  Margaret
Wiseman then took oath that she is 'altogether guyltless of the facte
of witchcrafte and also of all occation of suspicion of witchcrafte'.
Her six compurgatrices then took oath that Margaret Wiseman hath sworn
a just and true oath, and that she 'hath not geven any cause of
suspicion of witchcrafte'.  Her purgation was then admitted, and the
testimonial of its acceptance was signed; but the Judge of the Court
solemnly admonished her to be most careful in future to give no cause,
in any way, for like suspicion.</P></Q1></P><EPB/><PB N="111" ID="pb.75"/><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:1.12.1" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.51"><MILESTONE N="14 or 14 bk." UNIT="leaf"/><HEAD>[I. Confession of, and Abjuration of, Acts of

formal expulsion from the list of Notaries public entitled to practise
in the Consistory Court of Lincoln Diocese.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.22"><P>From bishop John Chedworth's Register at Lincoln, lf. 47.  The
story is not very clearly told in the Register, but this seems to be
the substance of it.  Two chief offences had been brought home to the
culprit.  First, he had accepted bribes to foist Robert Cade, priest,
into the perpetual curacy of Aylesby (near Grimsby, Lincolnshire).
The Bishop of Lincoln presented to the rectory of Aylesby 24 March,
1445-6 (Alnwick's Register, fol. 97), but the church was soon
afterwards appropriated to Lincoln Minster.  The date of the
proceedings is uncertain, since the documents in the Register are out
of order, the one before Pyckard's case is 1458, but the one before
that is 1557.  The one after Pyckard's case is 1564.  So far as I can
make out, bishop John Chedworth had claimed the right of presentation
to the curacy on this occasion for himself, on some technical ground.
The bishop had then caused his mandate for the institution of his
nominee to be made out, and committed it to this notary (Richard
Pyckard) for transmission to 'Master' Alexander, who was possibly
acting as deputy of the Archdeacon of Lincoln.  Richard Pyckard,
thereupon broke open the sealed envelope ('pyxis'), removed the

Lincolnshire, with proceedings thereon.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.25">From bishop John Chedworth's Register at Lincoln, lf. 91.  The
date is apparently the last days of December, 1468.  The greater part
of the narrative is in Latin, of which only a summary is here given.
For this summary I am responsible.</NOTE1><P>Ordinary cases of breach of peace and assault were dealt with, in
most parishes, by the leet-courts of the several manors, and, in most
municipalities, by the borough magistrates.  But, if the altercation
took place in a church or a churchyard, the case passed out of the
jurisdiction of any civil court, and came before the Ecclesiastical
Court, generally that of the Archdeacon.  Too frequently these cases
were trivial matters that could have been smoothed over without legal
procedure, except for the apparitor's keen search for fees.  To
illustrate this Grantham case, from later years, I give a few
(hitherto unpublished) notices of such cases, from the official
minute-books of the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex.
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>15 July, 1591, in a Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held in
Prittlewell church, Thomas Peerse, of All Saints, Maldon, was
indicted, at the instance of the Churchwardens there, because he
'brake the pease and made a blood-shedd vpon Ralph tiler in the church
of All Sainctes in the time of the sermon'.</P><P>Peerse brought a certificate from Robert Palmer, vicar of All Saints,
Maldon, that 'there was a lewde and vngratious boye that, in the tyme of
the sermon, did disturbe the people; and Thomas Peerse, sytting neare him,
did gyve him a stroke vpon the cheeke, after which the boye was quiett'.</P><P>Thomas Peerse offered 'to make faithe that he did not strike the
boye anie other wise, nor in other manner, nor vpon anie other
intente'.</P><EPB/><PB N="126" ID="pb.90"/><P>Peerse was sentenced to pay 8d. to the poor, and excommunicated
until further order.</P></Q1>
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>15 January, 1591-2, in the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex held
at Romford, Richard Fynson of Loughton appeared to answer a charge of
striking John Monday in Loughton churchyard on Sept. 26, 1591.  He
admitted that `in gest and sport and not upon any collor or anger, he
did tripp vpp his heeles, as he was sytting vpon the Church rayles'.
He was ordered to confess publicly, before the minister and the
congregation, `that he hath vnorderly behaued himselfe', and to pay
12d. to the poor of the parish.</P></Q1>
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>3 June, 1592, in his Court held at Great Baddow, the Archdeacon of
Essex had before him five parishioners of South Hanningfield, Essex,
on a charge of scolding and brawling in the churchyard there.  Henry
Sowche admitted that he had used some words of strife (being moved
thereto), but now they are agreed and all things are quiet, and no
contention restethe amongst his neighbors.  For his offence, he was
ordered to make public apology in South Hanningfield Church.  William

<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>12 May, 1595, in the Court of the Archdeacon of Colchester, held in
Saffron Walden church, Essex, John Waylett of Ugley, Essex, was
proceeded against because he said to Robert Meade, church-clerk, in
service-tyme in the churchyard that `he was a pickthanck Knave to say
that his boy (John Waylett) dyd wrastle in the churchyard in the tyme
of divine service at morning prayer'.  Waylett admitted calling Meade
`knave' in the churchyard, but pleaded that Meade `urged hym therto,

Grantham, between Thomas Wortley, Corvyser, and Edward Singer, a
minister of that church.  It was presumed that the churchyard had
thereby been polluted, and the matter was referred to the Vicar
(Richard Dawe) and John Tyssington, acting as Commissaries for the
bishop.  This Commission took the sworn evidence of Thomas Wortley
himself, of Sir Thomas Wynneway and Sir William lempster (priests),
and of William lempster and William Welbourne (ministers of the
church).  They found that Wortley had struck Singer violently with a
stick, who shed blood from his nose in no small quantity, in the
churchyard.  The Commissaries further declared that the churchyard had
thereby been polluted, and excommunicated Wortley.  On January 31, 146
8-9, Wortley confessed his deed<EPB/><PB N="127" ID="pb.91"/>
before John Chedworth, the bishop, in the house of Henry Curteys of
Grantham; and took oath on the gospels to do penance as would be
ordered him.  The Bishop appointed Master John Goule, bachelor in the
decrees, to absolve Wortley from the excommunication which he had
incurred.  The penance was that Wortley should go with bare shins
(<FOREIGN LANG="lat">tibiis</FOREIGN>) and feet at the time of the
reconciliation of the churchyard by the bishop, and, humbly and in
penitent wise, minister holy water, at the bishop's nod, to the bishop
in the 'reconciliation' ceremony.  On Purification (2 February),
i.e. on the second day after this verdict, Wortley was also, clad only
in shirt and breeches, and carrying in one hand a wax taper and in the
other a pair of beads, to walk humbly at the head of the procession
which was to take place on that Feast, to kneel down at the four
corners of the churchyard or of the church (according as the weather
allowed the procession to be in the open air or not), and to be
disciplined by the rod by the curate who was in charge of the
procession.  After the procession was over, at the time of High Mass,
Wortley was to be waiting in the baptistery, engaged in private
prayer, and, when the offertory of the Mass was made, was to place his
taper in the hands of the celebrant.  Like penance was to be made on
Sundays, February 7 and 14, at the time of the procession on those
days.  Further, on Saturdays, February 6, 13, 20, and 27, at the hour
when the market was fullest of people, Wortley, attired as a penitent,
and with wax taper and beads, accompanied by the curate (in surplice
and stole, and carrying a rod), was to walk round Grantham
market-place, and at each of the four corners to submit himself to
correction.  On each of the four Saturdays, after the penance was
done, the curate was to make public declaration, in English, of the
cause why it had been imposed.  The formula to be used by the curate
is as follows:</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:1.19.2" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.79"><HEAD>[II. Full English Text of the Recital made by the

Bruern, in the county and archdeaconry of Oxford, to King Edward IV,
to have again the impropriated rectory of Wootton, near Woodstock,
formerly granted them by King Henry VI, but afterwards resumed by the
Crown.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.27"><P>From bishop John Chedworth's Register at Lincoln, lf. 240.  The
long reign of Henry VI (1 September, 1422, to 4 March, 1460-1) had
been very fruitful both in benefactions to older secular colleges and
religious houses, and in new foundations for educational or religious
purposes.  The recognition by Parliament of Edward IV on 4 March, 146
0-1, followed by the Yorkist triumph at Towton, 29 March, 1461,
threatened the very existence of all recent foundations, and the
impoverishment of many older foundations, e.g. Eton College, and
several colleges in<EPB/><PB N="129" ID="pb.93"/>
Oxford and Cambridge, as well an monasteries.  The Crown lawyers of
the new sovereign seemed to be resolved to show in the law-courts the
like mercy to grants made by Henry VI (now designated 'king of England
de facto but not de iure') as his troops had shown in the field in
their savage slaughter of the vanquished Lancastrians.  The present
petition is a representative of many hundreds of the sort which were
sent up to Edward IV in these first years of deadly fear.  It is not
for a moment to be supposed that these details came within the King's
personal supervision or added anything to the revenues of the Crown:
they were processes which brought considerable fees to the
law-officers of the Crown, and abundant payments to their underlings
for transcription, sealing, and registration.</P><P>On 2 Aug. 1140,
Henry VI, by grant under Privy Seal, gave to Bruerne Abbey the
patronage of Wootton Church, with licence to impropriate it, but
reserving £8 yearly to the Exchequer.  The Pope and the Bishop
of Lincoln would not allow the impropriation, and, on 18 June, 1445,
Henry VI forgave the arrears of the £8 charge, and cancelled
future payments, until the impropriation had taken effect.</P><P>The
petition is prefixed to an Institution to Wootton, 18 Aug., 1464, on
presentation by Edward IV.</P></NOTE1><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:1.20.1" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.82"><MILESTONE N="240" UNIT="leaf"/><HEAD>[I.

Syresham, Northamptonshire, and Biddlesden Abbey in Buckinghamshire as
to tithes of certain lands in Syresham parish.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.47"><P>From bishop John Longland's Register of Memoranda at Lincoln,
lf. 264, lf. 264 bk., and lf. 265.</P><P>The explanation of the enrolment of this agreement is most aptly
given in a charter, dated Monday before All Saints' day (29 October),
1274, found among Westminster Chapter Muniments, and brought to my
notice by Dr. W. Warde Fowler.</P><P>The Priory of Hurley, Berkshire, agreed to allow, in consideration
of the payment of 10s. half-yearly, the Rectory of Kingham,
Oxfordshire, quiet possession of certain tithes which the Priory used
to collect in that parish.  But the Priory made this agreement
conditional on the rector's obtaining, at his own costs, both from the
Bishop, and from the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln, a full ratification
of the agreement so as to ensure its due observance in future.
Clearly, in this Syresham case, Biddlesden Abbey must have followed
the same course.</P><P>A second stipulation made by Hurley Priory was even more drastic,
and is most suggestive of the multitudinous trouble incident to
collection of tithe.  This stipulation was that (by the authority of
the Bishop and Chapter) the rector of Kingham and his successors
should bind themselves to allow the Archdeacon of Oxford (or his
Official), if they had omitted to pay this ten shillings in any year,
to compel them, by excommunication in the Archdeacon's Ecclesiastical
Court, on mere production of this agreement, to pay this
tithe-rent-charge, with any arrears that had arisen, and all expenses
incurred in connexion with the case; and should expressly renounce all
right of appeal to any other law-court.</P></NOTE1><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:1.40.1" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.155"><MILESTONE N="264" UNIT="leaf"/><HEAD>[I.] <FOREIGN LANG="lat">Compositio inter Abbatem et

Longland, bishop of Lincoln, to the Archdeacons of his diocese, in
connexion with Henry VIII's orders as to Preachers and as to
Bidding-Prayers.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.56"><P>From bishop John Longland's Register of Memoranda at Lincoln,
lf. 266 bk.  By a singular oversight the dates of both letters are
omitted.  No copy of the Orders referred to is contained in the
Register, but their import may be gathered from the letters
themselves, as well as from the summary given in Froude's <HI1 REND="i">History</HI1>.</P></NOTE1><P>The first letter contains an odd bit of indirect evidence as to
the slowness with which even those in authority recognized the
usefulness of the printer's art.  Although it was clearly of
importance that every cleric should know exactly the terms of the
Orders he was called upon to observe, no printed copy of these Orders
was distributed, but individual clerics were invited to write out each
a copy for himself.  In 1536-7 (No. LV) printed copies of the King's
Orders were provided for distribution.</P><P>The Orders issued as to preachers were intended to prevent pulpit
handling of the controversy as to the supremacy of the King or of the
Pope over the Church of England.  To that end, preachers were
forbidden to handle controversial topics in their sermons, and to
confine themselves to exhortations to fear God and honour the King.
This was the precedent followed by Laud and Charles I, 1630 and
onwards, in respect of the fierce controversy then waged as to
predestination, when they forbade preachers to discuss the burning
question of the hour.  In both instances, authority was defied.
Preachers and congregations were too keenly interested in the
forbidden topic to leave off discussing it.</P><P>Further, no cleric was to presume to preach unless he had had a
licence to preach granted him by his Bishop or Archdeacon.  Care
would, of course, be taken to refuse a licence to any cleric who was
notoriously opposed to the King's claims.</P><P>Because of the general contempt shown to these Orders, in his
second letter, a year later in date, the bishop ordered the provision,
and due keeping, of a register of preachers in every church, with a
note of the subject touched on in each sermon.  Following up this
idea, the Archdeacons, till quite recent years, at their every
Visitation, were very urgent with the<EPB/><PB N="195" ID="pb.159"/>
Church-wardens of each parish to provide 'a Book of Strange Preachers'
and see that entries were duly made in it.</P><P>Each sermon was at this time preceded by the Bidding-prayer, so
called because in it the preacher asked the congregation to pray for
the persons, or the souls of persons departed, whom he specially
commended to them.  The terms of this prayer were left very much to
the preacher himself, as he might feel himself directed by the
statutes of the College to which he belonged or of the Chantry which
he served.  No doubt, preachers, up till now, had been in the habit of
beginning their bidding-prayer with the words, 'Ye shall pray for the
holy father, the pope'; and this was now forbidden.  The
bidding-prayer is still in use in Oxford before University Sermons in
St. Mary's Church and City Sermons in the church of All Saints and
St. Martin's, but in both cases the prayer now follows a printed form.</P><P>In the Register, on lf. 267, immediately after the two letters, two
inhibitions are enrolled, one addressed to John Vyall, Warden of the
Friars Minors of Bedford, the other to Edmund Philipes, rector of
Maulden, Bedfordshire, cancelling their licences to preach and
forbidding them to preach; dated, Old Temple, London, 11 March, 1535

Festival Days.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.63">From bishop John Longland's Register of Memoranda at Lincoln,
lf. 275 bk. and lf. 276.</NOTE1><P>The trouble about Holy-days was not that there were several of
them in each month in Church Calendar, and that the bells rang for
service on these days, morning and evening; but that attendance at
such Holy-day services was compulsory on all parishioners, and
non-attendance was punishable at the discretion of the Ecclesiastical
Courts.  Consequently, work on these days, however urgent in the
interest of the farm, was contrary to Canon Law, and punishable.</P><P>To show the working of the system, I give some examples,<EPB/><PB N="213" ID="pb.177"/>
from authentic and unpublished records of Elizabeth's reign, preserved
in the official minute-books of the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex.
It is to be remembered that, in all such cases of prosecution for
working on Holy-days, the odium and the severity of the proceedings
went far beyond the actual fine imposed, or the actual apology
ordered.  There were —</P><P>(a) the Court fees: at least 4d. to the apparitor for serving the
citation, and at least 12d. to the Court for hearing the case; and,
often, like fees for recording the performance of the order made by
the Court, so as to have a formal conclusion of the case;</P><P>(b) the day taken up to attend the Court, which, generally, was
held at some centre a long way from the accused man's abode; and the
expenses incurred in the journey;</P><P>(c) the disgrace of being herded, on a mere charge of doing work or
taking part in athletics, with a crowd of parish offenders, brought
into court because of gross offences against decency and morality.</P><P>7 November, 1586, a young man of Romford was brought into the
Court of the Archdeacon of Essex on the charge of 'plaieinge at
stoole-bawle on holie Thursdaie last in service tyme, and gave crewell
wordes to the churchwardens for demaundinge 12d. of him for his
absence from church'.  He admitted that he had been at stool-ball that
afternoon, but asserted that he had been at Evening Prayer.  He was
sentenced to pay 12d. to the poor; and (of course) had to pay court
and apparitor's fees.</P><P>5 May, 1592, Richard Jeffercy, of Asheldham, Essex, was brought
before the Court of the Archdeacon of Essex, on the charge that he
'had procured company together, and plaied at foote-ball' in Hackwell,
Essex, on Easter Monday, in Evening Service time.  He pleaded that he
'did not knowe that there was at Hackwell any eveninge prayer' on that
day.  He was ordered to pay 4d. to the poor of Asheldham.</P><P>8 May, 1591, Richard Jeppe, of Chignall Mary and James, Essex, was
charged before the Archdeacon of Essex, with having carted and carried
hay on our Lady Day last.  He admitted<EPB/><PB N="214" ID="pb.178"/>
that, on the day, 'a boye of his did fetch home a lyttle haye with his
carte and horse.'  He was ordered:
<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>On Sunday nexte, immediately after the seconde lesson is red at
eveninge praier, to come into the bodye of the churche, and, before
the minister, to acknowledge his falte, and shew himselfe sorie for
that his seruante did breake the queen's law, and promise that there
shall not be the like falte committed againe.</P></Q1></P><P>On June 15, 1591, this Richard Jeppe paid 4d. to an apparitor of
the court, to have his certificate of having duly made apology (as
ordered) put on record.</P><P>14 September, 1591, Thomas Sorrell, of Woodham Ferrers, Essex,
attended the Court held in Ingatestone Church, to answer the charge
that he 'went to ploughe vpon Bartholomew daye last in the forenoone'.
He was ordered to pay 2s. to the use of the poor.</P><P>Before Henry VIII's decree, the burden of Holy-days was especially
grievous, because several of these fell within the busy weeks of
harvest, when, in view of the scarcity of food (each harvest being
barely sufficient for the needs of the country), and of the
uncertainty of the weather, every effort ought to have been made on
favourable days to get the grain safely into barn.  So far as Henry
VIII's Order in Council dealt with this national trouble, it is most
laudable.  It is even to be regretted that a like measure of relief
was not extended to the equally important, and equally
weather-troubled, season of haymaking, if not also to ploughing and
sowing in years when the weather hampered these works.</P><P>If such reasonable relief had been given in these respects, there
would have been no need for the abolition of certain distinctive local
Festival-days, as by this Order in Council was ruthlessly enjoined.</P><P>Every parish had its own two local Holy-days; (i) the day of the
patron-saint to which the church was dedicated; (ii) the day of the
dedication of the church.</P><P>This second festival probably perpetuated, by unwritten but<EPB/><PB N="215" ID="pb.179"/>
continuous tradition, the actual day of the dedication of the
building, as originally consecrated.  As a result of Henry VIII's
Order the dedication-day of most churches is now irrecoverable.</P><P>Two examples of the two parish festival-days may be given:</P><P>At All Saints, Oxford, the patronal-day was, of course, November 1,
All Saints day; but it is on record that the dedication-day of the
church was November 18.  At St. Michael's North Gate, Oxford, the
patronal-day was September 29 (St. Michael and All Angels), but the
dedication-day of the church was October 16, a later St. Michael
festival (St. Michael in <FOREIGN LANG="lat">monte tumba</FOREIGN>).</P><P>The Order in Council appointed (infra, p. 218) four days, one at
the end of each quarter, to be 'the foure generall offeryng dayes'.  I
hazard the opinion that this was done to reduce to uniformity the
practice of different churches in keeping their yearly masses in
commemoration of their founders and benefactors.</P><P>My information about these comes from the <HI1 REND="i">Bursars'
Accounts</HI1> in the Archives of Lincoln College, Oxford.</P><P>At All Saints Church, Oxford, this mass was said once a year,
generally about the end of January, but apparently on a day chosen at
random each year.  The churchwardens, I assume, paid the charges out
of the moneys they had in hand.<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>1506 [beginning of February], recept. in obitu pro

in Bishop Longland's Register, is at first sight puzzling; but is
readily explained by his having put down 'duke of Clarence' for the
'duchy of Clarence office'.  The facts are sufficiently stated in
James Wright's <HI1 REND="i">History and Antiquities of
… Rutland</HI1> (1684), pp. 130, 131.  Uppingham manor belonged to
Anne Beauchamp, sister and heiress (1449) of Henry, 15th earl and 1st
duke of Warwick, and wife of Richard Nevil, 17th earl of Warwick.
After her husband's death on Barnet field, 1471, Uppingham (with other
of her estates) was settled on her elder daughter Isabel, wife of
George, Duke of Clarence (brother of Edward IV).  After the attainder
of 'false perjured Clarence' in January 1477-8, his estates were
forfeited to the<EPB/><PB N="220" ID="pb.184"/>
Crown, and were retained by the Crown till Elizabeth's reign.  The
Crown managed them by a Steward.  In 1484 the Stewardship of the
lordship of Uppingham, and of other lordships and lands which formerly
had belonged to George, Duke of Clarence, was granted to Simon Digby
(afterwards Sir Simon, of Coles Hill, co. Leicester), who died 27
February, 15 19-20.  In 1546 the manor of Uppingham was temporarily
granted by Edward VI to his sister Elizabeth (afterwards Queen), the
rents being then collected by Richard Darrington, the King's Receiver
in Rutland.</P><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:1.56.1" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.208"><MILESTONE N="279 bk." UNIT="leaf"/><HEAD>Lettre of the duke of Clarence for the comyn of the

furnishing exact transcripts of five interesting documents, which are
also of great value to this volume because they supplement the
information contained in the documents formerly transcribed for the
Society.  Inasmuch as all five fall within the limits of
Dr. F. J. Furnivall's period, and are of equal importance with those
noted by him for transcription, I conclude that their omission by him
was an oversight.  It is, therefore, with great pleasure, that I am
enabled to give the text of them here.</P><P>Canon Foster also tells me that at the end of bishop John
Longland's Register of Memoranda there are copies of five indentures
of the same type as those included in this volume, viz.:
<LIST><ITEM>Lease for 40 years of a pasture in the parish of Leighton,
Huntingdonshire, belonging to the prebend of Leighton Bromeswold,
dated 7 August, 34 Henry VIII (1542): bishop John Longland's Register
of Memoranda, lf. 308 bk.</ITEM><ITEM>Lease for 40 years of the parsonage of Farendon and Balderton,
excepting the presentations to the vicarages of those two places,
dated 20 April, 34 Henry VIII (1543): bishop John Longland's Register
of Memoranda, lf. 307, 308, 308 bk.</ITEM><ITEM>Lease for 31 years of the rectory of Mumby in the parts of
Lyndesey, Lincolnshire, excepting the advowson of the vicarage there,
dated 10 January, 36 Henry VIII (1544-5): bishop John Longland's
Register of Memoranda, lf. 303 bk. and 304.</ITEM><ITEM>Lease for 21 years of that portion of the prebend of Dunham,
Lincolnshire, which is called 'the canon landes and tuythes', &amp;c.,
in the parish of Hogham, Lincolnshire, dated 20 January, 36 Henry VIII
(1544-5): bishop John Longland's Register of Memoranda, lf. 302
bk. and 303.</ITEM><ITEM>Lease for 35 years of the prebend of Langford Ecclesia,
Oxfordshire, excepting the advowson of the vicarage there, dated 12
May, 37 Henry VIII (1545): bishop John Longland's Register of

the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln from 1520 downwards, and probably some
of even earlier date.</P><P>From the space which these occupy in the Register, it is unlikely
that they were accidentally overlooked by Dr. Furnivall when he went
through that volume.  I conclude, therefore, that he intentionally
passed them over, either because their inclusion would have meant too
many documents of the later date, or because their subject-matter was,
in his judgement, adequately represented in the documents he had
already noted for transcription.  If either supposition is correct, I
have done right in excluding these from the present volume.</P><P>Bishop Longland's Register is divided into two portions: (i)
Institutions to benefices, which do not concern us here, and (ii)
Memoranda, records of proceedings of general interest, from which all
the documents here contained (for his episcopate) have been taken.
The Register has recently been re-folioed, and, by the thoughtful
kindness of Canon Foster, F.S.A., the new and permanent references
have been substituted for the haphazard folios found at the time when
the transcript was made.</P><DIV2 NODE="LinDDoc:2.1" TYPE="vow" ID="DIV2.233"><HEAD TYPE="main">Appendix I: Vow of celibacy, circ. 1452, by Agnes

1535.</HEAD><NOTE1 TYPE="ms" N="*" ID="note.76"><P>From bishop John Longland's Register of Memoranda,
at Lincoln, lf.  258 bk., 259, 259 bk.  The preceding document is
dated at Lincoln, 13 May, 1535; the document following is dated at
Wooburn 24 May, 1535.  Inasmuch as in this part of the Register the
documents follow each other very closely in order of date, the receipt
of the letter by the Bishop must be about the middle of May
1535.</P><P>The persecution of 'heretics' in France here mentioned,
the scattering about in the streets of Paris of pamphlets deriding the
doctrine of Transubstantiation, the great expiatory procession in
Paris, the king's fierce speech against 'heretics', and the public
burning of several 'heretics', are all set out in the larger histories
of France.  It is, however, something new to find a vivid description
of these incidents from the pen of an English eyewitness.  It is more
minute and exact, apparently, than the French record cited by
Sismondi.  A quaint touch is added by the haste of the letter-carrier
to be off which prevented the writer from fair-copying his letter.</P><P>The chief persons mentioned are — King Francois I, his
consort Eleanor of Austria, his eldest son (Francis the Dauphin, born
1517, and now eighteen years old, died 10 Aug. 1536), his second son
Henri (born 1519, and now sixteen years old, succeeded as Henri II in
1547), his third son Charles (d. 1545), the two princesses (Madeleine,
afterwards consort of James V of Scotland, and Margaret, afterwards
Duchess of Savoy), Jean de Guise, of Lorraine, born 1498, Cardinal
since 1518, Jean du Bellay, bishop of Paris.</P><P>It is recorded that
the Ambassadors of foreign powers, then present at the French Court,
were spectators of the procession.  Bishop John Longland's]
correspondent may well have been someone of importance in the English
ambassador's suite.  It is interesting that the letter should be in
English, and good English, and not in Latin.  Two or three odd things
are found in it, e.g. (i) the use of the French semblablement instead
of the<EPB/><PB N="249" ID="pb.213"/>
English semblably, suggestive of a person resident in France and
constantly speaking French; (ii) the phonetic spelling of le Chtelet,
suggestive of a foreigner, unfamiliar with the spelling of the names
of Parisian buildings.  The Swiss would be of interest to English
readers because Henry VIII had in 1521 asked the Cantons for leave to
enlist Swiss in his service.  The Ste. Geneviève procession is
described in a letter of la Marquise de
Sévigné.</P></NOTE1><DIV3 NODE="LinDDoc:2.4.1" TYPE="document" ID="DIV3.241"><HEAD>[Full Text of the Letter.]</HEAD><MILESTONE N="258 bk." UNIT="leaf"/><P>Such enewes as we haue here in Parrys I have sent you, As touchinge

at Lincoln, lf.  267.  Henry VIII's keen personal interest in the
great dogmatic controversy of the age, combined with his tyrannical
temper, spurred him on to extreme measures against all critics of the
doctrine of Transubstantiation.  All such were heretics, felons,
rebels, to be dealt with without mercy or remorse.  The statute
against heretics, here referred to, was passed in 1534 (25 Henr. VIII,
