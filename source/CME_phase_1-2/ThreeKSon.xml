And the Turkes might was daily dymynysshed and gretly damaged / wherfore him thought this deliueraunce was moost profitable to the kyng / for with his<EPB/><PB N="95"/>raunsone sholde he be of more power to damage his enemyes / The tothir knyght, hering what he had purposed, answerd to the contrary, shewyng that at that tyme the Turke, whiche was brother to kynge ffirabrace, helde seege before the place that the kynge had conquered vndir him / yn the whiche was enclosed the flour of knyghthode of that Reaume, and in especialle they to whom he is prisoner / whoos, of right, the prisoner is, and noon others / and if it so fortune that the Towne were taken by strength, whiche god, of his mercy diffende / if it were so / by the kynge of Perce, alle they that were withyn shold be rescowed, whiche is more worth than iiij. suche fynaunces as he is able to pay / "And for to answere to this that ye haue seide, that none suffiseth to the deliueraunce of the saide prisoner, but the only body of the kyng; by that meane that y say, ij. thousand noble men may be saue &amp; brought agein by hym.  And to come to reason / who ought so weel to be bought agein by hym, as they that toke hym, whos propre prisoner he is / forsoothe noon, as me thinketh.  Also remembre weel in what perells and in what fortunes ye haue seen the kyng here present, &amp; souverayn lord, be in this tyme, whiche, if he were prisoner, shold be in auenture euir to be had agein, if this kynge were deliuerd / Thies thinges considered, if y were as the kyng, for no thing shold he be delyuered / And whan it shalle please the kyng / vpone the debates of vs two, that be but of litle effecte to the reasons of my lordes that here be, he shalle here there aduise, and to do then as him thinkith moost to his wele" / The kynge of Sizile, heryng thise debates that were made, of good wille, and by noon hate, asked of him that spake last his aduise, whiche seide vnto him / that gladly he wolde say it / sith it pleased him so to commaunde him, whiche was this / that in no wise men ought not, nor might not entre in-to this matier without thauise and counselle of fferaunt, whiche <MILESTONE N="60" UNIT="leaf"/>was biseeged withyn the towne and hym, that now men lightly might speke with hym, for the kyng might write vnto the Turke, that without the aduise &amp; counselle of fferaunt &amp; Surnome, to whom his brother was prisoner, he wold not procede in that matier / and he thought be thise meanes the Turke shold be weel content that the kynges folkes might go speke with fferaunt.  And ij. reasons he shewed / that meued him to gif this counselle / that one is / that fferaunt is one of the wisist knightes of this Reaume, whiche apperetℏ weel by his werkes / And by this meane, if the kyng sende vnto him of his folkes, he shalle trewly be asserteyned<EPB/><PB N="96"/>of the demeanyng of fferaunt and of the Towne / and theraftir may he take counselle outher of the deliueraunce of his prisoner or of the contrary / And the tothir reason that he shewed, was this / that the seid prisoner had be taken twies by the handes of Surnome, in the presence of fferaunt his maister / without whom, by reason to holde trewly the right of armes, the seide prisoner might not be delyuered: "suche is the ordre of right and Iustice in dedes of armes / as y haue alway vndirstande / And as yet y can thinke of the saide prisoner, there hath be made no departyng bitwene them, nor noon accorde nor apoyntement / and therfore, shortly to conclude my matier / me thinkith, without their aduise it [were best] to procede no ferther."  Thus endid he / &amp; it thought vnto the kynge and his counselle that his aduise was right good &amp; Resonable / And then were letters writen and sent vnto the Turke, vndir suche fourme as thei were concluded by the counselle / as ye haue herde.  Thus were the messangers delyuered, and had grete giftes, and were surely condite, vnto the kynges power / and at their retourne agein vnto the Turke, they founde the hoste gretly troubed / for greuously had they ben assailed by them with-yn the Towne / and in especialle toward the Turkes loggyng / for there were made alway the grettist assawtes; and trouthe it was, that they had ben so hourely assailed sith the departing of the messangers, that they neuir might be at leiser to assemble in no counselle to-gidir / and diuers tymes wolde they haue short termes of trews &amp; comunicaccione with fferaunt / but he wold neuir answere hem to any suche matier, for he had no desire to dele nor trete with hem / wherof thei were fulƚ <MILESTONE N="60, bk." UNIT="leaf"/>soroufulƚ. So long contynued this maner of demeanyng, that the Turkes folkes were rigℏt wery / and endured grete payne &amp; labour / fferaunt, that was fulle wise, remembred weel this, &amp; thougℏt weel it were litle maistry to annoy them / and thought he had ben idle a gret while, and not mette with his enemyes / and so he saide to his folkes, with a merry contenaunce / "I se weel we be so presed on with oure enemyes to haue a tretee, whiche lettith not but yn vs, for we may haue alle that we can resonably aske / And it is longe sith oure neighboures &amp; frendes herde anything of vs, that knowe not weel where we are / therfore it is good that to-morowe we make vs to be knowen" / Alle they that were yn the place were ioyfulle of thise wordes, and in especialle Le Surnome and Athis / for in dedes of armes were thei neuir satisfied / and so answerd they vnto their maister, it shold be right wele done.  "so helpe me god," seide<EPB/><PB N="97"/>fferaunt, "I thinke to-morowe, with the helpe of god, to take suche acqueyntaunce amonges them, that they shalle not alle be pleased / for it is longe sith we made theim any grete assaute / and therfore go eueri man to his reste / and be vp to-morowe vpone the point of the day / and eueri man serue god / and we shall do aftir as weel as we may" / Thus eueri man went to reste him.  And that night made fferaunt al his smaƚƚ ordenaunce to be brought toward the Turkes loggyng / and on that side of the Towne made he to lay his grete Bombardes, ageinst the comyng of his enemyes / and there made he to be kepte moo fayrer &amp; sure watche.  In the mornyng / toward the poynt of day, were his folkes assembled about him / so ordeyned he a good company, as him thought sufficiaunt y nough to discomfite the wacche that was bifore / for to wynne the Turkes Bombardes, for they thought it was light y-nogh to do / and of the first company he made Capteynes, Le Surnome &amp; Athis / for wel knewe he that corageously they wolde do this entirprise / And the remenaunt of his folkes he guyded him self, for he thought the first company shold haue nede of releef: thus ordeyned he the assawte / And whan it was purueide, Le Surnome &amp; Athis ordeyned their folkes redy at the gate that was assigned vnto them / than made fferraunt the yate <MILESTONE N="61" UNIT="leaf"/>to be opende, and went out / and ascried the Turkes wacche, and they wende fulƚ weel to haue diffendid them / but their diffence litle auailed / for Surnomes company and Athis put as many to the swerde as they might gete, without takyng of any prisoners.  This first company passitℏ forth with so grete corage &amp; hardinesse that, er the Turke and his folkes might be armed, thei came to his logging, killyng and sleyng alle that euir mette with them / and ouirthrewe Tentes and Pavilions; and did so moche in armes that eueri man fled fro them / whan fferaunt sawe them passe so fer / he knewe it shold be grete auenture of their retourne / and therfore toke he his feliship, &amp; went aftir them / and passed by the place where the wacche had ben, and where moche of the Turkes ordenaunce lay, whiche he made labores, bothe men &amp; wommen, haue in to the Towne / whil he went to releef his first company.  and this assaute dured til the sonne risyng / and there was the noise and the crie so grete / that men might not haue herde the thondre / and the Turkes drewe them alle to the Turke, so grete a multitude that fferaunt saw wele his folkes might not long endure there / wherfore he made to blowe retrete; and by than had his first company taken so many prisoners, that they were<EPB/><PB N="98"/>almoost as many as them self / and ther were many of theim noble men / and of the Turkes counseƚƚ suche as had ben at the comunicacion of the trews / whan they withdrewe them / Surnome &amp; Athis were the last / and put their folkes &amp; their prisoners bifore them / and so moche endured they than, that it was meruaile; and had not fferaunt their good maister than releued them, they had neuir retourned agein in-to the Town / and it was meruaile to wite hou many Surnome &amp; Athis slowe at their retrayte / thus entred they in-to the Towne with alle their prisoners, to the grete damage and losse of the Turke, &amp; litle vnto theim.  In this grete brewte and trouble, came agein the heraldes, that had ben messangers from the Turke vnto the kyng of Sizile / and sawe the feeldes fulle of men of armes, &amp; had herde the noise and the crie more than ij. myle thens / This auenture turned to grete damage &amp; displeasir to the Turke &amp; his company / for thei sawe weel at length, by litle &amp; litle their power sholde empaire / for whan they witℏ-drewe theim they <MILESTONE N="61, bk." UNIT="leaf"/>knewe wele what Losse they had / for they founde of their folkes moo then xv C. dede, and moo then ij C. prisoners taken.  If the Turke had grete sorowe, it is no question, for the losse was turned vpon a grete party of the best of his hous / He coude not thinke that Le Surnome nor Athis were any mortalle men, but ij. thinges sente doune by the god of the cristen / for his destruction / for him semed, and alle othir, that there might not be so moche worthynesse yn the body of any erthely man, as he founde in theim that day / thus ranne the renomee of them thorugh alle the hoste / Thus whan the Turke was withdrawen, the heraldes, that y haue tolde you of bifore / entred in-to his Tente / and deliuerd him their lettres, whiche he redde / and then made alle theim to come vnto him, that were of his counselle / at that tyme beyng present / than made he to come afore him agein the messangers / and commaundid theim to telle suche credence as they had from the kynge of Sizile / and they made their report weel and wisely, as they that were of grete discrecion / whiche was suche as ye haue herde before, accordyng to thentent of the lettres / And to make shorte tale, the Turke agreed to the request of the kyng of Sizile right gladly / and hadde good cause / for eueri day he sawe his strenght empayre / So he made the Saufconditz to be made vp for suche names as the heraldes had brought / and in alle haste the Saufconditz, made and sealed, were sent agein vnto the kynge of Sizile.  Ye may weel<EPB/><PB N="99"/>thinke, that whan fferaunt and his company were entred agein in-to the Towne, they made grete ioy of the goode auenture that god had youen theim that day.  And whan he shold go to dyner, he made as many knyghtes and noble men sitt at his boorde as might haue Rome / and ij. boordes beside / amonges whiche company, Surnome and Athis were not forgoten, of whom he had more ioie than of any erthly men / and not without cause / for he had seen hem do in armes that day yncredibly / for they had taken with their awne handes vpone a iij.xx prisoners / and alwey deliuerd hem to othir for to kepe / while they contynued in bataile, without hauyng any regarde or remembraunce to couetise / as they that desired no thinge but to gete worship / and to do seruice to god in their cristen feith / for euerich thought in his owne mynde that they had y-nough in their owne contrees.  hou be it, their maners<MILESTONE N="62" UNIT="leaf"/> resembled no thinge kynges sones; they demeaned them liker pouere gentilmen / ffor albe-it there was noon so honorable as they two / yet for no fortune or auenture that couth befalle them / they wolde neuir take on̄ them to be knyghtes, excusyng them alway by the symplenesse of their birthe / and they hadde reason not to take on them the ordre of knyghthode / for they were knightes long before / hou be it, nouther of theim vndirstode of other / what birthe they were of / And fferaunt their maister, at his dyner, reported to them their outrageous hardinesse, in maner blamyng them of that they had done that day / for in abidyng them had he almoost lost grete part of his people / and if he coude haue thought that they wolde thus haue be rewled, he wold rather haue lefte them kepyng the Towne / than haue had them forth to the assaute.  thei answerde no thinge vnto their maister / but were al shamefast of his wordes, and thought that a nothir tyme they wolde not do so / but when they were in like caas agein / that purpose was alle lost and forgoten / Aftir dyner, fferaunt made to visite his prisoners / and founde that he had a party of the grettist &amp; moost prevy of the Turkes counselle, wherof he was rigℏt ioifulle, as reason was, and made them to be kepte, eueri man aftir his worship / and thus abideth he in his place, all ioyfulle &amp; assured of his enemyes / til that he herde tidinges of the kyng of Sizile / as ye shalle here / ye haue here before weel vndirstande hou the Turke sent vnto the kynge of Sizile saufcondite for iiij. of his knyghtes to come to fferaunt / This saufcondite was borne vnto the kyng by the same heraldes that late had ben with him fro the Turke, whicℏ Saufcondite<EPB/><PB N="100"/>the kynge resceyued, and made it to be redde / &amp; founde that it was good &amp; sure / Than purvaide he the iiij. knightes to go to fferaunt / and they toke leue of the kynge &amp; the quene, &amp; of their faire doughter, &amp; of alle the ladies &amp; gentilwomen / &amp; tolde them whider they wente / and eche of theim made their recommendacions / And faire Iolante forgate not to recommaunde hir to Surnome; and she and alle the ladies seide amonges them / that fferaunt was a notable knyght, and honorably had borne him, and was worthy to be renomed of alle othir that they knewe / On the morow erly the knightes departid, and spede them so, that withyn litil while they came to fferaunt, of whos comyng he <MILESTONE N="62, bk."

Than he told hem hou le Surnome receyued Athis vnto his company / and in what maner he came / and hou ther was in Surnome noon envie / for he wold so gladly reporte the worthinesse and prowes of his felawe, that by his<EPB/><PB N="101"/>maner and speche it semed he tℏought him self, nor noon othre, comparable vnto him / and reputed him self right ewrous that god had sent him suche a felawe / and than reherced he grete armes that the two felawes had done duryng the sege / and the drede that their enemyes had of theim, and of the grete comfort and hardinesse that his company toke in theim: and thorugℏ their grete worthinesse the Towne was double encoraged / Thies tidynges tolde he to þe knyghtes of Sizile, <MILESTONE N="63" UNIT="leaf"/>wherof they thought grete meruaile, and Iuged for trouthe that god had sente them this meruailous fortune, for sauacion of the realme / And so shewed it weel; "for they that no thinge were worth / thorugh theim be at this day as valiaunt as men can fynde / and they that no thinge dred vs, be at this day the moost failyng and wrecchid nacion that lyueth; and parde this werke may not be without miracle."  with suche language passed forth the day til the houre that they had taken to assemble agein in counselle, at whiche tyme Le Sournome was sent for to come amonges them / and at his comyng was the matier alle newly reherced / like as ye herde before, seyng vnto Le Surnome, that the kyng had gyuen them in charge to haue his aduise &amp; agrement theryn.  fferaunt had weel remembred the matier / and seid ther vnto the knyghtes, "ye se weele in what caas we be / and the gretest harme that we endure, is the prisoners that ben here, þat gretely dispende our vitaile / hou be it, y thanke god we be yet reasonably weel purvaide / wherfore it shalle not nede the kynge to haue no drede of vs / but that we shalle be able to abide them lenger than shal be their ease to lye aboute vs / &amp; y purpose to put those that be noble men to fynaunce / and to put the tothir to dethe; and by this meane shalle oure vitaile endure vs lenger.  And as touchyng your charge of puttyng kynge ffirabrace to fynaunce / y shal sone say as y thinke / suche thinge may befalle that the kynge wold for no thing had put him to ffynaunce.

The kynge of Scottes was not brought to the stake that day, nor the Turke nother / the trumpetes sowned, the listes were closed.  The kynge of fraunce wende to haue passid as he did the day before / but fferaunt came bifore him / and tolde him the crye &amp; ordenaunce of themperour.

The Emperour coude no lenger kepe him on his scaffold, but came downe, and lepe an hors bak, and came to embrace Le Surnome, his special frende &amp; seruaunt.

Themperour thought this fortune a miracle; wherfore he made alle the belles of the towne to be rongen / and toke the kynge by the hande, &amp; brought him to the chirche / and euery man thankid god, that by his grace he had sent thise iij. kynges to their recouere, and releef of the cristen feith / and alle the straungers that herd therof, yaue god a grete lawde, holdyng it for a very miracle / Frensshmen, that had recouerd their kyng / and knewe for trouthe it was the same <MILESTONE N="116" UNIT="leaf"/>that was named Le Surnome, that had done so grete a wele to the realme of Sizile, of whom the renome spred thorugh alle the world / thankid god as hertly, and with a grete ioie, as was possible / Than brought themperour the kynge of ffraunce to se the ladies / whiche coude not refrayne their lokes fro him while he was there, sauf the faire and good Iolant, whiche was so wele assured in euery manere, whiche bihelde him with suche wommanhode and wisdom, that neither he nor noon othir shold perceyue hir thought, al-be-it she had not leste pleasir to behold him / In like wise was he as wele assured, for he thought than no place nor tyme couenable to shewe that moost touchid his hert / But whan he might, he toke leve of themperour to chaunge him, and aftir soper to come agein to se the ladies.  The emperour made to speke vnto him secretly / that he and his vncle shold come suppe with the ladies / In like wise warned he the kynge of England and of Scottes.  The kynge of ffraunce agreed to his commaundement without any grugge / for there was no-thinge that he desired so moche, as to be in the company of somme that shold be ther.  Thus departed he, and toke fferaunt by the arme, wold he or not / and so went with him, arme in arme, thorugh the towne, til he came to his logging / where as they made grete ioie / and talked of many thinges passed / and so drave fortℏ, til tyme came they shold go to soper to the Emperour / than departed they fro his loggyng til he came to themperour, whiche was accompanyed with the kynges afore rehersed.

This faire lady, how moche so euer she was reioised in hir thought, hir maner was suche that no man coude perceyue it; on the tothir side, the kynge of ffraunce, in beholdynge hir, trustid as wele to performe the iijde. day as he had begone; wherthorugh he was so ravissht with ioie, that he neither eete ne dranke / Aftir soper, bifore the comynge of othir kynges and princis / the kynge of ffraunce talked with the faire Iolante / and askid hir, by hir feith, so many noble Princis as were at this assemble / if there were not one more than anothir in hir grace / for any thynge that he coude do / he coude perceyue by no wordes of hir / but that alle hir hert &amp; wille was at the pleasir of hir ffadir / seyng also she was right ioyfulle of the grete estate that he was yn, prayng god to sende him asmoche honour &amp; ioie as he coude wisshe / he thankid hir ful humbly / and askid hir / if god gaf him that fortune to come to the mariage of / if she wold not so be aswele content as with a-nothir / she chaunged colour, &amp; saide, "God gif hir grace to lyue no lenger than she be content with hym / that pleasith hir fadir to yeue hir, were it be he, or any othir." with thise wordes came yn many othir kynges and princes to themperours Court.  The kynge of ffraunce, of Englond, and of Scottes, went to mette them / and brought them yn to the ladies; the mynstralles pleide so many / that alle the halle resounded / the daunces began / The kynge of ffraunce toke this faire lady, his maistresse, by the hande, and daunced with hir / euery body behelde them gladly / And themperour and the Duc of Burgoigne talked togedir / and behelde this goodly couple dauncyng: "fforsothe," seid the Emperour / "here is a mete couple / god, by his grace, preserue them long" / "fforsothe" / said the Duc / "If it please you to make the mariage, I trowe ye shalle displeasen<EPB/><PB N="195"/>them neither" / "fforsothe," seid themperour, "if it please the kynge to take my doughtir / noon shall haue hir but he / By the ordenaunce of this Tournay, no man̄ [can] clayme hir of right / but if he wynne alle the iij. daies / <MILESTONE N="117" UNIT="leaf"/>and that can noman do but he / and though he do not / if it please him to haue hir, I woƚƚ be right ioyfulƚ, ffor he hath deserued a grettir rewarde / yif it were in me to yeue it him; for y hode myn honour and this Realme, only by god and him" / euery man that was in the halle spake of this matier / and in their mynde gaf this faire lady to the kynge of ffraunce.
