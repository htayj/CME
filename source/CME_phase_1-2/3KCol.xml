Horstmann indexes his variants to the line numbers of his own printed text, which have not been retained here.  Thus these numbers (1-36 for each page) no longer refer to precisely identifiable segments of text, but can still be useful in directing the reader to the approximate location of a word or passage on a given page.  To make such reference easier, the back matter has been divided into paragraphs corresponding to the page references of Horstmann's main text.  Horstmann's own paragraph divisions for the variant readings have been retained as well.</P><P>The printed edition's synoptic marginal gloss and the text of the Latin version have been omitted (Horstmann's notes referring to the Latin text have been retained, however).</P><P>All chapter headings for the first, Cambridge, MS appear as they are in the printed text; a few have been supplied by Horstmann and so appear in brackets that replace the parentheses or brackets he placed around these heads (e.g., [Cap. xxiiii]).  By contrast, the second, Royal, MS has no chapter headings in the printed text; therefore, we have supplied all of them in the electronic edition.  Most of the divisions in the Royal manuscript, called "sections" in the electronic edition, correspond with the chapter breaks in the Cambridge MS.  In five instances (pp. 25, 69, 95, 139, 153), section breaks occur in the Royal MS that do not mark chapter breaks in the Cam. MS; these have been left without heads.</P><P>There are two places where a milestone marker in the Cambridge MS splits a word. In one instance we have joined the word: p. 56, leaf 9b — "Chal/deys" appears as Chaldeys before the milestone break.  The slash shows where the milestone breaks the word in the MS. This editorial intervention is designed to facilitate word searches while also preserving the integrity of the MS folio breaks.  In the second instance,  p. 54, leaf 9a —"to-gedir," we have retained the hyphen as in the printed edition. Horstmann did not supply milestones for the Royal MS, and therefore they are absent in the electronic edition. Finally, words broken by a page break have been joined and placed before the page break.</P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE N="Latin" ID="l">Latin</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE N="German" ID="g">German</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE N="Dutch" ID="dut">Dutch</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE N="French" ID="f">French</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE N="Danish" ID="dan">Danish</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE N="Spanish" ID="s">Spanish</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE N="Italian" ID="i">Italian</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE></PROFILEDESC></HEADER><TEXT><FRONT><TITLEPAGE><EPB/><PB N="[i]"/><DOCTITLE><TITLEPART>The Three Kings of Cologne.</TITLEPART><TITLEPART>AN EARLY ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THE <FOREIGN LANG="l">"HISTORIA TRIUM REGUM"</FOREIGN></TITLEPART></DOCTITLE><BYLINE>BY<DOCAUTHOR>JOHN OF HILDESHEIM.</DOCAUTHOR></BYLINE><BYLINE>EDITED FROM THE MSS., TOGETHER WITH THE LATIN TEXT, <LB/>BY<LB/><DOCAUTHOR>C.

The existing MSS. can be divided into 3 groups: 1. MS. Royal, 18 A X, fol. 87, and Cott. Vespas., E. XVI, a literal copy of the former, though written by a northmidland scribe.  2. MS. Cambr. Univ. Libr., Ee IV, 2; Cott. Titus A XXV, and Douce 301; MS. at Bedford (written in 1442); Patrik Papers 43; Cambr. Kk 1, 3; Ashm. 59.  3. MS. Harl. 1704.  Of these, MS. Vesp. is incomplete at the end (it ends, fol. 69, with "mete to," = Royal, p. 153, 24); Douce wants the first and the last, and several other leaves; Harl. 3 leaves, in Chapters 26, 32, and at the end; in MS. Cambr. Ee the first page is unreadable from blackness.  Nearly all these MSS. belong to the 15th century. Besides, there exist several old prints, by W. de Worde: London, 1499? (date om.), 1511 (title: The thre Kynges of Coleyne, Imprynted MCCCCCXI), 1526 (Imprynted at London in Fletestrete at the sygne of the sonne by Wynkyn de Worde, The yere of our lorde god MCCCCCI and XXVI), 1530 (Colophon: This was brought unto me in englysshe of an olde translacyon rugh and rude, and requyred to amend it, I thought lesse labour to wryte newe the whole.  I beseche you take all unto the best and praye for the olde wretched brother of Syon Rycharde Whytforde), and an edition without date (Emprynted at Westmester by Wynkyn de Worde).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1">The Brit. Mus. has only the ed. of 1499, an imperfect copy of which is in the Bodl.  It is based on the text of MS. Cambr., showing the same omissions, but it alters freely.  A copy of the 2nd ed. is extant in Cambr., Public libr.</NOTE1></P><P>None of the existing MSS. contains the original text: they are all transcripts, and more or less corrupted.  The 2nd group 

<EPB/><PB N="vi"/>
comprehends the generally-received text, and that which, in contents and arrangement, is most in accordance with the Latin source; but the existing MSS. are frequently bad, and differ much.  On the other side, MS. Royal (1st group), carefully written and executed, with Latin marginal notes, is of older date (beginning of the 15th century); its readings are generally the best, its language and dialect very nearly original.  But its arrangement in some parts (p. 69-78; 145, 24-152), contrary to the Latin source, and without apparent reason, is such as can hardly be deemed original.  The initials of most chapters differ from those in the other MSS., and on closer examination it appears that they have been altered on purpose, and that forced turns and circumscriptions are employed for the sake of obtaining certain initials.  There must be some reason for that: indeed, if the initials of the 32 first chapters are put together, we get MARGARETA MONINGTOWN, MAWDE STRANLEA, (then follow AA; the rest are the same as in the other MSS.).  In the same way Osbern Bokenham has deposited his name in his <FOREIGN LANG="l">"Mappula Angliæ"</FOREIGN> (which I have lately edited from MS. Harl. 4011, in <FOREIGN LANG="g">"Engl. Studien,"</FOREIGN> 1886).  But in the case of MS. Royal I cannot be brought to believe those 2 female names, Margaret Moningtown and Mawde Stranlea, to be those of the first authors, as their names are obviously forced upon an earlier text; they must be either the compilers of this single version, or the dedicatees.  The text of MS. Royal has many additions, partly from the Latin source (p. 41; 59; 77; 79; 113; 117), partly from a note<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS2">The same note is already extant in MS. Berol. Fol. 47 (a copy of the Brandenburg MS.. wr. 1413).</NOTE1> added at the end of the Latin text in MSS. Corp. Chr. Coll. Cbr. 275, and Cleop. D VII (p. 37; 47), partly from other sources (p. 27; 29; 31); whereas in other cases it leaves out or abridges (f. i. p. 23-5; 39-41, and often), as sometimes, also, when the sense was doubtful (as p. 3). For these reasons I cannot believe MS. Royal to contain the primitive text; it is rather to be regarded as a separate version, made after a first text.</P><P>Of the MSS. of the 2nd group, MS. Cambr. Ee<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS3">The same MS. contains a Chronicle of England, from the earliest times, written by the same hand, after the 3 Kings.</NOTE1> is the best and 
<EPB/><PB N="vii"/>
nearest in language to MS. Royal; yet it is not without mistakes, and skips some lines.  MS. Bedford descends, though not immediately, from MS. Cbr., as it shows the same omissions and mistakes, which, however, with many more of an intermediate MS., it supplies and corrects on its own account, and rather foolishly, so making the text worse.  These, and many other voluntary "corrections," render this text almost useless.  MS. Tit. and MS. Douce form a subdivision of this group: they have not the omissions of MS. Cbr., and are, therefore, derived from an older MS.; but they are later and more corrupt.  Both have a large gap within the text, p. 140, 34-148, owing, no doubt, to the loss of several leaves in an earlier MS., where the gap seems to have extended still farther, from p. 140, 31-150, 2, as the passage on p. 148, and p. 140, 31-34, are supplied in both MSS. by a new and verbal translation of the Latin text made, it seems, to fill up this part of the gap.  Both MSS., closely related, are, however, independent of each other, and are copied from a third MS. of the same kind; sometimes MS. Tit., sometimes MS. Douce has the preference.  MS. Patrik Papers is late, but derived from a good MS. of the 2nd group.  MS. Kk is late, and very bad; it alters and adds freely, and is, therefore, of little use; so is MS. Ashm.  MS. Harl. (3rd group), late, and frequently corrupt, joins the 2nd group, but shows traces of an older text, and has, besides, not a few additions from the Latin source, some of which are found in MS. Royal, some in no other MS., so that it stands apart from the rest.  When these additions were made, it will be difficult to decide, but most likely they are taken from the oldest text.  I have given these additions beside the Cbr. text.</P><P>Perhaps some more MSS. will yet turn up, which will throw greater light on the history of the text.  As it is, the text is far from being correct and clear, even in the best MSS.  The first text, which seems to have been more complete, has been lost.  This first text, difficult, and frequently obscure, on account of the difficulties of the Latin text, and the bad state of the MS. (Corp. Chr. Coll. Cbr., 275) from which it was translated, was, it seems, unsatisfactory, and became soon corrupted; and the more so, as the legend became popular, and was frequently copied.  The existing MSS. are so many <EPB/><PB N="viii"/>stages in this growing corruption.  MS. Royal is quite another version, made soon after, and from, the first text, with additions (in the homiletic part), and omissions (in the descriptive part),<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS4">This is explained by the fact that this version was made by, or made for, holy Sisters; for such are, of course, the females expressed in the initials.</NOTE1> so that it could be given out as a new version; but the bulk of the text, where it coincides with the other MSS., is still in a better state, though sometimes difficulties are disposed of by simply skipping them (as on p. 3).  MS. Harl., it seems, has saved some of the additions of the first text.  The other MSS. contain the substance of the first text in a state of decomposition, with many omissions of lines and passages, or even (as in Tit. and Douce) with wholesale gaps, and with difficulties which have become inextricable (as in Chapt. 1).  Sometimes recurrence was made to the Latin source, to fill up gaps (as in Tit. and Douce), but rarely or never, to amend the text.  The same source had been consulted in MS. Royal, to add new matter; but that the plus of the 2nd group (and of Harl.) should be due to a later revision with the Latin original, instead of emanating from the first text, is quite improbable.</P><P>As the oldest MSS. go down to the beginning of the 15th century, the first translation can be dated about (rather before than after) 1400.  With this date harmonizes the style, which is still heavy and embarrassed.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS5">So in the repetition of the noun with the relative, of the pers. pron. after the subject, of þan after whan, &amp;c.;, in the repetition of the same subst. after an intermission, as p. 31, 14, and þat tyme þat we clepe cristemasse, þei clepe .. þat same tyme þe tyme of herbes, 33, 31, þan þis sterre þat was prophecyed ... þe same nyȝt and þe same howre þat god was bore þe same sterre bygan arise, 86, 2; 127, 2; especially in relative sentences when the rel. in the genit. depends on a substantive in an oblique case: 47, 27, a sercle þe which in þe hiȝest partie of þis sercle (<FOREIGN LANG="l">in cuius summitate</FOREIGN>), 63, 22, þei dispised Crist whan he was bore, whom long tyme tofore þei wyst &amp; prophecyed of hys birþe, or after a praeposition: 39, 20, þat sterre þat was so long tyme prophecyed afore and þat aƚƚ þe pepil had so longe abyde and loke after þis sterre, 127, 15; 51, 32, þat kyndely resoun scheweþ hit to a man (<FOREIGN LANG="l">cui humana ratio praebet experimentum</FOREIGN>), 65, 3, þe scheperdes to þe which þe angel apperyd and schewed to hem þe berþe of Crist; in the frequent repetition of the same words (55, 22, of þis towne .. in þat town .. in þat same litil town); in the repetition of the same thesis, as 21, 11; 97, 23; 115, 34.</NOTE1>  The dialect of MS. Royal, and, though less pure, of MS. Cbr. Ee, is South-midland;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS6">The dialect shows rare endings in en in the plur. pres. and pret., whereas the past part. is without ending (as do, knowe); 3 sgl. ends in eþ.  It prefers i in the ending is in the plur. of substantives, ir (aftir, wondir), id, iþ (but rarely in).  Hous, plaas. trespas, are plurals.  The pronouns are she--her, þei-- hem, poss. her.  The indef. art. is a, even before vowels.  The pret. of to see is saiȝ, pl. siȝe; the plur. of shal is shul, of have sometimes han.  þat, demonst., is used as plur.  Adverbs end in lich (gretlich).  It writes any, man, whan, hande, vndirstonde, first, liche, ferþer, moche (Cbr. mochel), naȝt or nat, &amp;c.; It uses clepe (not calle), ȝede, betwix.  The language is that of the close of the 14th century.  The dialectic differences of the other MSS. are given in the Various readings.</NOTE1> and this, most likely, 






<EPB/><PB N="ix"/>
was also the dialect of the first text.  In the later MSS. the scribes have mixed the forms of their respective dialects: MS. Vesp. shows North-midland forms; Tit. and Douce are written by midland scribes, MS. Bedford in an East-midland district.  The author of the English version is unknown.  MS. Ashm. gives out (in the title) that it was "translated oute of latyne in to Englisshe by þe grettest doctours of our nacioun, licenced by þe chirche."  This is merely a supposition of the scribe, taken, it seems, from the English translation of Leg. aurea, where the same title is used.  As to the version of MS. Royal, it may have been arranged by Marg. Moningtown and Maude Stranlea; at least there are more instances of female authors in that time, as f. i. the well-known Juliana Barnes (or Berners), who, being abbess at Sopewell, near St. Albans, wrote "the bokys of Hawkyng and Huntyng and also of Cootarmures" (ed. St. Albans, 1486).</P><P>The English legend is an abridged translation of the Latin <FOREIGN LANG="l">"Historia SS. trium Regum,"</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS7">It has different titles in the MSS. and prints: <FOREIGN LANG="l">Historia trium Regum, Liber trium Regum, Liber de gestis et translacionibus t.

famous work <FOREIGN LANG="l">"Primitae gentium sive historia et encomium SS. trium Magorum evangelicorum,"</FOREIGN> Colon. 1654, fol., scorns to mention it.  The first who discovered a MS. of it, and the name of the author, in 1818, was Göthe,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS9">He wrote on it to Sulpiz Boisserée, from Jena, 22 Oct., 1818 (cf. Sulpiz Boiss.

He says of it: <FOREIGN LANG="g">"In's Deutsche übersetzt schlösse sich das büchlein unmittelbar an die Volksbücher: denn es ist für die menge erfunden und geschrieben, die sich, ohne den kritischen zahn zu wetzen, an allem erfreut was der einbildungskraft anmutig geboten wird. und so sind die einzelheiten durchaus allerliebst und mit heiterem pinsel ausgemalt."</FOREIGN></NOTE1> who speaks of it in high praise.

Simrock found a German translation of 1389, dedicated to <FOREIGN LANG="g">"Frau Elsbeth von Katzenellenbogen, Herrin von Erlbach,"</FOREIGN> in a MS. at Basle (Univ. Libr. 58).

Chapter at Przemysl (<FOREIGN LANG="g">"Hystoria von de heilig drein Kuning,"</FOREIGN> Wien, <FOREIGN LANG="g">Mechitharisten Buchdruckerei,</FOREIGN> 1857).  A MS. at Heidelberg (Cod.

Brand., though with many alterations); here the biblical part is only intimated, not executed, the digressions are mostly abridged or sketched, or wholly omitted, the style is simple and clear, so that it looks like a first draught, though some of the omissions are mentioned in the index.  The vast majority of the MSS. contain a widely-enlarged text, in which all the details are broadly executed, and many digressions added, in a style made pompous by accumulations, doublings and treblings of words, circumlocutions and repetitions, so that the clear sense is stifled under verbosity, and frequently obscured.  The latter became the generally-received text, and was printed in the old editions.  It seems that the former version contains the first text, from which the wider was formed; but it is to be noted that some of the very oldest MSS. already contain the wider text.  I must leave this question open till I have collated the MSS. extant at Munich; nor can I attempt, as yet, to give a critical edition of the Latin text; I must content myself here with reprinting the Brandenb. text (which I have collated with the MS., and with MS. Berol. Fol. 47), and with adding the readings of the common text, especially of the MSS. extant in England (MS. Cleop. D VII and Corp. Chr. Coll. Cbr. 275), as being of importance for the English version.  Both MSS. have the enlarged text, but with a great many variations and omissions, of which those in MS. Corp. Chr.

These Hebrew and Chaldaic books are, no doubt, a mere fiction, or perhaps mention was made of them in his real sources.</P><P>The legendary part is taken from the Bible, which is literally reproduced (in the enlarged text), and from the Fathers, from common traditions and well-known facts.

Aurea</FOREIGN> (c. 1280) in the Sermon on Epiph. contains a former stage of the legend, with much homiletic matter; but it only briefly mentions the transl. by St. Helena and Eustorgius.  John of Hild. seems not to have made immediate use of it.  Similar is the account in the German <FOREIGN LANG="g">"Marienpassionale"</FOREIGN>(ed. Augsburg 1476, Appendix).--The Old-Spanish <FOREIGN LANG="s">"Libre de los tres Reys"</FOREIGN> (in <FOREIGN LANG="s">Sanchez Colleccion</FOREIGN>, Madr. 1841, p. 125-132), contains only the adoration of the 3 Kings and the flight to Egypt (with the adventure of the robbers from the <FOREIGN LANG="s">Infancia Salv.</FOREIGN>).</NOTE1>  The subject of the 3 Kings was one of the favourite topics of the day; they were at that time the most popular saints of Christendom, their festival was solemnized with uncommon mirth and splendour, with personations within church,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS27">These personations, which dramatize the liturgy of the day, first given in Latin in the short words of the Bible by the clergy alone, as a part of the service, but gradually dilating and passing over to the laity, form one of the first elements in the history of the mediæval drama.  The oldest specimens in Latin are those of Limoges, Rouen (<FOREIGN LANG="l">"Officium Stellae"</FOREIGN>), Nevers (two), Compiègne, Freisingen, Orleans (cf. Du Méril, <FOREIGN LANG="f">"Origines Lat. du Théatre moderne,"</FOREIGN>Paris, 1849; Delisle, <FOREIGN LANG="l">"Romania,"</FOREIGN> 1875; M. Hartmann, l. c., p. 7 ff.; Th. Wright, "Early Mysteries and other Lat. poems of the 12th and 13th cent." Lond., 1838); they are extant in MSS. of the 11th and 12th cent.; the oldest specimen in a national idiom is an Old-Spanish play (last ed. by M. Hartmann, l. c., p. 46).  These plays soon became very popular.  German plays have been collected by Weinhold, <FOREIGN LANG="g">"Weihnachtsspiele und Lieder,"</FOREIGN> Gräz, 1853; Schröer, <FOREIGN LANG="g">"Deutsche Weihnachtsspiele aus Ungarn,"</FOREIGN> Vienna, 1861; in <FOREIGN LANG="l">"Carmina burana,"</FOREIGN>Stuttg., 1847; cf. Wilken, <FOREIGN LANG="g">"Gesch. der geistl. Spiele in Deutschland,"</FOREIGN> Gött., 1872. <FOREIGN LANG="g">"Dreikönigsspiele"</FOREIGN> were frequent at Cologne (cf. Crombach, 732), Hildesheim (cf. Floss, 99), Milan (Floss, 63), and indeed in all places where the 3 Kings were specially worshipped, as also in Burgundy, where the 3 Kings passed on their translation to Cologne (cf. Floss, p. 100).--On the influence of the legend on art see Mrs. Jameson, "Legends of the Madonna," London, 1857, p. 210--223.</NOTE1> with mummeries and plays without; their shrine at Cologne was one of the centres of the Christian world, the very fame and wealth of Cologne dated from their translation.  To fix the traditions then current, to have the "legend" of the great national Saints, to have it complete, with all the 


<EPB/><PB N="xvi"/>
apparatus then required in a legend, in a form befitting the subject, had become a task of national interest.  John of Hildesheim undertook this task, for which he was eminently qualified.  He had travelled in France and Italy, had been near the papal court at Avignon and Rome, and had, no doubt, acquired much information, unknown as yet to the general public; he had been <FOREIGN LANG="l">"biblicus"</FOREIGN> at Paris, he had wide connections.  His was not a critical age; he took his materials where and how he found them, without scrupulously examining their authenticity; the marvellous was then indispensable to a legend, and received with a credulous mind, especially when Eastern subjects were concerned.  Nevertheless, it remains astonishing how he got all his information together: and the question arises whether he has not sometimes added of his own inventions.  On the whole, I am not inclined to assert this point, and to think him capable of real falsifications; though perhaps he has sometimes been led away by his imagination and too freely made use of his power of combination, as in the history of the 30 gilt pennies, of the apple of gold, &amp;c.;, which seem to be of very recent date, and almost to have been expressly made for the occasion; but perhaps a tradition was already afloat, analogous to that of the crown of thorns at Paris.  In all cases, his credulity is rather stupendous; he takes everything in good earnest, without a trace of irony.</P><P>The most interesting part of his book is the many digressions which he has dispersed among the narrative: descriptions of countries, places, products, events, customs, churches and sects in the East; these "allotria" take up more than half of the book.  Here he has laid down all the information then known of the East.  Some of the details he may have learned at Cologne, which, since the crusades, had been the centre of commerce to the Orient, others at Avignon and Rome; but his chief sources were the books of travels, frequent at that age of pilgrimages to the Holy Land.

Rainald got the bodies clandestinely from a noble Milanese, before asking them of the Emperor, is a mere tradition, first recorded in the <FOREIGN LANG="l">Annales Egmondani</FOREIGN> (13th cent.), a. 1167 (Pertz Scr., XVI, 465), which, however, still omit the name of the nobleman; this name, Azzo de Turri (or della Torre, which was one of the most powerful families in Milan in the 13th cent.), does not appear before John of Hildesheim (cf. Floss, p. 71 ff.).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS37">A later account is that given in Crombach: that the sister of a Milanese nobleman (Gualfegus, Gualvagno Visconte, Count of Angleria) betrayed the bodies to Rainald, to save her brother; this account was enhanced by many fabulous details; cf.

The same account is told in the 2nd part of the German poem, <FOREIGN LANG="g">"Zeno oder die Leg. von den h. 3 Königen."</FOREIGN></NOTE1>  What is told of their prior translations, rests on traditions no older, it seems, than the last translation; the chief source is the <FOREIGN LANG="l">Vita b.

M.

It relates how St. Eustorgius, a native of Constantinople, and familiar with the Emperor, was sent to Milan on a mission, was made bishop by the Milanese, and obtained for them from the Emperor the bodies of the 3 Kings, which had once been brought from different countries to Constantinople by St. Helena;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS39">The same tradition, though in more general terms, is given in <FOREIGN LANG="l">Ann. Isengrimmi</FOREIGN>, who says that St. Helena brought the bodies to Constantinople, and that a bishop of Milan, who was at her court, acquired them, and brought them to Milan; he refers for it to <FOREIGN LANG="l">"historiae"</FOREIGN> extant at Cologne, which Floss believes to be the <FOREIGN LANG="l">Vita S. Eustorgii</FOREIGN>.  Rob. de Monte Cron. first names this bishop Eustorgius, to whom the bodies were given by an emperor of Byzance. Whether or no these two accounts of contemporaries to the last translation are older than the <FOREIGN LANG="l">Vita Eust.</FOREIGN>, is a matter of dispute.  That the tradition was not then generally received, is proved by William of Newburgh (1136-1208), who says: <FOREIGN LANG="l">"Nec notum est a quibus personis sacrae illorum reliquiae illuc (Mediolanum) delatae ibique repositae fuerint"</FOREIGN> (a second MS., however, differs in the readings); and by Albericus Chron. (ab. 1250), a. 1163: <FOREIGN LANG="l">"De Perside autem qualiter corpora Constantinopolim fuissent translata, hucusque non reperi"</FOREIGN>; cf. M. Hartmann, l. c. p. 73.</NOTE1> as bishop, he was the second (third) predecessor of St. <EPB/><PB N="xx"/>
Ambrose, and lies buried "in the venerable church of the 3 Kings, which since bears his name also."  The account in the MS. at the Hague, 269, which embodies the traditions current at Cologne, repeats the same story, but adds the name of the Emperor, Manuel. John of Hildesheim combines a double relation: "it is said" (<FOREIGN LANG="l">fertur</FOREIGN>), he says, "that at the instance (<FOREIGN LANG="l">concilio</FOREIGN>) of the Emperor Mauricius (who is called <FOREIGN LANG="l">'primus imperator Romanorum ex Graecis'</FOREIGN>), the bodies were translated to Milan, for it had assisted him in recovering Greece and Armeny, then laid waste by the Saracens and Persians;" "and it is read (<FOREIGN LANG="l">legitur</FOREIGN>) that this translation was made under Manuel by St. Eustorgius."  Here we see how the tradition, which sprang from the discovery of the bodies, was gradually enlarged.  The name of Manuel was added, because the name of this Emperor (who reigned 1143-1180) was then best known for a Greek Emperor.  St. Ambrose, though he mentions St. Eustorgius, knows nothing of the translation of the 3 Kings, nor does Paulinus, the biographer of St. Ambrose.  As the whole story of the translation by St. Eustorgius is, most likely, a late invention, owing to the discovery of the bodies in his church, it is needless to attempt explaining how they came to Milan.

This is a most fabulous account, relating how one Zeno, son of a rich citizen of Verona of the same name, but who, at his birth, is brought to a bishop of Milan by the devil, who lays himself in the cradle in his stead, after many strange adventures got the bodies of the 3 Kings with the help of the devil.  This strange story is of the same kind as that of the "heilige Rock" at Treves.  Perhaps it rests on the tradition of the ducat of Zeno in St. Eustorgio's.</NOTE1> (474-491), of whom a ducat, said to have been found in the ark in which the 3 Kings were

But the traditions extant in St. Eustorgio's respecting the 3 Kings, seem only to have arisen consequently to the discovery of the bodies, nor can it be proved that it bore the name of Church of the 3 Kings before that date (cf. Floss, p. 61 ff.).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS42">Since 1220 St. Eustorgio's belonged to the Dominicans; cf.
