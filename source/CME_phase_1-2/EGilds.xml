All material, including front matter, is included, and is represented in the electronic edition as it was in the print edition (so far as is possible).</P><P>In keeping with local practice, we have designated a section of text as "supplied" if it was supplied by the editor, Toulmin Smith, for the printed edition.  We have designated a section of text as "added" or "deleted" if the addition or deletion was made by a scribe in the manuscript version.</P><P>All material that appears in brackets has been supplied by the editor.  Many documents in this collection are accompanied by extensive commentary by the editor Toulmin Smith.  He customarily introduces a document with a note that includes an inventory number, a word about the document's condition and its language.  These notes are usually short and accordingly appear as notes to be clicked on.  Sometimes he includes very long introductory notes that are also tagged as notes.  Those longer notes that are presented as a part of the main page of text in the printed edition have been retained as part of the main flow of electronic, their textual divisions (or divs) labeled as "note."  Notes that follow a document or set of documents are often entitled "Note" or "General Note," and again we have retained these in their original form in a div from the document itself. </P><P>In a few instances we have supplied some heads to clarify the nature of the text that follows.  These include the "Editor's Introductions" to the three main sections (pp. 2, 126, 348), as well as "Rules of Pleading" (p. 360).</P><P>We have not preserved the use of superscripted characters for the most common instances, including y<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1>, y<HI1 REND="sup">s</HI1>, y<HI1 REND="sup">t</HI1>, w<HI1 REND="sup">t</HI1>, and w<HI1 REND="sup">th</HI1>. </P><P>To facilitate electronic searches, words separated across a page break in the print edition are given in full before the page break in the electronic edition.  The actual print edition page breaks or milestones for primary documents are as follows: <LIST><ITEM>pp. 6-7, "syk/nesse"</ITEM><ITEM>pp. 155-6, "two/pence"</ITEM><ITEM>pp. 187-8, "espe/ciall"</ITEM><ITEM>pp. 196-7, "posses/siones"</ITEM><ITEM>pp. 248-9, "pos/sessions"</ITEM><ITEM>pp. 260-1, "Sacra/mentalls"</ITEM></LIST></P><P>Where the figure "xx," signifying "score," appears superscript above a series of Roman numerals, the word "score" has been substituted for the "xx," which is difficult to represent electronically.  Smith provides the following note on the figure (p. 199):  "This figure, and those in same style which follow it, are here printed as they are written.  The "xx" above the first Roman figures means a <HI1 REND="i">score</HI1>.  Thus we get four score and seven, = 87; four score and thirteen, = 93; one hundred, four score, and two,=182."</P><P>Pages 212-19 contain a Latin text with a facing-page English translation.  We have encoded the original text and its translation as separate sections of text, so the user will notice that the Latin text has only even-numbered page numbers and the English text only odd-numbered page numbers.</P><P>In the fourth note to page 355 are two symbols which we are incapable of transmitting electronically.  The first is line drawing of a finger pointing to the left and the second a symbol which resembles a dollar-sign, but backwards.  Where these should appear in the note they have been replaced by brief bracketed descriptions, supplied by HTI.</P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE ID="LAT">Latin</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE ID="OE">Old English</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE ID="FRE">French</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE ID="GRE">Greek</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE ID="GER">German</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE></PROFILEDESC></HEADER><TEXT><FRONT><TITLEPAGE><EPB/><PB N="[iii]"/><DOCTITLE><TITLEPART><HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1></TITLEPART><TITLEPART>THE ORIGINAL ORDINANCES OF MORE THAN<LB/>ONE HUNDRED EARLY ENGLISH GILDS<LB/>TOGETHER WITH<LB/><HI1 REND="i">Þe olde Vsages of þe Cite of Wynchestre<LB/>The Ordinances of Worcester<LB/>The Office of the Mayor of Bristol</HI1><LB/>AND <LB/><HI1 REND="i">The Costomary of the Manor of Tettenhall-Regis</HI1><LB/>from manuscripts of the<LB/>Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries</TITLEPART></DOCTITLE><BYLINE>EDITED, WITH, NOTES, BY <DOCAUTHOR>TOULMIN SMITH</DOCAUTHOR></BYLINE><BYLINE>WITH AN INTRODUCTION AND GLOSSARY, ETC., BY <DOCAUTHOR>LUCY TOULMIN SMITH</DOCAUTHOR></BYLINE><BYLINE>AND A PRELIMINARY ESSAY ON THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF GILDS BY <DOCAUTHOR>LUJO BRENTANO</DOCAUTHOR></BYLINE><DOCIMPRINT><HI1 REND="i">Published for</HI1><LB/>THE EARLY ENGLISH TEXT SOCIETY<LB/><HI1 REND="i">by the</HI1><PUBLISHER>OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS</PUBLISHER><PUBPLACE>LONDON</PUBPLACE><PUBPLACE>NEW YORK</PUBPLACE><PUBPLACE>TORONTO</PUBPLACE><EPB/><PB N="[iv]"/>FIRST PUBLISHED<DOCDATE>1870</DOCDATE></DOCIMPRINT></TITLEPAGE><DIV1 NODE="EGilds:1" TYPE="TOC"><EPB/><PB N="[v]"/><HEAD>CONTENTS.</HEAD><LIST><ITEM>INTRODUCTION             .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     <REF>xi</REF></ITEM><ITEM>PRELIMINARY ESSAY, "On the History and Development of Gilds and the Origin of Trade-Unions," by Dr. BRENTANO               <REF> xlix</REF><LIST><ITEM>Preface                  .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .  <REF> liii</REF></ITEM><ITEM>1.

A sorrow, in which its readers will share, that the hand which had laboured so long and so patiently was stayed ere its task was ended, that the work which should be the book he "desired to be remembered by" was yet unfinished when its author was suddenly called away, is but partly consoled by the thought that so much of that work as he had done is not lost, and that it has been at length completed, as far as might be, although by feebler hands. That it should be so completed, in a manner as much as possible worthy of the attention and care bestowed upon it by my father, has been my constant aim and endeavour; and I have had a melancholy satisfaction in filling in the rest of the outline design of this, the last labour of love undertaken by him, out of his devotion to Freedom and to the welfare of his fellow Englishmen.</P><P>A few words of explanation are due to many who have been long looking for the issue of this volume.  For some months before my father's death, in April of the present year, his illness had delayed the progress of the work.  Having long acted as his amanuensis, it seemed most natural afterwards that I should superintend the remainder in going through the press, rather than another, who might be an entire stranger to the papers and notes; <EPB/><PB N="xii"/>and even with this advantage, I had much to overcome in mastering all the details of the book.  Inexperience, and the results of a painful bereavement have, I fear, caused further delay; in short, a daughter's affection and reverence for her father's name are the strongest reasons I can offer for undertaking this myself, instead of yielding it up to other and more efficient hands.</P><P>It is right that I should state the position of the work at the time I took it up, in order to point out the authenticity of each portion.  The whole of Parts I. and II. were finished by my father, with the exception of a few trifling press corrections and short notes in the last ten pages.  The whole of the four Records contained in Part III. were in type, but of these, the Winchester "Usages" alone was nearly ready: all required careful collation and notes, most of them wanted the marginal abstract.  The Appendix I. was not in type.  Except in the case of the Ordinances of the Norwich Gild contained in the Appendix, which Mr. Parker of Oxford has been kind enough twice to collate for me, I have myself supplied all that was thus wanting, taking the utmost care to make the transcripts correct and trustworthy.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS3">Notes added by me are distinguished by the initials L.T.S.</NOTE1>  In the Glossary, which I have also compiled, I have had the advantage of the friendly advice of Mr. Richard Morris, who has moreover, at the request of Mr. Furnivall, been good enough to prepare the Grammatical Notes on the forms of early English here printed.</P><P>In the following short Introduction I attempt to sketch out, though I fear but imperfectly, some of the ideas that my father entertained upon the wide subject that is opened up by the present volume, and to give a slight abstract of its chief features.  In doing this, I have yielded to the desire of old and valued friends, who have urged that the point of view from which English Gilds and their history was regarded by one who was so thoroughly conversant with the life and spirit of English institutions, would be of the greatest interest, and that as he has unhappily left the intended Introduction unwritten, it would be well to throw his <EPB/><PB N="xiii"/>notes and materials into some shape.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS4">In several places throughout the book, reference is made to what "will be" said or found in the "Introduction."  On some of these points I have touched where it seemed fitting; others, feeling it impossible, I have not attempted to deal with.</NOTE1>  Besides notes made expressly for this purpose, I have availed myself of those made for two Lectures on the Records of England, delivered at Birmingham, in April, 1865, in which my father gave some account of the Records of the Gilds, and the pictures of their laws and customs therein discovered.</P><P>Several years ago, while following up some searches at the Public Record Office for the purposes of another work, my father's inquiries led to the bringing out of some hitherto almost unused bundles of documents,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS5">For a more particular description of these documents, see after, p. xlii.</NOTE1> which at once attracted his attention as connected with the subject of Gilds.  On fully looking these over, he found that they were of the highest interest, giving an amount of information, and throwing a light upon the history of the Gilds of England not anywhere else known.  He made a calendar, and careful notes of each one of the whole series, thus occupying the leisure hours of many months; and during the course of this study he became convinced that,—besides the value of the view of "manners, morals, and language of the time," which he considered one of the most complete in itself anywhere to be found,—these old Records possessed a value for the men and women of England of the present day, which ought to be made known.  In the midst of the perplexing problems presented by modern Trades-unionism, and the dangers to enterprise and manly liberty threatened by its restrictive rules, my father, who knew that Englishmen can "never appeal to their fathers in vain, when they earnestly invoke the spirit of solid freedom,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS6">T. S., <HI1 REND="i">Lecture I., on Records</HI1>; MS.</NOTE1> saw how the ancient principle of association, more than a thousand years old, had been in use as a living practice among the common folk, that it had been "a part of the essential life of England, and always worked well till forcibly meddled with;" and he believed that if the spirit in which those <EPB/><PB N="xiv"/>early fathers met together, prayed together, aided one another, their "faith in law-abidingness" and liberty, and their charity, could be shown to their brethren and sistren of these later days, it would not only bring closer to the present the hearts and hands of the past, with profit to themselves, but also the work would "by examples, give invaluable practical hints to sincere men" and workers now.</P><P>This volume is therefore the result of that conviction and desire. It does not seek to give a complete history of Gilds abroad and at home;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS7">The Essay on the <HI1 REND="i">History and Development of Gilds</HI1>, by Dr.  Brentano, of Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, who is about to write a large work on the subject, and who has thus embodied some of the early chapters for this book, is here inserted by the desire of Mr.  Furnivall.  The value of independent historical research and opinion is evident; I must add, however, that this gentleman had no communication whatever with my father, to whom he was quite unknown, and who therefore will not be held responsible for views differing much on some points from his own.</NOTE1> nor does it profess to give lists of all the Gilds known in past times in England (interesting and useful though these might be), it does not even give the whole of the documents found in the bundles at the Record Office; its aim has been to put forth a true view of the early English Gilds, what they were, and what they did, by letting their own Records speak for them.  And to help in this, the several other Records contained in Part III. were added, as—besides being instructive in themselves—illustrating the outward relations of the Gilds with other Institutions of the land, and the development in other shapes of the same principles of free action upon the vitality of which the Gild depends.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS8">See after, p. 348.</NOTE1></P><MILESTONE N="_____________________" UNIT="typographic"/><P>The early English Gild was an institution of local self-help which, before Poor-laws were invented, took the place, in old times, of the modern friendly or benefit society; but with a higher aim, while it joined all classes together in a care for the needy and for objects of common welfare, it did not neglect the forms and the practice of Religion, Justice, and Morality.</P><P>"'Gilds' were associations of those living in the same neighbourhood, and remembering that they have, as neighbours, common<EPB/><PB N="xv"/>obligations.  They were quite other things than modern partnerships, or trading 'Companies;' for their main characteristic was, to set up something higher than personal gain and mere materialism, as the main object of men living in towns; and to make the teaching of love to one's neighbour be not coldly accepted as a hollow dogma of morality, but known and felt as a habit of life."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS9"><HI1 REND="i">Traditions of the Old Crown House</HI1>, by Toulmin Smith, p. 28.  Birmingham, 1863.</NOTE1>  They were the out-come, in another form, of the same spirit of independence and mutual help which also made our Old English fathers join together in the <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"Frith-borh"</FOREIGN> or Peace-pledge, the institution which lies at the very root and foundation of modern civil society.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS10">See, as to the <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"Frith-borh,"</FOREIGN> after, p. xxi.</NOTE1>  The difference between the Gild and the Peace-pledge was akin to that which lies between the old words <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"wed"</FOREIGN> and <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"borh"</FOREIGN>; as <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"wed"</FOREIGN> is that security which is given by a man personally, for himself as an individual, and <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"borh"</FOREIGN> the pledge given by a man for others, so a Gild was the association of men together for common objects of private and individual benefit, in which each man gave his <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"wed"</FOREIGN> to abide by their internal bye-laws, while a Frith-borh was the banding of men together, within the limits of a boundary, in which each joined in the <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"borh"</FOREIGN> or pledge for the keeping of the peace, and performance of public duties, by all the others.</P><P>"English Gilds, as a system of wide-spread practical institutions, are older than any Kings of England.  They are told of in the books that contain the oldest relics of English Laws.  The old laws of King Alfred, of King Ina, of King Athelstan, of King Henry I., reproduce still older laws in which the universal existence of Gilds is treated as a matter of well-known fact, and in which it is taken to be a matter of course that every one belonged to some Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS11">See, in the same sense, Kemble, <HI1 REND="i">Saxons in England</HI1>, i. 239.</NOTE1>  As population increased, Gilds multiplied; and thus, while the beginnings of the older Gilds are lost in the far dimness of time, and remain quite unknown, the beginnings<EPB/><PB N="xvi"/>of the later ones took place in methods and with accompanying forms that have been recorded."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS12"><HI1 REND="i">Old Crown House</HI1>, p. 28.  With regard to the opinion entertained by some writers upon Gilds, that their origin was derived from the sacrificial feasts of the ancient Teutonic nations (e.g. Dr. Wilda, <FOREIGN>Gildenwesen in Mittelalter</FOREIGN>, cap. 1, ò 1; Lappenberg, <HI1 REND="i">History of England under the Anglo-Saxon Kings</HI1> (Thorpe's translation), vol. ii. p. 350; Thorpe, <FOREIGN>Diplomatarium Anglicum</FOREIGN>, Preface, p. xvi.), my father remarked "that none of our Gilds ever were founded on such a basis."  And when a reference to early Roman history was suggested (according to a favourite idea of tracing many English institutions to an origin in the Roman law), he replied, "There is not the shadow of an analogy (misleading as even 'analogies' are) between the old Sabine curies and our English Gilds.  We trace ours back to the old Saxon times—and they borrow their name from these, but even from them they differ very widely, and belong to two classes, markedly distinct."—(<HI1 REND="i">Private Letter</HI1>, Nov. 4, 1867.)</NOTE1></P><P>The evidences of this general system of Gilds in the Old English [Anglo-Saxon] times are to be found not only in the laws but in the actual records of a few of the Gilds still remaining to us.  This branch of the subject requires more study and more space than can now be given to it, but it may be well to point out some of the principal passages where the characteristics of those Gilds are indicated.  These show that the principle of association for mutual help in the affairs of life—commonly but mistakenly supposed to be modern—is found, in name and in fact, in the English laws of nearly 1200 years ago; and that it existed in activity then, and continued a very living spirit in the land, through the changes of age and circumstance, long before the times of which we have the fuller records in the present volume.</P><P>Among the laws of Ina (A.D. 688-725) are two touching the liability of the brethren of a Gild in the case of slaying a thief.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS13">Thorpe's <HI1 REND="i">Anglo-Saxon Laws</HI1>, Ina, 16, 21.</NOTE1>Alfred (A.D. 871-901) still further recognizes the brotherly Gild spirit in his laws, as to manslaughter by a kinless man, and again, where a man who has no relatives is slain;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS14"><HI1 REND="i">Ibid.</HI1>  Alfred, 27, 28.</NOTE1> in the first instance the man has rendered himself liable for a sum of money, and the Gild helps him to bear the burthen, in the second the Gild has a claim upon part of that which is paid by the slayer.  The famous <EPB/><PB N="xvii"/><FOREIGN>"Judicia Civitatis Lundoniæ"</FOREIGN> of Athelstan's time (A.D. 924-940) contains ordinances for the keeping up of social duties in the Gilds, or Gild-ships as they are there called, of London, which seem also to be referred to in the preamble to that body of laws.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS15">Thorpe's <HI1 REND="i">Anglo-Saxon Laws</HI1>, Athelstan V, 2, 3; 8, clauses v, vi.</NOTE1>  One of these nearly foreshadows one of the most usual ordinances of the Gilds of 450 years later;—"And we have also ordained respecting every man who has given his 'wed' in our Gild-ships, if he should die, that each Gild-brother shall give a fine loaf for his soul, and sing a fifty [of psalms], or get it sung within 30 days."

And let each gild-brother have two sesters of malt, and each young man one sester, and a sceat of honey.  And let the mass-priest at each of our meetings sing two masses, one for living friends, the other for the departed; and each brother of common condition two psalters of psalms, one for the living and one for the dead.  And at the death of a brother each man six masses, or six psalters of psalms; and at a death, each man five pence. And at a houseburning, each man one penny.  And if any one neglect the day, for the first time three masses, for the second five, and at the third time let him have no favour, unless his neglect arose from sickness or his lord's need.  And if any one neglect his contribution at the proper day, let him pay twofold.  And if any one of this brotherhood misgreet another, let him make boot [amends] with thirty pence.

The early use of the word "gild-ship" implies this the more strongly.  Meanwhile, "gilde" did not lose its old sense, and we find the two meanings—"geld," a payment (with a secondary use, money), and "gild," a brotherhood—running side by side, down to much later times, the relics of the former of the two still existing in our modern "yield."</P><P>Whatever was the particular form and object of the ancient Gilds —and my father seems to have considered that therein some of them differed widely from those of later times—the principles which gave them life were the same, namely, those of mutual self-help <EPB/><PB N="xx"/>xx and a manly independence which could think of the rights of others.  Mr. Kemble seems to point to that difference when he says, of the Saxon brotherhoods, "these gylds, whether in their original nature religious, political, or merely social unions, rested upon another and solemn principle: they were sworn brotherhoods between man and man, established and fortified upon <FOREIGN LANG="OE">'að and wed,'</FOREIGN>oath and pledge; and in them we consequently recognize the germ of those sworn communes, <FOREIGN>communœ</FOREIGN> or <FOREIGN>communiœ</FOREIGN>, which in the times of the densest seignorial darkness offered a noble resistance to episcopal and baronial tyranny, and formed the nursing cradles of popular liberty."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS29"><HI1 REND="i">Saxons in England</HI1>, ii. 310.</NOTE1>  Now, my father has elsewhere fully explained the important meaning, in English history, of the <FOREIGN>"commune"</FOREIGN>or <FOREIGN>"communitas,"</FOREIGN> that it "is the corporate title and description of a place.  A city or borough is, in its corporate capacity, a 'communitas,' so is a county."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS30"><HI1 REND="i">Men and Names of Old Birmingham</HI1> (1864), p, 76, <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>; also, <HI1 REND="i">Parliamentary Remembrancer</HI1>, vol. ii. p. 3.</NOTE1>  Comparing with this the example (p. 201) where the word "comune" is the description of a gild as a corporate body, it would appear that when Glanville wrote (temp. Henry II.) of a "commune, in other words a gild," he must have intended a town whose corporation had set up a Gild,—probably a Gild-Merchant, as was the practice in a great number of towns at that period.  The passage runs thus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Item si quis nativus quiete per unum annum et unum diem in aliquâ villâ privilegiatâ manserit, ita quod in eorum communiam, scilicet gyldam, tanquam civis receptus fuerit, eo ipso a villenagio liberabitur;"</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS31"><P><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">De Legibus</FOREIGN>, lib. v. c. 5.  Illustrative of what is here said is the following extract from the "Custumal of Preston," the second article of which practically embodies Glanville's maxim:—</P><P>"1. So that they shall have a Gild-mercatory, with Hanse, and other customs and liberties belonging to such Gild; and so that no one who is not of that Gild shall make any merchandize in the said town, unless with the will of the burgesses.</P><P>"2. If any nativus [born bondman] dwell anywhere in the same town, and holds any land, and be in the forenamed Gild and Hanse, and pay lot and scot with the same burgesses for one year and one day, then he shall not be reclaimed by his lord, but shall remain free in the same town."—Dobson and Harland's <HI1 REND="i">History of Preston Guild</HI1>, and edition, p. 73.</P></NOTE1> <EPB/><PB N="xxi"/>and this view of Glanville's meaning is further borne out by the use of the terms <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"villa privilegiata,"</FOREIGN> which imply that it was so usual for such a town to have and be joined with a Gild, that he used the words as synonymous.</P><P>In further elucidation of this matter and of the growth of free local institutions in England, of which the true Gild or Brotherhood is one type, and the Borough another,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS32">"Shires we have, and Hundreds, and Cities, and Boroughs, and Parishes, and Corporations of other kinds.

The 'View of Frank-pledge,' which (though only nominal in many places, yet still quite real in others) is now kept up in Courts Leet, is one relic of this <FOREIGN LANG="OE">'Frith-borh.'</FOREIGN>  The liability of hundreds, parishes, &amp;c., to certain obligations, is another practical relic of it.  Every man, in every <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">'Communitas,'</FOREIGN> used to be obliged to be actually enrolled in the <FOREIGN LANG="OE">'Frith-borh'</FOREIGN> on reaching a certain age, and thenceforth had to be present (or to account for his absence) at every one of the regular meetings of the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">'Communitas.'</FOREIGN>This practice was kept up till comparatively modern times.  The 'Articles of the View of Frank-pledge' were part of the Common Law, but were also enacted in Acts of Parliament, and were added to from time to time, as fresh circumstances arose.</P><P>"The bodies thus acting were all true <HI1 REND="i">'Corporations,'</HI1> though, as different places increased and grew unequally, different shapes were taken, some larger and some smaller, and some almost dwindled <EPB/><PB N="xxii"/>away to nothing.  Representative Councils, &amp;c., are a mere incident and not an essential to Corporations.  The whole body is <HI1 REND="i">the Corporation</HI1>.  The head of these Corporations used to be the 'Provost' (a name formerly universal in England), the 'Constable,' the 'Bailiff,' or the 'Reeve.'  Up to the 'Corporations Reform Act' of William IV., the names of the heads of Corporations varied very much.  That of 'Mayor' is really modern.  It is but twenty-five years since the corporate (representative) body in Birmingham was the Bailiffs and Court Leet.</P><P>"The <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">'Communitas'</FOREIGN> has, at Common Law, and without any Statute, full power to regulate its own affairs, and to make 'Bye-laws' for its own governance, by the assent of its own members. This power is inherent, and necessary to enable it to fulfil its obligations to the State.</P><P>"Charters of Incorporation do not and cannot <HI1 REND="i">create</HI1> Corporations. They have always depended, and still depend, for even their validity upon the pre-existence of the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">'Communitas,'</FOREIGN> as above stated, and upon the assent and acceptance of the 'Charter' by the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">'Communitas.'</FOREIGN>  In this respect the Corporations Reform Act made no difference.  This matter became tested in the case of the Manchester Charter which was issued under that Act, and that Charter was held by the Courts of Law to be only sustainable upon proof of assent and acceptance.</P><P>"'Charters' therefore do not 'incorporate.'  They merely <HI1 REND="i">record</HI1>. They may (within the limits allowed by Common or Statute Law) declare the form or shape of certain municipal titles, offices, or functions within the Corporation; but they do not touch the inherent characteristics of it, or its responsibilities, or the essential element of assent and acceptance.</P><P>"As cities and built towns have a more compact municipal life and action than other places, the notion of Corporations (in the political sense) is apt to be exclusively attached to them.  But this is quite incorrect.  Every place where a Court Leet has been held, is or has been really a Corporation.  'Hundreds' are Corporations <EPB/><PB N="xxiii"/>(though now almost atrophied in most places); and the 'Hundreds' used, as such, to have corporate seals.  Counties also are Corporations. So also are Parishes, and the true 'Wards' of London. Each of all these has an independent life, and the power of selfaction, by its own consent, in matters that touch the common wellbeing; while, on the other hand, each is held bound to the State in certain definite and important <HI1 REND="i">Responsibilities</HI1>.  And these, conjointly, are the characteristics of a 'Corporation' in the political as distinguished from the commercial use of that title.

Of the second of these, held at Cambridge,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS41">"Cantebrigge;" this is sometimes wrongly translated "Canterbury."</NOTE1> and which fell in the 12th year of Richard II. (p. 136), it happens that the Roll or official record is now lost, but it is known from other remains that it sat thirty-nine days, and that even in that short time it passed "sixteen good acts,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS42">Prynne's <HI1 REND="I">Parliamentary Writs</HI1>, vol. iv. pp. 404, 405.</NOTE1>touching among other things the condition of labourers, and regulating beggars and common nuisances.  In this Parliament it was ordered that two Writs should be sent to every Sheriff in England, both commanding him to make public proclamation throughout the shire, the first calling upon "the Masters and Wardens of all Gilds and Brotherhoods," to send up to the King's Council in Chancery Returns of all details as to the foundation, statutes, and property of their Gilds (p. 127); the second calling on the "Masters and Wardens and Overlookers of all the Mysteries <EPB/><PB N="xxv"/>and Crafts," to send up, in the same way, copies of their charters or letters patent, where they had any (p. 130).  These Writs were sent out on the 1st of November, 1388, the Returns were ordered to be sent in before the 2nd of February next ensuing.  Those Returns thus made during the winter months, just 480 years ago, and forty years after the "great pestilence," by which some of them mark their dates,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS43">Bundle CCCVIII.

Many of them must be lost, as we know that there were Gilds in other places of which there is no Return left (pp. 272, 357).  But even thus reduced in number, there are still extant these official Returns of more than five hundred of the brotherhoods which once were scattered all over the land, enough to teach us the characteristics, purposes, and value of these institutions.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS44">See before, p. xiv.  The materials that exist for the further study of the history of Gilds in England are rich and various.  Not only among the Public Records, such as the Charter Rolls, the Patent Rolls (which contain much information), the Rolls of Parliament, and others, should the inquirer seek; but the local and municipal archives in numberless places would, there is little doubt, yield much valuable knowledge to an intelligent and careful search.  A great deal also may be learned indirectly, while at the same time the original authorities and sources are indicated by which their statements can be tested, from those interesting books, many of them monuments of labour and research, the Topographical Histories.  The old Chartularies of Abbeys, (p. 297), and the muniments of colleges (for example Winchester College; see <HI1 REND="I">Archœological Journal</HI1>, vol. ix. p. 69), may also give their contributions.  But in point of comprehensiveness, instruction, and variety, none of these will exceed the group of Records now, for the most part, first made known.</NOTE1></P><P>These Records themselves deserve a few words before passing on to their contents.  The Englishman's independence, and the diversity of character following thereupon, are features stamped upon them.  Written by men of the people, and not by legal officials, the handwritings are as various as would be expected to be found among the same number of different writers in every age,—some difficult to read, many clear and good.  The language used is not always the same, the greater part are in Latin; but a number are in the old French of the time, and still more preferred their mother <EPB/><PB N="xxvi"/>tongue.  The substance of the matters given, and the fulness with which the ordinances are set out, vary in a remarkable degree, in some cases only the barest facts being sent in on a small strip of parchment, while in others the fulness of detail covers several large skins.</P><P>It will be perhaps useful here to call attention to some of the principal features, gleaned from these Returns, of the old life of the Gilds who made them, the dates of whose foundations range, for the most part, from early in the thirteenth and throughout the fourteenth centuries.  A few, however, date from older times, as in the case of Beverley and others.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS45">See before, p. xxiii.</NOTE1></P><P>The fundamental idea of the Gild, as seen above, was, that it was an association for mutual help, made by the people themselves when and as they found the need for it.  Long ago my father wrote that "it is an essential characteristic of the system of local self-government, that its constant tendency is, to bring men together continually, with feelings of brotherhood; that it affords every opportunity for the manly asking and manly rendering of sympathy when individual misfortune entitles to it;"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS46"><HI1 REND="I">Local Self-Government and Centralization</HI1> (1851), p. 538.</NOTE1> and these words now tell the source whence the old Gild spirit drew its breath.  Though one Gild may have set itself one special object, and another a different one, yet, running throughout the whole, there are to be found the same general characteristics of brotherly aid and social charity; and the accompanying arrangements necessary to carry these out were things common to all, and therefore well understood as matters of course. If, therefore, we do not find recorded of every one that it kept a feast, or held a "morn-speech," or had a Gild-house, &amp;c., it must be taken to be because each of these was so usual a part of a Gild existence that it was not necessary to mention the fact.</P><P>Gilds may be divided into two broad classes (pp. 127, 130), the Social Gilds and the Gilds of Crafts, which, as has been seen, were recognized by the authority of Parliament, who issued a separate <EPB/><PB N="xxvii"/>Writ for the Returns from each. The Social Gilds were founded upon the wide basis of brotherly aid and moral comeliness, without distinction (unless expressly specified) of calling or class, and comprehended a great variety of objects; the Craft-Gilds, while sharing the same principles, were formed for the benefit of the members as craftsmen, and for the regulation of their craft.  The Joiners and Carpenters of Worcester (p. 208), the Fullers and the Ringers of Bristol (pp. 283, 288), and the Tailors, the Cordwainers, and the Bakers of Exeter (pp. 312, 331, 334) are examples of these.  There were also Gilds that were neither wholly Social nor of a Craft (p. 179), and to these it seems that Gilds-Merchant belonged, as, though we find them answering to the Writ for Crafts (in the case of Beverley, p. 150), yet their Ordinances, as in the instance of Coventry (pp. 228-232), of Berwick (p. 338), and of Southampton,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS47">See the early part of the 'Ancient Ordinances of the Gild-Merchant of the Town of Southampton,' printed by Mr. Smirke in the <HI1 REND="I">Archœological Journal</HI1>, vol. xvi. pp. 283, 343.  For a copy of this very interesting paper I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Albert Way.</NOTE1> often partook of the character of those of the Social Gild.  Sometimes it was begun by the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"communitas"</FOREIGN> of a town, as in the case of the Gild of the Holy Cross of Birmingham (pp. 239, 241), but generally the first founding of a Gild was by some "body of the folks" themselves, who might sometimes be traders, sometimes not.  For instance, there are the "Shephirdes Gild" of Holbech, the "Young Scholars" of Lynn (p. 51), the "Shipmanes Gild" of the same place (p. 54), the "Peltyers" and others of Norwich (p. 28), the "Poor Men" of Norwich (p. 40), the "Tailors" of Lincoln (p. 182), the "Gild of the Palmers" of Ludlow<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS48">I find from one note of my father's that there was a Gild at Burgh, Lincolnshire, founded by some Pilgrims in fulfilment of a vow made by them while tempesttossed at sea.  Bundle CCCX, 245.</NOTE1> (p. 193).  And it follows from this principle of free association that, as no wrong was done to any one and no public responsibilities of individuals interfered with (but rather the contrary), it is found that the "King's license was not necessary (as is wrongly alleged)"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS49">MS. note by T.

The terms of the Writs for the Returns show that this was well understood.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS51">See notes to pp. 128, 130; also p. 251.</NOTE1>  It seems probable that the mistake has arisen through two things: first, the custom of inserting their Gild into the Charter when the men of any town got their rights confirmed, as was seen among the Gilds-Merchant; and second, the need that there was for Gilds, like other corporate bodies, when they wished to acquire lands or tenements, to take out a License in Mortmain under the Statute of Mortmain.  Several instances of these licenses taken out by Gilds occur in the following pages.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS52">Pages 195, 226, 232, 243, 244, &amp;c.

But the Gilds were lay bodies, and existed for lay purposes, and the better to enable those who belonged to them rightly and understandingly to fulfil their neighbourly duties as free men in a free State.... It is quite true that, as the Lord Mayor, and Lincoln's Inn, and many other as well known personages and public bodies, have to this day a chaplain, so these old Gilds often took measures and made payments, <EPB/><PB N="xxix"/>to enable the rites of religion to be brought more certainly within the reach of all who belonged to them.  This was one of the most natural and becoming of the consequences following from their existence and character.  It did not make them into superstitious bodies."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS54"><HI1 REND="i">'Old Crown House,'</HI1> p. 31.</NOTE1>  Though it was in this way very general to provide more or less for religious purposes, these are to be regarded as incidental only; and this is curiously exemplified by the case of three Gilds in Cambridge, one of which excludes priests altogether (Gild of the Annunciation, p. 271), another, if they come into the Gild, does not allow them any part in its management (pp. 264, 265), while the third has a chaplain, but if their funds get too low both to maintain a chaplain and the poor brethren, the chaplain is to be stopped (p. 271).  These cases are however exceptional; and the evidences of a simple piety and of a faith that entered into the every-day life are some of the most pleasing traits of the old Gild-Ordinances.  It was not every Gild who could afford to support a chaplain, though some did so;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS55">See pp. 74, 144, 146, 165, 183, &amp;c.</NOTE1> but there were few who did not make some provision for services in their church, and for decent burial and burial-services for their members,—their care in this last respect going so far as to fetch the body from a distance if it so befell,—and appoint how the details, various of course in different cases, of the customary religious rites for the dead should be carried out.  The usual course was for many, or all, of the brethren to attend these services (at Norwich more prayer was expected of the "lettered" brethren than of the unlettered, at the dirge, p. 20); that wax lights should be provided at the cost of the Gild, and that each brother and sister should make an offering for alms and another for masses for the soul of the departed.  Sometimes the lights burning round the body of the dead were many in number, in one instance very elaborate funeral rites, with a hearse, are enjoined (pp. 169, 176, 215), in others, night-watches were kept under curious conditions (pp. 194, 217).  On these occasions, too, the poor were often fed or clothed "for the soul's sake of the dead" (pp. 31, 173, 180, &amp;c.).</P><EPB/><PB N="xxx"/><P>It was usual for all the brethren and sistren to go to church on the day of their general meetings, to hear mass and to make offerings.

Scarcely five out of the five hundred were not formed equally of men and of women, which, in these times of the discovery of the neglect of ages heaped upon woman, is a noteworthy fact.  Even where the affairs were managed by a company of priests, women were admitted as lay members;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS57">Gild of Corpus Christi, York, p. 141.  Women joined in the foundation of Gilds, and wives as well as single women belonged to them.  See pp. 155, 159, 160, 455.</NOTE1> and they had many of the same duties and claims upon the Gild as the men.  The sort of people who joined together may be somewhat judged of by the names given before;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS58">Page xxvii.</NOTE1> and Chaucer incidentally helps us to understand them by his description of the brethren who joined the Pilgrimage to Canterbury, and who, being all clothed in one livery, must have belonged to the same Gild:—<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L>"An Haberdasher and a Carpenter,</L><L>A Webbe, a Deyer, and a Tapiser,</L><L>Were all y-clothed in o livere</L><L>Of a solempne and grete fraternite.</L><L>Ful freshe and new hir gere ypicked was,</L><L>Hir knives were ychaped not with bras,</L><L>But all with silver wrought ful clene and wel,</L><L>Hir girdeles and hir pouches every del.</L><L>Wel semed eche of hem a fayre burgeis,</L><L>To sitten in a gild halle, on the deis.</L><L>Everich, for the wisdom that he can,</L><L>Was shapelich for to ben an alderman.</L><L>For catel hadden they ynough and rent</L><L>And eke hir wives wolde it well assent."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS59">Prologue to <HI1 REND="i">Canterbury Tales</HI1>.

Of the two lists of names in this volume (pp. 112, 453), while both show the number of sisters, the last is especially interesting because it points out the rank or calling of so many of the members, and that all classes were alike admitted. The number of members enrolled by St. George's Gild of Norwich was very great, as the numerous books and records still existing in that city bear witness, but they can hardly have exceeded the number of 14,850 attained by Corpus Christi, York (p. 142).  The Gild of the Trinity, Coventry, admitted many famous men, even, according to Dugdale, enrolling Kings Henry IV. and Henry VI. among its members,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS60">Warwickshire, i. 192.</NOTE1> while in later times the Gild of St. Barbara of St. Katharine's Church, near the Tower of London, could point out Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey as brethren.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS61">Strype's <HI1 REND="i">Stow</HI1>, book ii. p. 6.</NOTE1></P><P>Each member on admittance took an oath of obedience, and was received lovingly by the brethren, with a kiss of peace (pp. 6, 9, 189).  Two examples of the oath are here given, one belonging to a purely social Gild of Stamford (pp. 189, 191 <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>), the other to the Craft-Gild of the Tailors of Exeter (p. 318).  The oath taken by the brethren of the Gild of St. George at Norwich resembles that of Stamford; it is given by Blomefield in his History of Norfolk.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS62">Vol. ii. p. 734.</NOTE1>  A Gild did not invariably require an oath, as in that of Corpus Christi, York (p. 141); this was, however, an unusual case.</P><P>The payments that were made were numerous, and we find them, among the different Gilds, of an infinite variety.  Thus there was the payment on admittance, sometimes a fixed amount, sometimes "as the masters and he may accord" (p. 7), and in <EPB/><PB N="xxxii"/>different forms; sometimes in money, as in the Gild of St. Benedict, Lincoln, six shillings and eightpence (p. 174), and in St. George's Gild, Norwich, six shillings and eightpence for a man, three shillings and fourpence for a woman (p. 450); sometimes in kind, as in the case of Stretham, Ely, where every incomer was to pay two pounds of wax and one bushel of barley.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS63">Bundle CCCIX. No. 49.</NOTE1>  Besides this entrance fee, there were the house fees, or "rights of the house," which were payments to the officers, such as "to the Alderman 1<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>, to the Dean 1<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>, and to the wax 1/2<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>" (pp. 54, 108, &amp;c.); there were payments "to the light," for the feast, on the death of a brother or sister, on occasions when help was needed for a poor brother or one in distress, and others, all which were part of the usual regulations.  As various, too, were the arrangements of times of payment, in one Gild so much a year would be agreed upon (p. 4), in another so much a quarter (pp. 7, 10), as the contribution from each to the common fund, and in that of Corpus Christi, Hull, five farthings was to be paid weekly by every member (p. 160). Nor were the people careless, though unsparing, of their monies; we find frequent mention of "the common box" (p. 10), "common pyx,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS64">Bundle CCCVIII. Nos. 58, 126.</NOTE1> or chest (p. 139), and the stewards, aldermen, or other officers, were required annually to render true accounts of the "catel" and funds of the Gild.  In some Gilds it was an understood thing, if not an ordinance, that a brother or sister dying should leave it a legacy, for example, the Peltyers of Norwich had no lands, but were partly supported by legacies (pp. 29, 165, 170, 317, 319).</P><P>Every Gild had its appointed day or days of meeting, once a year (pp. 19, 23), twice (pp, 113, 117), three times (p. 58), or four times (pp. 65, 91), as the case might be, when all the brethren and sistren, summoned by the Dean or other officer,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS65">The "common bellman" went through the city in Norwich and Spalding.  See after, p. 31; and Bundle CCCIX. No. 197.</NOTE1> met together to transact their common affairs.  At these meetings, called morn-speeches (in the various forms of the word), or "dayes of spekyngges tokedere for here comune profyte" (p. 67), much business was done, <EPB/><PB N="xxxiii"/>such as the choice of officers, admittance of new brethren, making up accounts, reading over the ordinances, &amp;c., one day, where several were held in the year, being fixed as the "general day."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS66">See, for example, the cases of the Gild of St. Thomas of Canterbury, Lynn, pp. 80, 81, and of the Gild Merchant of Coventry, p. 229.  See also p. 128, <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>.</NOTE1></P><P>The word morning-speech <FOREIGN LANG="OE">(morgen-spœc)</FOREIGN> is as old as Anglo-Saxon times, <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"morgen"</FOREIGN> signified both "morning" and "morrow,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS67">See Mr. Way's note (3) to p. 344 of his edition of the Promptorium.</NOTE1>and the origin of the term would seem to be that the meeting was held either in the morning of the same day or on the morning (the morrow) of the day after that on which the Gild held its feast and accompanying ceremonies, and that it afterwards became applied to other similar meetings of the Gild-brethren.  The practice in several places, though all were not alike, bears out this explanation (p. 7; compare pp. 10 and 11; 30, 40, 80, 97, 176, &amp;c.)  One day at least in the year, usually the day of the saint to which the Gild, if it had a saint's name, was dedicated, was more specially devoted than the others to festivities; by some it was called the "Gild-day" or "general" day (pp. 21, 30, 217, &amp;c.), it was then that the brethren and sistren being all assembled, at whatever hour was fixed (prime or otherwise),<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS68">See pp. 18, 31, 60, 79.  The brethren and sistren of the Gild of Holy Trinity, Lynn, were to meet at the place of feasting before going to church, "at what hour shall be declared to them by the sound of the trumpet."  Bundle CCCX. No. 38.</NOTE1> worshipped together, gave their alms, and feasted together, for "the nourishing of brotherly love."  On this day it was that the brethren and sistren, clad in their hoods or their livery, assembled at the church, bearing the lights which formed a universal part of the religious rites, there to make the prayers enjoined by their rules (pp. 23, 111, 114), and to consecrate by the acts of faith that brotherly love and peace which they were sworn to cherish; they made their offerings and went their way, perhaps to a morn-speech for settling some business, or if this were not the custom, they met in good fellowship at the Gild-house,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS69">Occasionally the feast was held at the houses of the brethren by turns, "in uno certo loco ad aliquem domum fratrum vel sororum." Caistor.  Bundle CCCX. No. 193.</NOTE1> round the social board.  At some of these <EPB/><PB N="xxxiv"/>feasts prayers were again offered up (p. 76, 217), and the peaceable and good behaviour of all was constantly and strictly enjoined. Some Gilds would allow a guest to be brought (pp. 185 <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>, 219). In one case the brethren improved the time by having their ordinances read over to them while at dinner (p. 176).</P><P>The Gild brethren were fond on their feast-days of rejoicing in various processions, in which numerous lights, music, and sometimes flowers and garlands of leaves were used (pp. 30, 38, 117, &amp;c.), and symbolic shows had a part (pp. 30, 149, 232).  The Gild of the Lord's Prayer at York was expressly set up for the purpose of providing that "a play setting forth the goodness of the Lord's Prayer" should be kept up and played periodically in the streets of York.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS70">See p. 137.  It will be seen that the founders did not confine themselves to this object only, and their ordinances present "an excellent example of the general purposes of Gilds."  MS. note, T. S.</NOTE1>  The day of the procession or "riding" of the famous show of St. George's Gild in Norwich (pp. 444 <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>, 446) must have been a grand one for the sight-seers of the city; while the streets of Leicester,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS71">Thompson's <HI1 REND="i">History of Leicester</HI1>, pp. 149-151.</NOTE1> York (pp. 142, 143), Coventry, Preston, Worcester (p. 407), and many more, must have witnessed a goodly sight when the shows belonging to individual Gilds, or when the pageants of Gilds and crafts combined, were displayed in gorgeous array along them.  In the present day, when the race of life is to the swift, and there is scarcely time left for anything else, these popular pageants are despised, and a barren imagination can see in the last relic of them, the Lord Mayor's Show, nothing but "a bore." But it was not so in former times, and the real value of the large share that the old Gilds had in making England "Merry" is well pointed out in the following lines:—"Each Gild's first steps were bent towards their church, where solemn high mass was chanted; thence went all the brotherhood to their hall for the festive dinner. The processions on the occasion and other amusements so dear to Englishmen, when their country was merry England, were meant <EPB/><PB N="xxxv"/>to be edifying and instructive; and helped religion to make her children both good and happy, through even their recreations. This present age, with its stepmother's chill heart, dull eye, and hard iron-like feelings, that sees naught but idleness in a few hour's harmless pause from toil, and knows nothing but unthriftiness in money spent in pious ceremonial, and thinks that the God who sprinkled the blue heaven with silvery stars, and strewed the green earth with sweet-breathing flowers of a thousand hues, and taught the birds to make every grove ring with their blithe songs, and told the little brook to run forth with a gladsome ripple, all in worship of Himself, can be best and most honoured by the highest and noblest of His wonderful works,—the soul of man,—the more gloomy, the more mopish, the sourer it is; such an age will not understand the good which, in a moral and social point of view, was bestowed upon this country by the religious pageants, and pious plays and interludes of a by-gone epoch. Through such means, however, not only were the working-classes furnished with a needful relaxation, but their very merry-making instructed while they diverted them."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS72">Canon Rock's <HI1 REND="i">Church of our Fathers</HI1>, vol. ii. p. 418.  The same volume also contains much curious and valuable information as to old English Gilds, pp. 395-453</NOTE1></P><P>The form that the property of a Gild took depended on as different circumstances as the amounts were various.  Some were endowed with land at their foundation, or had gifts of land or tenements made to them, as the Gilds of Coventry, Holy Cross of Birmingham (pp. 231, 240), and of St. John the Baptist, Deritend.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS73"><HI1 REND="i">Old Crown House</HI1>, p. 34.</NOTE1>  Of many it seems to have merely consisted of the contributions in money or in kind, expended and accounted for by responsible officers; others acquired considerable property in church ornaments, furniture for the Gild-house, goods used in the plays and shows, &amp;c., as may be seen from many curious inventories still existing (pp. 233, 320, 327).  Some Gilds invested in cows or oxen, and let them out at so much a year.  We are told that the <EPB/><PB N="xxxvi"/>Wardens of the Gild of our Lady, Byom (Derbyshire), <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"ont achatez boefs et les ont seueralment lowez as diuerse persones pur ijs. par an.;"</FOREIGN> and they make return of their property, besides land, in 20 beeves.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS74">Bundle CCCVIII.

No. 71.  See also after, p. 192.</NOTE1></P><P>The practical mutual charity of the Gild-spirit is truly seen in the way in which they disposed of their monies.  Care for the fitting burial of dead brethren and sistren, at the cost of the Gild, was constantly taken; help to the poor, the sick, the infirm, and aged, to those who had suffered by losses or robbery, and to those overtaken by misfortune, if this were not through their own folly or misconduct, is not less prominent a feature in the Ordinances. The weekly payments to the poor are frequently specified, as well as gifts of clothing or food.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS75">See especially pp. 148, 169, 231.</NOTE1>  Sometimes, too, they were to be visited, at other times entertained, at the houses of their richer brethren. In some cases, loans of money from the Gild-stock were made upon surety being given (pp. 8, 11); in others free loans or gifts were made to enable the young of either sex to get work or to trade (pp. 9, 156, 229); while in Ludlow, "any good girl of the Gild" had an unconditional dowry given her, if her father were too poor to provide it (pp. 194, 340).  Brethren cast into prison were to be visited and helped to get free (pp. 50, 169, 193).  Those who were going on a pilgrimage, whether to the Holy Land, St. James of Compostella, or to Rome, were helped and honoured (pp. 157, 172, 177); one Gild even yearly sending a pilgrim to Canterbury.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS76">Bundle CCCX. No. 49.</NOTE1>  The Gild-Merchant of Coventry kept a "lodging house with thirteen beds, to lodge poor folks coming through the land on pilgrimage or any other work of charity," with a governor of the house and a woman to wash the pilgrims' feet (p. 231).</P><P>Of the good works done by the Gilds other than among their own personal members, many instances may be found.  It was <EPB/><PB N="xxxvii"/>not unfrequent for a number of poor to be fed on the feast-day at the Gild-hall; thus in two of the Lincoln gilds it was ordered that as many poor as there were brothers and sisters were to be fed with bread, ale, and fish; and in the Gild of Gertonburdych, Norfolk, provision was made for the distribution of a certain amount of corn and barley yearly.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS77">Bundle CCCVIII.

Turning from the poor to works of public usefulness, we find that these same two Gilds charged themselves with the repairs of certain highways (pp. 249, 256); the Gild of Hatfield Brodoke, Essex, also contributed to the repair of roads;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS78">Bundle CCCVIII. No. 59.</NOTE1>while the Gild of St. Nicholas, Worcester, repaired the walls and bridge of that city (p. 205).  Many Gilds made important contributions to the repair of churches, of which that of Pampesworth, Cambridgeshire, is a curious example: some bushels of barley were given "to put out to increase, for the use and repair of the church in the said town, which is in poor condition and partly decayed; and as of necessity in a short time the top [<HI1 REND="i">tort</HI1>] of this, called the 'Roof,' must be made anew, and it cannot be done without the aid of the Gild, they pray for God that their goods be not disturbed."  The Gild of Swafham Bulbek (Cambridgeshire) undertook the "repair of the church, and renovation of vestments, books, and other ornaments in the said church."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS79">Bundle CCCIX.

And among the good works which the elastic constitution of the Gilds rendered it natural and fitting for them to take up, was the maintenance <EPB/><PB N="xxxviii"/> of a free school and schoolmaster, as was done by the Gild of St. Nicholas in Worcester (pp. 203-205), the Gild of Palmers in Ludlow (p. 198), and the famous Gild of Kalenders in Bristol (p. 288).</P><P>The government of the Gild, its Officers, and its Ordinances or Bye-laws, were based on the same principles as those of the other free institutions of England.  The Gild had usually its head officer or Alderman (Graceman); its Stewards (Wardens), into whose hands the property or funds were entrusted for administration; its Dean or Beadle; and its Clerk (pp. 46, 176).  These were all chosen annually, frequently by a secondary election (pp. 71, 97, 266), and had to render an annual account; every one who refused to serve had to pay a fine; the Dean and the Clerk were paid yearly salaries, and all the officers had special allowances on feast days (pp. 66, 88).  Other officers were chosen when the need for them arose (pp. 156, 160, 217).  At Lancaster a committee of twelve was appointed to manage the affairs of the Gild, together with collectors (p. 164).  The custom of making their own Ordinances—like the "Usages" of a Corporation, the "Customary" of a Manor (for example, Tettenhall and Bushey, pp. 432, 441), or the "Bye-laws" of a Parish<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS80">See Toulmin Smith's <HI1 REND="i">The Parish</HI1>, pp. 47-51.</NOTE1>—is but another illustration of the old common law of England, by which, while abiding by the law of the land, men shaped for themselves the rules that should guide them in their own community (see p. 348).  The Ordinances were frequently read over, so that none might plead ignorance (pp. 159, 162, 178, 315); and if alteration was made it was done with the assent of all the brethren and sistren (pp. 8, 11).  This assent was also necessary to business transactions (pp. 246, 271).  The Gilds had in their corporate capacity a common seal, of which two examples are figured.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS81">Pp. 207, 250.  See also pp. 146, 168, 327.</NOTE1></P><P>The Livery Companies of London are often spoken of, as though the "livery" were something peculiar to them.  This is, however, only the relic of a past custom by which every Gild, as is seen in <EPB/><PB N="xxxix"/>these Returns, had its livery of one suit, whether hoods or gowns or both, for sistren and for brethren, ordinances being often made as to the length of time and the occasions when they were expected to be worn (pp. 43, 56, 446, &amp;c.).  The giving of these liveries by Gilds and other bodies was attempted to be stopped by Parliament about a year after the Returns were made, but apparently with little effect.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS82">Rolls of Parliament, 13 Rich. II., Petition 29.</NOTE1>  That the livery became an outward sign of the social importance of the Gilds and brotherhoods was recognized in Parliament a few years later, when the use of certain liveries of cloth were forbidden,—"Gilds and fraternities, and crafts in the cities and boroughs within the kingdom, which are founded and ordained to good intent and purpose, alone being excepted."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS83">Rolls of Parliament, 13 Hen.

Corner (1865), pp. 8-16.  See after, pp. 422, 423.</NOTE1></P><P>Two very striking characteristics, the second one universally expressed among all the bye-laws of all the Gilds, must not pass unnoticed.  The first is the respect for law and its established forms; the second, the constant sense of moral worth, and the endeavour to attain it.  "No ordinances shall be made against the common law" (pp. 23, 30, 39); "rebels against the laws shall be put out of the Gild" (pp. 50, 52); "the liberties of the town shall be upheld" (pp. 167, 337): such was the sort of language used by those who governed themselves.  And when we consider the fact of this multitude of independent bodies of plain men and women, scattered all over the land, each bound by ordinances for the attainment of better demeanour and morality among themselves, who shall say what England does not owe at the present day to their efforts, and what might not be still further done by reviving their example now?  Every one who wished to be admitted into a Gild was required to be of good reputation and bearing; if a brother became a brawler or a thief, or committed other offences, he was punished <EPB/><PB N="xl"/>or turned out of the Gild.  Among the Ordinances of the Gild of St. Anne, in the church of St. Lawrence, Jewry, London, were the following:—"If any of the company be of wicked fame of his body, and take other wives than his own, or if he be single man, and be hold a common lechour or contekour, or rebel of his tongue, he shall be warned of the Warden three times; and if he will not himself amend, he shall pay to the Wardens all his arrearages that he oweth to the company, and he shall be put off for evermore.  And if ony man be of good state, and use hym to ly long in bed; and at rising of his bed ne will not work, but [? ne] wyn his sustenance and keep his house, and go to the tavern, to the wyne, to the ale, to wrastling, to schetyng, and in this manner falleth poor, and left his cattel in his defaut for succour; and trust to be holpen by the fraternity: that man shal never have good, ne help of companie, neither in his lyfe, ne at his dethe; but he shal be put off for evermore of the companie."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS84">Quoted in Strype's <HI1 REND="i">Stow</HI1>, bk. iii. p. 48.</NOTE1>  One brother was not allowed to belie or wrong another; if he did he was fined by the Gild (pp. 55, 81, 95).  Unruly speech or behaviour at the morn-speeches or towards the Alderman was forbidden, and peaceable, civil conduct at the feasts was strictly enjoined.  In the way of arbitration, it was made a part of the duty of either the brethren and sistren themselves, or of their officers, that if any dispute should arise between one brother and another, they should do all they could to "bring them at one," to settle the quarrel; and not until this was tried might the disputants go to law.  Fines were imposed upon any of the brethren who should take action against another without first submitting the quarrel to this "Council of conciliation;" and the officers of the Gild were also bound under penalties to use their best skill to make the peace (pp. 21, 96, 183, 450, 451).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS85">See the pages under "Arbitration" in the Index.

One thing comes out clearly; that though a Gild might be founded to carry out some special object, as often was the case,—as for the support of a church, the maintenance of an altar, or a play, the ringing of bells (pp. 288, 294), the keeping up of Records (p. 287), or of minstrelsy (p. 294), or for the encouragement of crafts and trade,—the same general features and the same ideas were common to all, but that these became modified or added to, according to the special need of the Gild.</P><P>A part of the subject, of an historical value, which cannot be further gone into here, and one for the study of which this volume furnishes much material, is the relation and connection of Gilds with the Corporate bodies of towns.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS86">Several notes bearing on this subject are on pp. 126, 239, 250, &amp;c.  See also, as showing the connection between the Gild and the town, the Ordinances of Southhampton before referred to (p. xxvii. note).</NOTE1>  The authorities and opinions on this point are numerous and conflicting; my father intended that the glance at the part taken<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS87">See pp. 357, 411, 430.</NOTE1> by Gilds in the cities whose Records are given in Part III., the contrast even between their bye-laws and those of the municipal bodies, together with the fuller accounts of others, such as the Gild of Holy Cross, Birmingham, the Gilds of Exeter, of Berwick, and of Coventry, should be made to elucidate this matter.  To this also London, with her numerous Social Gilds and Craft-Gilds, would have brought her testimony and swelled the illustration.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS88">Among the Returns, there are several from London Social Gilds, three important examples of which are now printed.  Stow, in his <HI1 REND="i">Survey of London</HI1>, gives the Ordinances of some others of later date, as well as of some of those of which the Returns remain (Bk. ii. p. 75; Bk. iii. pp. 34, 48, 62, 118, 148).  Of three of the ancient Craft-Gilds of London, the Esterlings, the Sadlers, and the Weavers, curious particulars may be found in Herbert's <HI1 REND="i">Livery Companies</HI1>, vol. i. pp. 10-17; Madox, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, p. 26; and the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Liber Custumarum</FOREIGN> of London (edition pub. by Master of the Rolls), Part i. p. 416.

But in case of Gilds (<HI1 REND="i">much wider</HI1>) no pretence of inquiry, or of mischief.  And no allowance whatever.

VIII. c. 4) the possessions of certain fraternities, brotherhoods, and gilds, that had been dissolved with the colleges and chantries, were vested in the Crown; and that the King was empowered to send out Commissioners to seize the possessions of others, under the plea that they should be "used and exercised to more godly and virtuous purposes," the Commissioners being directed to return Certificates "in writing of their doings in the same" into the Court of Chancery (§ 6).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS91">It was under these two sections that the "Certificates of Colleges," sometimes employed in this volume (see Index), were put on record.  See ò 12, on next page.</NOTE1>  The Act of I Edw. VI. c. 14 went further than this: after completing the demolition of colleges, free chapels, and chantries, it proceeded not only separately by name to vest in the King all sums of money devoted "by any manner of corporations, gilds, fraternities, companies or fellowships, or mysteries or crafts," to the support of a priest, obits, or lights, [which might be taken under colour of religion,] but to hand over to the Crown "all fraternities, brotherhoods, and gilds, being within the realm of England and Wales and other the King's dominions, and all manors, lands, tenements, and other hereditaments belonging to them or any <EPB/><PB N="xliii"/>of them, <HI1 REND="i">other</HI1> than such corporations, gilds, fraternities, companies, and fellowships of mysteries or crafts, and the manors, lands, tenements, and other hereditaments pertaining to the said corporations, gilds, fraternities, companies, and fellowships of mysteries or crafts, above mentioned" (§§ 6, 7).  Power was given to send out Commissioners to survey all "lay corporations, gilds, fraternities, companies, and fellowships of mysteries or crafts incorporate," and to assign and appoint, in specified ways, the disposition of their lands and property.  These Commissioners also were bound "to make Certificate under their seals, or the seals of two of them, at the least, into the Court of Augmentations and Revenues of the King's Crown, or into any other Court as is aforesaid, within one year next after the Commission to them directed, of all manors, lands, tenements, rents, tythes, portions," &amp;c. so assigned by them (§ 12).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS92">See previous note.</NOTE1>And all the lands, &amp;c. seized under this Act were to be "in the order, survey, and governance of the King's Court of the Augmentations and Revenues of his Crown" (§ 19).  My father says of these two acts in another place,—"The Act of 37 Hen. VIII. c. 4, passed in 1545, put this wanton and wicked pillage of public property as necessary 'for the maintenance of these present wars;' but it also cleverly put into one group 'colleges, free-chappelles, chauntries, hospitalles, fraternities, brotherhedds, [and] guyldes.' The Act of 1 Edw. VI. c. 14, was still more ingenious; for it held up the dogma of purgatory to abhorrence, and began to hint at Grammar Schools.  The object of both Acts was the same.  All the possessions of all Gilds, except what could creep out as being trading Gilds (which saved the London Gilds), became vested, by these two Acts, in the Crown; and the unprincipled courtiers who had devised and helped the scheme, gorged themselves out of this wholesale plunder of what was, in every sense, public property."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS93"><HI1 REND="i">Old Crown House,</HI1> p. 36.

Of these membranes, the greater part are vellum and parchment.  My father, however, made the interesting discovery that some of them are Paper of a very peculiar kind, hitherto unknown. <NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS95">To the description of this Paper given by my father, on pp. 44, 132, I add the following extracts from a letter published by him in the <HI1 REND="i">Birmingham Daily Post</HI1> of March 2, 1865.  "The introduction of specimens of linen paper into England, is known to have happened in 1342, possibly earlier.  Some letters from abroad during that early time are written on linen paper; and there is a Register-book which belonged to the Black Prince, which is of linen paper.  [See "þe papir," mentioned on p. 5.]  But the few instances thus known, are considered to have been the importation from abroad of a special rarity, which only came, and that not often, into the hands of the wealthy.  The manufacture of paper in England has been supposed to go no farther back than Elizabeth's time; but earlier entries have proved that there was at least one paper-mill in England as early as Henry VII.  Neither the official use nor the manufacture of paper, so early as 1388, has hitherto been suspected.  I have now proved the former to be a certain fact, and the latter becomes a probable one . . . [After describing the Writs to the Sheriffs (pp. 127, 130), and the instructions therein]—I find several of these instructions still existing, written upon paper; and I find that, in several cases, where the answer of the Sheriff was on a separate sheet, the latter is also paper, though of a different quality, sometimes, from that on which the instructions received by him were written.  None of the ways in which the existence of paper can be accounted for, as before said, in previously known instances of the use of linen paper, can explain the use of paper in this case.  It becomes proved that linen paper was used in public offices in London, and also used by some of the country gentlemen, who then were Sheriffs of distant shires, at the end of the fourteenth century.  It is difficult to believe that it can have been thus used unless it were made in England . . . Paper of later times loses its sizing after some century or two, and becomes soft and rotten.  But this paper, after nearly 500 years of very bad treatment, which has caused the decay of many parts, even of the vellum documents among which it is found, remains as firm, tough, and sound, as the best specimens of vellum that remain uninjured among it.  No such paper is now made."</NOTE1>  The documents have a great variety of shapes and sizes, from the strip three or four inches wide and twelve or fourteen inches long, and the nearly square piece eight or nine inches wide, to the lengthy writing, which fills a large sheet, or two, three, or four skins tacked together, edge to edge.  A few are written and stitched up in the form of small books (pp. 40, 44, 262). <EPB/><PB N="xlv"/>These Records were said, in 1842, to "require repair," and indeed, such has been their unheeded and forgotten condition, that, when my father first had them out, many of them had to be flattened, stamped, and prepared for his use.  Dirty, eaten away by rats and decay, many of them partially illegible (though many still remained in good condition), these Records presented the appearance of having, till quite recently, lain unheeded and unread for centuries past; and, except in one instance,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS96">In a paper communicated to the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological Society by Messrs.  J. L'Estrange and Walter Rye (who obligingly called my father's attention to it), eight of the Returns from Norwich Gilds were printed, of which all but two very short ones are included in this volume.  Mr. Rye was good enough to send me a copy of this paper, but I believe the Returns in this volume were all copied and in type before my father heard of it.</NOTE1> my father was not aware that any have ever before been printed, though, to one or two authors their existence may have been known.  In <HI1 REND="i">Memoirs illustrative of the History and Antiquities of Norfolk</HI1>, published in 1854, allusion is made to the "Returns made into Chancery, in the twelfth year of Richard II.'s reign, of the original objects, endowments, and extent of Gilds generally" (p. 142).  But when Herbert wrote his <HI1 REND="i">History of the Livery Companies of London</HI1>, (1837), the existence of these Records was quite unknown, for, after citing the Writ to the Sheriffs of London, given on p. 127, from a copy which must have been preserved among the City Records, he says,—"the Tower Records [of which these Returns form a part], as well as those of the City, have been diligently searched for the Returns made in consequence of this proclamation, <HI1 REND="i">but none are to be found</HI1>, except those which relate to the Ecclesiastical Gilds."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS97">Vol. i. p. 36.</NOTE1>  In Strype's edition of Stow (1720), though reference is made to the inquiry as to Gilds in the time of Richard II., and an instance is narrated in which (apparently) the Wardens of a Gild came before the Chancery personally, to deliver their Return,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS98">Bk. iii. pp. 48, 145.</NOTE1> this knowledge was probably gained, like Herbert's, from Records remaining in the City, no reference being made to those of the Tower.</P><EPB/><PB N="xlvi"/><P>The language and the writing of these Records have been noticed before (p. xxv.; of the writing, a remarkable specimen is described in a note to p. 175).</P><P>Of the Returns thus existing in the Public Record Office, this volume contains the whole of those that are written in English, to the number of forty-nine.  Translations and abstracts are given of some of those that are in Latin and French, and references are made to many more.  The number of documents is, however, so great that my father found it impossible to use even all the extracts he had intended for this work, and many of interest remain unnoticed. The Public Record Office has also afforded other contributions to the history of the Gilds (p. 126), among which are the "Certificates of Colleges" (pp. 197, 247, &amp;c.), and other records.</P><P>Other sources whence original MSS. have been derived, as the Libraries of Oxford and Cambridge, the British Museum, Municipal Archives, and private stores, are each acknowledged, and pointed out in the places where they occur, together with descriptions of the originals, in the notes appended to each.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS99"><P>The Roll of Winchester "Usages" demands a few words here.

Mr. Gunner among the muniments of Winchester College, which is in fact another version of these "Usages."  The age of this French MS. does not seem to be known with certainty, but it seems to be of nearly the same date as the English one.

For myself, I must be permitted to express my grateful sense of the kindness and courtesy which I have met with from my father's correspondents and friends (particularly those whose MSS. and books were left in the care of one unknown to them), and other gentlemen, well known for their literary and antiquarian learning, with whom I have had communication.  Without their assistance, freely given, what has been to me, though a labour of love, yet a somewhat difficult task, could not have been accomplished, and to all of them I beg to offer my best thanks.  Conscious of the imperfections and omissions that must necessarily occur in my part of the work, I yet may join in my father's often expressed desire, that it should be "useful to the people," and to that hope I dedicate the book, with the knowledge that some at least will believe, "She hath done what she could."</P><CLOSER><SIGNED>LUCY TOULMIN SMITH.</SIGNED><DATELINE>HIGHGATE, LONDON,<LB/>December, 1869.</DATELINE><LB/> [NOTE.—The original Gild Returns in the Public Record Office having been entirely re arranged, the three "Bundles" referred to in this volume no longer exist, and new references are required.

But after a few weeks' inquiry, I was convinced that a thorough knowledge of the position of the English working-class would require a sojourn of months in their country.  I therefore resolved to remain longer in England.  Working-men's Associations of every kind, and the History of Labour in England, became the chief objects of my study.  At last, in May 1869, I left England, with my portfolio full of the materials I had collected.  But I had scarcely returned home, when I was asked by Mr. Furnivall to write a General Introduction to Mr. Toulmin Smith's work on English Gilds, which he had left unfinished at his death.  As I unfortunately had not had the honour of knowing Mr. Smith personally, and therefore knew nothing of his ideas as to Gilds, I at first hesitated to accede to Mr. Furnivall's request.  My scruples increased when I considered that I was to undertake a work which ought to have been done by a man of great learning and repute.  And, indeed, now that my work is finished, I am so fully alive to its many deficiencies, that I greatly fear my undertaking this work will be thought by many, too daring.  But I hope the fairness of the reader will not let him measure my essay by his conception of what such an outline as the present ought to be.  I can only say that for many years past I have been deeply interested in this subject, that what I offer here to the reader is the result of much hard work and of many laborious personal researches in Libraries and Record-Offices, and that I have put forth my results in the best way I could, seeing the short time allowed me to write this essay in.</P><EPB/><PB N="liv"/><P>The reason why I finally resolved to comply with Mr. Furnivall's request, notwithstanding my hesitation, was, that I owe great thanks to my English friends who had drawn his attention to me.  I had learnt so much from them during my stay in England, that when an occasion presented itself to repay them in some way by a work which might be of use to them, I felt obliged to disregard any personal considerations.  On acceding to Mr. Furnivall's desire, I observed however, that I must write my essay quite independently, without consideration as to what Mr. Toulmin Smith would have said in his Introduction. He would probably have dwelt more fully on English Gilds only, and would have brought forward more direct information as to them than I should be able to do.  I, on the contrary, was requested by Mr. Furnivall to treat on Continental Gilds as well as English.  And I complied with his request with the more pleasure, as I believed that illustrations from the Continent might often help students to understand the development of English Gilds, where clear and direct accounts of them are wanting.  Often, indeed, the Gilds on the Continent differed in development and circumstances from those in England, as I have repeatedly pointed out in this essay.  But I strongly believe that the continual intercourse between the towns of the several trading countries of the Middle Ages, kept up especially by the Hanse Towns, may not have been without influence in producing a general similarity of development of burgensic life in them all.</P><P>What I offer to the reader in the following pages is by no means a history of Gilds, complete and exhaustive.  My desire has been simply to give a clear idea as to what the various kinds of Gilds were, and to sketch in free outlines how each kind of Gilds originated, grew powerful, and degenerated; on which the Gilds of another class of citizens took their place.  I have always taken special care to point out the analogies between the old Gilds and those existing in our days among working-men, the Trade-Unions; and I shall indeed consider it the greatest reward for all my labour spent on this work, if it contributes to set the Trade-Unions in a truer light.</P><P>Throughout the whole essay I have most conscientiously referred <EPB/><PB N="lv"/>to the sources of my statements, and to the various authors to whom I am indebted.  I am very sorry that, when writing the essay, I was not acquainted with the works of Mr. Toulmin Smith quoted by Miss Smith in her excellent Introduction.</P><P>Before concluding, I wish to express my sincere thanks to all those who have helped me in my work, especially to Mr. Furnivall.  He has with great zeal and kindness revised the translation of my essay and the proofs; and has besides added, from early English literature, a few notes in illustration of my text.  He also procured from Professor Stubbs the communication as to bondmen in towns, in the Additional Note 3; and has drawn my attention to a few points which wanted further explanation for the English reader.  I have made some additional notes on these points, which follow the Preface, namely, as to the origin of Gilds, as to my appellation <HI1 REND="i">Religious Gilds</HI1>, and as to the companies of bond-handicraftsmen.  I wish to thank, besides, especially Mr. J. W. van Rees Hoets, M.A., of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and the other friends of Mr. Furnivall and myself who have helped in the translation of parts of this essay.  It was hard work that they performed, and they did it well.</P><CLOSER><SIGNED>L. BRENTANO.</SIGNED><DATELINE>ASCHAFFENBURG.

FURNIVALL asks me to make much more emphatic my statement as to England's being the birthplace of Gilds.  He thinks besides, that my derivation of the Gilds from the family, contradicts the supposition of the origin of Gilds in England.  He writes accordingly to me:— "I certainly suppose your Part I. to mean that the Gilds were developed well in early times—indeed, on the Continent—and brought over here with the Anglo-Saxon settlers.  You do not say so in exact words; but your terms as to family-life, and neighbours meeting at sacrificial feasts, imply an earlier stage of civilization, more of a growth in Saxon wilds, than the (more or less) organized bodies of immigrants here were in, or had."</P><P>Now, I wish to declare here most emphatically that I consider England the birthplace of Gilds.  But, at the same time, I wish to deny quite as emphatically, that what I have said on p. lxix as to the family, implies a stage of civilization before the immigration of the Anglo-Saxons.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS100"><L>"But þe Saxons acorded for no þynge</L><L>Þat þe Anglys schuld be þer kyng;</L><L>Þey hadde wel leuere, þe Saxons seyd,</L><L>Þat þe lond were in partis leyd,</L><L>Þan þe Anglys of þe out ildes</L><L>Schulde be chef of alle þer <HI1 REND="i">gyldes</HI1>."</L><P>1338 A.D.

(He is speaking of the settling of the Angles in East-Anglia.)</P></NOTE1>I refer here once more, as I did in the note on p. lxix, for my statements as to the importance of the family among the German tribes, to the work of the greatest living master in German history, to the <FOREIGN>Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte</FOREIGN> by Waitz.  The reader will find there, that even after the German tribes had settled in fixed abodes, the family was of importance even within the community, which was founded then on the mere local relation of neighbourhood; and that this importance still continued when the division into hundreds not only existed, but was even prevalent.  When the community based on local relations, and no more on kinship, came into existence, all the <HI1 REND="i">political</HI1> interests fell at once into its sphere.  But all that regards the <HI1 REND="i">relations of private law</HI1>—the legal protection of life, limbs, and property—was still for a long time provided for by the family.  The Frith-Gilds, however, were only to take the place of the family as to these relations of private law, and not as to its long extinct political importance.  The Frith-Gilds, therefore, did not come into existence contemporancously with the origin of the community based on local relations, and with the formation of the State, but only later, when the family began to lose its importance in matters of private law also.  But the family had undoubtedly still this latter importance when the Anglo-Saxons came to England; this <EPB/><PB N="lviii"/>is proved by the very laws of Ina and Alfred which I speak of on p. lxxiv.  According to them, the paternal and maternal relatives of an offender are responsible in the first degree for his crime.</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:3.5.2" TYPE="note"><HEAD>2. <HI1 REND="i">Note to pp. lxxxvi, lxxxvii, on the name "Religious Gilds."</HI1></HEAD><P>As I see from a note added by Mr. Furnivall on p. lxxxvii, I was wrong in my supposition (see p. lxxxvi) as to the reason which induced Mr.  Toulmin Smith to change the hitherto usual name "Religious" into "Social" Gilds.  But Mr. Furnivall is equally mistaken as to my reasons for maintaining the old appellation.  As he thought, however, that these reasons were to be sought for in connexion with the fact of my being a Roman-Catholic, and as he has even asked me to state this fact to my readers, in order to caution them against my prejudices, I wish only, while doing this, to add a few words more on the real reasons for my calling these Gilds "Religious."</P><P>Now, to call the said Gilds "Religious" because of their ornament of a saint's name would seem to me quite as "monstrous" as to Mr. T. Smith or to Mr. Furnivall.  If this had been my reason, I should certainly call by the same name all or most of the other Gilds in the Middle Ages, besides those in question, as well as the Trade-Union of the Knights of St. Crispin in Massachusetts, referred to the other day by the <HI1 REND="i">Spectator</HI1>.  This would simply be to ridicule the word "religion."  I took this word in a much larger sense—in the sense it had when the old Gilds existed.  I fully agree with Mr. T. Smith, that the objects of the said Gilds were social ones.  But the exercise of these very social duties, to which the Gild brethren were bound by the Gild statutes—mutual assistance, the aid of the poor, of the helpless, the sick, of strangers, pilgrims, and prisoners, the burial of the dead, and even the keeping of schools and schoolmasters—was considered, in the time when these Gilds existed, as an "exercise of religion," <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">obsequium religionis</FOREIGN>, as Hincmar calls it (see pp. lxxxii, lxxxiii).  These deeds were considered but the practice of the religious maxim, "Love thy neighbour as thyself;" and most of them were taught to the people of the Middle Ages in a classification invented by the scholastics,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS101">They founded it on Matt. xxv.  See <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">S. Thomœ Summa Theol.</FOREIGN> ii. 2. qu. 32. art. 2.</NOTE1> as the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">opera corporalia misericordiæ</FOREIGN>.  Now, it can be easily understood that the people who considered the objects of these Gilds as "religious," gave the same name to the Gilds themselves which pursued these objects. In maintaining this name, I simply followed the example set by the Protestants as well as Roman-Catholics of all countries who have hitherto written on the subject.  My reason was partially that I thought a historical treatise ought to give its subject its historical name; but especially, as I pointed out on p. lxxxvi, that I feared that to call these Gilds "Social" Gilds, might mislead men to the opinion that the other kinds of Gilds were based on other than the same social principles on which these Gilds rest.  How the bad morals of the Roman clergy in the fourteenth century in England can prevent any one from calling the Gilds <EPB/><PB N="lix"/>existing among the laity from the days of Hincmar to the Reformation "Religious," I am at a loss to understand.  If the clergy were so little religious, I would rather refuse the name of "Religious" to the Social Gilds existing among them, to the Gilds of the Kalenders.  Yet Mr. Furnivall thinks that these last-named Gilds must be called so.  But I am told also by another friend, that the sense of the word "Religious" is to-day different in English from the sense in which I used it, and that it would mislead the reader as to the character of the said Gilds.  I therefore fully agree to the addition made by Mr. Furnivall to the title of my Part II., for certainly the <HI1 REND="i">main objects</HI1> of these Gilds we should to-day call "Social."</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:3.5.3" TYPE="note"><HEAD>3. <HI1 REND="i">Note to p. cxiv, on Bondmen in Towns and their Companies.</HI1></HEAD><P>Mr. Furnivall thought that the existence of bondmen in towns and of the companies into which they had been ranged by their masters, was a fact yet so little known to the English public, that a more detailed note on them would not be out of place.

To the former (the so-called <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">familia S. Petri</FOREIGN>) belonged the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">ministeriales, fiscalini</FOREIGN>, and <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">dagewardi</FOREIGN> (villeins). The villeins were obliged to render common services to the bishop, either as <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">coloni</FOREIGN> (villeins on the country manor), or as <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">operarii</FOREIGN> (handicraftsmen). Their bondage was exceedingly mild.  The amount of their wergild is not stated; but there is no doubt that it was paid entirely to the Church.  The marriage between the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">dagewardi</FOREIGN> and the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">fiscalini</FOREIGN> was a morganatic one; the children of it became <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">dagewardi</FOREIGN>. The larger part of the later handicraftsmen sprang from this class of villeins.  They were ranged, according to the kind of their services, into unions (<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">societates</FOREIGN>), which had an episcopal ministerialis as president (<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">minister</FOREIGN>).  These unions, later on, developed themselves into Craft-Gilds.  The villeins who did not work as handicraftsmen served as <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">coloni</FOREIGN> on the estates, where they were under the superintendence and jurisdiction of a <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">minister loci</FOREIGN>, like the handicraftsmen under that of their president.  Next to the villeins came the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">fiscalini</FOREIGN>, so called because originally servants to the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">fiscus</FOREIGN>, and belonging to the royal palace.  They rendered no common services, but services at court and in war.  They too were ranged into <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">societates</FOREIGN>.  But their unions soon became extinct.  First in the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">familia</FOREIGN> were the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">ministeriales</FOREIGN>. In opposition to these were the old freemen, who always preserved their privileges of rank before the bond-handicraftsmen, and who, later on, developed into patricians.</P><EPB/><PB N="lx"/><P>As there may be but few Englishmen who know that in England also villeins existed in towns, I insert here a note of one of the best Middle-Age men in England, the Rev. Professor William Stubbs, of Oxford, who kindly sent to Mr. Furnivall this note in answer to his question on the point:—"In all towns <HI1 REND="i">not chartered</HI1> there would be a class of <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">villani</FOREIGN> exactly the same as in the country manors.  The force of the bondage would of course vary, generally, very much from anything of the kind on the Continent.  But as originally all <HI1 REND="i">towns</HI1> were in demesne of some lord, bishop, or king, all the inhabitants would be less than free: and even where some had obtained the dignity of <HI1 REND="i">burgage</HI1>=socage tenure, still, until the town was freed by a charter, there would be a large residuum of <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">villani</FOREIGN>, whatever the hardship of English villenage may have been."</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:3.5.4" TYPE="note"><HEAD>4. <HI1 REND="i">Note to p. lxxxiv, note</HI1> 1.</HEAD><P>Mr. Ludlow answers this note as follows:—"I beg leave to say, that I am perfectly in earnest in saying that tramp-money in all probability is the modern representative of the relief to pilgrim-artificers; not that all pilgrim-artificers were workmen on the tramp, because I believe, with you, that these were a rare phenomenon in the fourteenth century—though I believe some were—but because I believe that this kind of pilgrimage tended necessarily to supersede the other, and therefore would naturally inherit its advantages.  Your reference to the 12th R. II. c. 3 is correc. but if you want a counter authority, see the 25th Edward III. St. i. c. 7, which shows that 'artificers' also were expected to 'flee' from one county to the other in consequence of the law itself.  Now a pilgrimage to a shrine would evidently be the safest colour for such a migration; under all circumstances it would afford the best safeguard against local exactions and maltreatment. See also as to the abuse of pilgrimage the 12th R. II. c. 7."</P><P>This explanation is very ingenious.  Yet it does not convince me. The artificers whom the 25th Edw. III. expects to flee from one <HI1 REND="i">county</HI1>to another, seem to me not to have been town-artificers.  They were, in my opinion, artificers working on the country manors of lords.  Each country manor had in the Middle Ages its own artificers, who supplied the common wants of their lords, whilst the latter resorted only for their more refined wants to the craftsmen of the towns.  This explanation of the Act in question seems to me the more probable when we consider that all Statutes of Labourers in the Middle Ages were framed especially with regard to the powers and wants of the landed proprietors, the feudal lords.  In towns, labour was generally regulated by town-ordinances.  Besides, we must remember that the exercise of a craft in towns depended on having served an apprenticeship in such towns, and on citizenship (see p. cxxix).  A fleeing craftsman would not therefore have been admitted into towns to carry on his craft.  Such fleeing to towns therefore would have been useless.</P></DIV3></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:3.6" TYPE="contents"><EPB/><PB N="lxi"/><HEAD>CONTENTS.</HEAD><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:3.6.1" TYPE="argument"><HEAD>I.

The primary meaning is a feast, then the company assembled; and the same transference of signification will be observed in the word <HI1 REND="i">company</HI1> itself, which, signifying in the first instance 'a number of persons eating together,' has come to be applied to an association for any purpose, and, in the case of the City Companies, to the very associations which were formerly denominated Guilds.</P><P>"It is a mistake to connect the word with the German <FOREIGN>geld</FOREIGN>, payment.

THE ORIGIN OF GILDS.</HEAD><P>THE oldest reliable and detailed accounts which we have of Gilds come from England; they consist of three Gild-statutes.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS105">See these in Kemble's <HI1 REND="i">The Saxons in England,</HI1> vol. i., Appendix D; and compare with them the translation in Eden's <HI1 REND="i">State of the Poor,</HI1> vol. i. p. 591, &amp;c.</NOTE1>According to the latest investigation<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS106">Hartwig, <FOREIGN>Untersuchungen über die ersten Anfänge des Gildewesens</FOREIGN>, in the <FOREIGN>Forschungen zur deutschen Geschichte</FOREIGN>, edited by Waitz, Göttingen, 1860, vol. i. p. 136.</NOTE1> into the origin of Gilds, the drawing-up of all these statutes took place in the beginning of the eleventh century.  In the case of one of these Gilds, there is no doubt whatever as to the accuracy of this date.  This Gild was founded and richly endowed by Orcy, a friend of Canute the Great, at Abbotsbury, in honour of God and St. Peter.  Its object, according to the statutes, appears to have been the support and nursing of infirm Gild-brothers, the burial of the dead, and the performance of religious services, and the saying of prayers, for their souls.  The association met every year, on the feast of St. Peter, for united worship in honour of their patron saint.  Besides this, there was a common meal; and in order that the poor might also have their share in the joys of the festival, they received alms on the day of the feast; for which purpose the Gild-brothers were obliged to furnish, on the eve of the day, contributions of bread "well boulted and thoroughly baked."  Guests were only admitted to the common meal by permission of the Master and Steward.  Insults offered in a malignant spirit by one brother to another, were punished on the part of the Gild, and had also to be atoned for to the insulted.  He who had undertaken an office, but had not properly discharged its duties, was severely punished.</P><P>The Exeter Gild, whose statutes have likewise been preserved, was of altogether the same character.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS107">See also the Introduction to Mr. Smith's <HI1 REND="i">Gilds</HI1> by Miss L. T. Smith, p. xviii.</NOTE1>  Here, however, association <EPB/><PB N="lxvi"/>for the purpose of worship and prayer stands out more prominently as the object of the brotherhood than in the former case.  Three times a year the Gild-brothers assembled to worship together for the well-being of their living and dead fellow-members. Here, also, every such service was followed by a meal in common.  When any brother died, every member was obliged to perform special devotions for the departed soul.  The mutual care of the Gild-brothers was, moreover, shown by money-contributions in case of death, and in the support of those who went on a journey, as well as of those who had suffered loss by fire.  Punishments were decreed for insults offered by the Gild-brothers to each other, as well as for not fulfilling the duties imposed on them by the Gild.</P><P>The statutes of the Gild at Cambridge show that its main object was altogether different from that of the two already mentioned. At the very outset, in the oath which every member had to take on the relics of the patron Saint of the Gild, they swore faithful brotherhood towards each other, not only in religious, but also in secular matters; and though the statutes secured for the Gild-brothers the same support in case of sickness and death as those of Exeter and Abbotsbury—and, like those, contained regulations with reference to alms, divine worship and feasts—yet all these objects were but insignificant in comparison with the measures for the protection of the members of the Gild against criminals, and even against the evil consequences of their own wrongdoing.  The following may be considered a first principle: "If one misdo, let all bear it; let all share the same lot;" and for carrying this out, a complete organization existed. If one of the Gild-brothers required the help of his fellow-members, the inferior officer of the Gild living nearest to him had to hasten to his aid; should the officer neglect this, he became liable to punishment, and in like manner the head of the society, should he be remiss in affording help.  If a Gild-brother was robbed, the whole Gild had to assist him in obtaining compensation from the lawbreaker.  So also every Gild-brother was obliged to help, if a member himself had to make atonement for killing a man.  If, however, he had no justifiable motive for committing the act, if he had not been provoked to it in a quarrel, if he was not under an obligation to execute vengeance, but had slain the man merely from malice, he himself had to bear the consequences of the deed.  If one Gild-brother killed another, he had first to reconcile himself with the kinsmen of the murdered man, and had moreover to pay eight pounds to all those belonging to his larger family, namely, the Gild; failing which, he was shut out of the society, and the <EPB/><PB N="lxvii"/>members of the Gild were forbidden to hold friendly intercourse of any kind with him.  In like manner, an insult offered by one Gild-brother to another was severely punished.  The solidarity of the society was even shown in the case of violence and damage to property, which one member might have suffered from the servant of another; the master of the servant was answerable for him, and was sued by the society for compensation. It was, moreover, a leading principle of the society, to which every member had to bind himself by oath, always to support him who had right on his side.</P><P>The essence of the manifold regulations of the statutes of these three Gilds appears to be the brotherly banding together into close unions between man and man, sometimes even established on and fortified by oath, for the purpose of mutual help and support. This essential characteristic is found in all the Gilds of every age, from those first known to us in detail, to their descendants of the present day, the Trade-Unions.  According to the variety of wants and interests at various times, the aims, arrangements, and rules of these unions also varied.  As a rule, the Gild-brothers periodically assembled together for common feasts.</P><P>The inquiry as to where these features of the Gilds are first met with in earlier times will, perhaps, also yield an answer to the inquiry into the origin of Gilds themselves.  The Northern historians, in answer to the question, whence the Gilds sprang, refer above all to the feasts of the German tribes from Scandinavia, which were first called Gilds.  Among the German tribes, every occurrence among the more nearly related members of the family required the active participation in it of them all. At births, marriages, and deaths, all the members of the family assembled.  Banquets were prepared in celebration of the event, and these had sometimes even a legal signification, as in the case of funeral banquets, namely, that of entering on an inheritance; and, when they concerned kings, that of a coronation. Wilda narrates in detail the circumstances of a banquet of this kind, at which the son and heir, in the midst of his own and his father's companions, toasted his father's memory, and vowed to imitate his worthy deeds; the companions took similar vows upon themselves.  Further, great social banquets took place on occasion of the sacrificial assemblies at the great anniversary festivals, which coincided with the national assemblies and legal assizes, and on occasion of important political events; and at the same time the common concerns of the community were deliberated on at these banquets.  Moreover, they also furnished an opportunity for the conclusion of those alliances for purposes of plunder or war, of which we have accounts, especially in the case of Sweden <EPB/><PB N="lxviii"/>and Norway, as well as of those close unions of friends, in which, according to the Scandinavian Sagas, two warriors of antiquity were wont to confederate for life or death, for common enterprises and dangers, and for indiscriminate revenge when one of them should perish by a violent death.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS108">Münter's <FOREIGN>Kirchengeschichte,</FOREIGN> vol. i. p. 181, &amp;c., quoted in Wilda's <FOREIGN>Gildewesen im Mittelalter,</FOREIGN> p. 29.</NOTE1>  Every freeman was obliged to attend these feasts, and bring with him whatever food and drink he might require.  Hence these feasts were also called Gilds; for "Gild" meant originally the sacrificial meal made up of the common contributions; then a sacrificial banquet in general; and lastly, a society.  When in later times Christianity spread itself in the North, the sacrificial banquets, with all their customs and ceremonies, remained in existence, and Christ, the Virgin Mary, and other saints, stept into the place of Odin and the rest of the gods.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS109">Compare Wilda, <FOREIGN>Das Gildewesen im Mittelalter,</FOREIGN> Halle, 1831, p. 5, &amp;c. ; Waitz, <FOREIGN>Deutsche Verfassungs-Geschichte,</FOREIGN> vol. i. pp. 49-75, 2nd ed., Kiel, 1865; Hartwig, pp. 148, 149.</NOTE1></P><P>Neither Wilda, the principal writer on Gilds, nor Hartwig, who has made the latest researches into their origin, is able to discover anything of the essential nature of Gilds, either in what has just been related about the old family and its banquets, or in the sacrificial assemblies; and it is only as to the one point of the custom of holding banquets on the occasion of anniversary festivals, that Wilda is inclined to derive the Gilds from them.  But of the essence of the Gild, "the brotherly banding together in close union, which expressed itself in manifold ways in the mutual rendering of help and support," he finds no trace.  "The banquets," he urges as his principal objection, "were either casual meetings to which every one, as he thought proper, invited his friends, or which several people prepared in common, and which did not produce any more intimate relationship than that already existing from the actual bond of the family, or state, or neighbourhood; or they were meetings in which every one of the nation was able, or was obliged, to take part.  There appears in them nothing of any closer voluntary confederacy of the members within, or by the side of, the union caused by the State or religion."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS110">Wilda, p. 28.</NOTE1>  Hartwig considers these objections of Wilda's conclusive, and believes that from the continued existence of pagan ceremonies even amongst the religious Gilds, and from the custom of holding feasts, nothing whatever can be deduced which is essential to the Gilds.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS111">Hartwig, p. 153.</NOTE1></P><P>Now these feasts cannot certainly be compared with the <EPB/><PB N="lxix"/>already perfectly-developed Gilds of Abbotsbury, Exeter, and Cambridge; but if we connect with them what historians relate about the family in those days, we may still recognize in them the germ from which in later times, at a certain stage of civilization, the Gild necessarily had to develope itself.  The family was, according to these historians,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS112">To avoid further quotations I refer to Waitz, vol. i. pp. 49-75.  With referance to the Anglo-Saxons in particular, see also Lappenberg's <FOREIGN>Geschichte von England,</FOREIGN> vol. i. 1834, p. 587.</NOTE1> a community of all-comprehending importance, and its care provided completely for nearly all the wants of the individual.  This it was able to do in consequence of the then simplicity of life.  The minor found in it his protection; the insulted, the natural friends who sympathized most keenly with him in every injury inflicted, and who helped him to procure satisfaction.  He who would engage in those pursuits which alone in that age were worthy of a free man, and which at the same time promised riches and fame—in chase, feuds, and war—found in the family his natural allies. Naturally, he who fell into poverty, or sickness, or any other kind of distress, obtained from the family the necessary help; and it provided of course for the burial of the dead whose heir it was. These are indeed the first, and are even now-a-days the practical results of the family union.  For the murdered, there arose from the midst of his family an avenger; to the robbed it gave the necessary help to prosecute and punish the thief, and to obtain restitution of the plunder.  Further consequences of the nature of the family compact were, that the members were obliged to maintain peace amongst themselves; that they were not entitled to appear against each other in a court of justice; and, on the other hand, that they were called upon to punish members, especially women, who had violated the right of the family.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS113">By unchastity, as wives or girls.</NOTE1>Before the community too it became answerable for its members. The payment of the forfeited <FOREIGN LANG="OE">wergild</FOREIGN> was, in all cases of offence—which according to ancient usage and custom claimed revenge—the concern of the whole family.  The family appeared as such an intimate union of its members, that this responsibility of the whole body for the individual member commended itself to the sense of justice of the people as a matter of course.  But as it answered for the compensation, and took part in the payment thereof, and assisted the guilty in order that he might not forfeit life and limbs to his antagonist, so it supplied the accused also with compurgators from among its members to ward off an unjust condemnation.  In former times this family bond comprehended all relatives without limitation of degree; <EPB/><PB N="lxx"/>but in later days it became restricted to the nearer kinsfolk. Of course these members of the family met at oft-recurring banquets, at which, as was customary among the Germans, their interests were talked over and deliberated on, just as has been shown in the above-mentioned accounts of the Scandinavian writers (p. lxviii), who agree in this with Tacitus (<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Germ.</FOREIGN> cap. 22).</P><P>If we compare this description of the family, and the accounts of the above-mentioned banquets, with the statutes of the Gilds at Abbotsbury, Exeter, and Cambridge, the family appears as the original and pattern type, after which all the later Gilds were formed; and this will be proved still more clearly in the course of this treatise.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS114">Compare especially Part III. of this Essay, pp. cii, ciii.</NOTE1>  The family meets us here as the closest possible union, consisting of real brothers, and so thoroughly animated with the spirit of brotherhood and of mutual assistance and support, that it brings all conceivable relations within its reach, and provides completely for nearly all those wants, the satisfying of which fell, in later times, partly to the State, and partly to the artificial societies which were formed for this very purpose.  The essential nature of the Gild, as characterized by Wilda himself, is to be found in the family, and developed there even to the highest degree. We do not yet see, it is true, special associations by the side of this most intimate natural union, but neither is there room for the former, by reason of the activity of the latter.  It is indeed astonishing that Wilda, who himself afterwards designates the Gilds as "imitators of the family,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS115">Wilda, pp. 56-58, 130, 132, 134, 147, 153, 169, &amp;c.</NOTE1> should here altogether forget whence they were derived.</P><P>With the exception of political interests, for which the State provided, there remains only one relation for which we find no particular provision in the family, namely, Religion.  Care for the interests of religion was the business of the whole nation. At the time from which our accounts come down to us, the German tribes had already taken possession of fixed habitations; the relations of neighbourhood and of living-together asserted themselves in public life, and it was natural that the interests which first after politics united neighbours for common action, were the religious ones.  Families, though acting generally as independent individual bodies, and competing most keenly with each other in the pursuit of their material interests, yet united as soon as <HI1 REND="i">that</HI1> interest was concerned, which—even in the times of the most barbarian arbitrariness and the most unbridled clublaw, the times of the most unchecked pursuit of individual <EPB/><PB N="lxxi"/>interest—was always considered as the great, the common, the social interest, the reconciliation of man with God.  As if single individuals felt themselves too weak to solve this great problem, they have always, at all times, and in all religions, united for the worship of God,—frequently the whole nation, and later, in special sacrificial societies, as we see in the religious associations of the Romans,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS116">Cf. Heineccius, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">De collegiis et corporibus opificum,</FOREIGN> in <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Heineccii opera omnia,</FOREIGN>tom. ii. p. 390, Genevæ, 1766; also Cicero <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">De Senectute,</FOREIGN> cap. 13.  Gaius, in l. 4 D. de coll. et corp. 47, 22, quotes a passage from Solon's legislation taken over into the twelve tables concerning <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">sacrorum sacramentales.</FOREIGN></NOTE1> and still more perfectly in the religious Gilds and fraternities of the Middle Ages.</P><P>The circumstance, that we meet here, all neighbours united in one common society, and not yet that separation into closer and more restricted associations which is found in the later Gilds, can give rise to no difficulty.  This is a phenomenon which appears always, as soon as a great interest unites men into a community, and which repeats itself in the rise of every separate kind of Gild down to that of our modern Trade-Unions.  At first, as long as all belonging to one portion of mankind have an equally lively sense of want, as long as zeal is universal, and energy is equally effective in all, and as long as this zeal is still growing, <HI1 REND="i">one</HI1> bond comprehends them all; but gradually, with the increase of number, and with the relaxation of the general interest, or with the appearance of various shades in that interest, they unite into closer societies, or close their circles; by the side of which then arise others of a similar nature.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS117">Compare Part III. pp. xcvi, xcvii.</NOTE1>  When, for instance—to make use of an example which Hartwig himself brings forward in a later passage of his inquiry—the Christian communions were formed, all the members contributed, according to their ability, to one common fund for the purpose of good works.  With the extension of Christianity this general display of love abated; the contributions ceased, or were changed into regular and involuntary taxes; and the zealous separated into particular brotherhoods, &amp;c.  Further, the Gilds, from which in later times the town constitutions sprang, comprehended originally, as Wilda himself tells us, all full citizens, whose relations to each other were none but those given by local limits and the bonds of neighbourhood.  To the first Gilds of the Kalenders, all the priests of a deanery belonged, and the first Trade-Unions took their origin in a manner thoroughly similar.</P><P>The essence of the Gild existed also in those associations for acquiring riches and fame, the sworn confederacies for plunder and heroic deeds referred to above, and mentioned <EPB/><PB N="lxxii"/>by the Northern historians; and therefore, although from the natural scantiness of the sources, historical references to the direct derivation of the Gilds from them may be wanting, it does not appear that the attempt to bring them into connection with the Gilds ought to be rejected without further counterproofs.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS118">Against this view, on wholly insufficient grounds, see Wilda, p. 29; and without stating any grounds, Hartwig, p. 154.</NOTE1></P><P>As to the positive opinion of the opponents of our view of the origin of Gilds:—Wilda allows that the later Gilds are derived from the old pagan ones, as regards the custom of assembling together at a common meal on various solemn occasions (a custom, however, which is certainly met with, not only among the Germans, but also in the Greek ἔρανοι and the Roman <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Collegia</FOREIGN>).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS119">Hartwig, p. 156.  Varro speaks of the licentious banquets of the Roman collegia:  <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Immutabiles collegiorum cœnas intendere annonam."</FOREIGN>  Cf. Heineccius, pp. 386, 399.  As to the ἔρανοι, see Becker's <FOREIGN LANG="GRE">Charikles,</FOREIGN> vol. ii. p. 239, 2nd edition, 1854.</NOTE1>  The peculiar characteristic of the Gilds, says Wilda, first entered into them through the Christian principle of love for one's neighbour; and the Gilds themselves had their origin in the monasteries aggregated together on that principle to share in the benefits of their prayers and good works.  These aggregations were joined afterwards by laymen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS120">Wilda, p. 31 ff.</NOTE1>  Against this view, Hartwig shows the untenableness of the derivation of the Gilds from those monastic aggregations,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS121">Hartwig, p. 152.</NOTE1> and then points to the Gild-like unions of the cultivated and classical nations of antiquity, especially to the Roman burial-societies, which Christianity, as it spread, found already existing on an extensive scale. He then mentions the common contributions of the first Christians for good works, as well as the later discontinuance of these voluntary acts of charity of the laity, when the Church acquired great independent wealth.  But, in spite of the immense property of the Frankish Church, Hartwig yet infers, from the existence of a great proletariat in the Frankish realm at the end of the Roman dominion, that associations of clergy and laity for mutual support must have been formed in that empire. Though more exact information concerning these is wanting, yet the existence of associations amongst the clergy of the sixth century for anything but pious purposes,—as for instance for opposing superiors,—appears to Hartwig sufficient reason for inferring the existence of similar ones for charitable purposes. The laity would join themselves at a later period to those societies, whose offshoots he sees in the Gilds of the Kalenders.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS122">Hartwig, pp. 156-160.  See, on the Gilds of the Kalenders, p. lxxxviii below.</NOTE1></P><EPB/><PB N="lxxiii"/><P>It seems, however, difficult to agree with this learned and ingeniously asserted opinion.  The development shows too many gaps, and the connection of the isolated facts with each other is too weak for us to erect with its scaffold the great and magnificent edifice of the Gilds.</P><P>The assumption that the Gild first obtained its essential character, and its true purport, from the Christian communions only, seems to me also very difficult to reconcile with the facts so prominently brought forward by Wilda and Hartwig, that the customs and ceremonies of the Gilds of that age were to such an extent those of the old pagan sacrificial banquets, that, for centuries, prohibitions and menaces of punishment were expressly needed in order to destroy this pagan character. If I may be allowed to form a conjecture in this case, I would rather say that the religious brotherhoods of the Middle Ages, and as they still exist in Catholic countries, have their origin in a connection with monasticism, and in an imitation of it on the part of men who, though wishing to accumulate the greatest possible amount of merits for the next world, yet would not renounce the present; and that this origin is to be sought in Southern lands, in which Christianity and monasticism were first propagated.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS123">It follows from ll. 42 and 43 <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Cod. Theod. de Parabolanis,</FOREIGN> lib. 16, tit. 2 (with which must be compared the commentary of Gothofredus on these passages, as well as Baronius, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Annales Ecclesiastici,</FOREIGN> tom. v. p. 691, Romæ, 1595, and Stolberg's <FOREIGN>Geschichte der Religion Jesu Christi,</FOREIGN> vol. xv. p. 44, Hamburg, 1818), that already in the third century there existed at Alexandria a Christian brotherhood for nursing the sick.  But about the year 416 it had so altered its character, and had so degenerated, as a religious institution, that Theodosius published a decree to prevent it from becoming too powerful, and from meddling with secular affairs.</NOTE1>  When, therefore, these Southerns brought Christianity into the North, they found existing there these pagan sacrificial unions, with their attendant banquets; and an amalgamation of the Christian religious unions was effected with the sacrificial societies of the pagans, and their customs and rites, like the blending of the Christian festivals and ceremonies with those of the old pagans, which Wilda narrates in so excellent a way.  But though this continued existence of the old customs was at first allowed in the interest of the more rapid propagation of Christian doctrine, yet in later times, when the dominion of the doctrine appeared to have been secured, a war was commenced against them by the spiritual authorities as well as the secular ones, who were animated with similar ideas.  Undoubtedly, however, the spirit of association received then a mighty impulse, and the Gilds spread themselves rapidly under the influence of Christian doctrine; but, at any rate, as it <EPB/><PB N="lxxiv"/>seems to me, the essence of the Gild, the confederation in societies for mutual help, where the power of the individual appeared too weak to obtain the object desired, is already to be recognized in those old heathen sacrificial assemblies.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS124">Both Waitz (vol. i. p. 85) and Lappenberg (vol. i. p. 609) appear to believe in this derivation of the Gilds.</NOTE1></P><P>Though in more ancient times the family connection was strong, and of importance in various ways, as in the maintenance of justice, in the formation of the nation, and in its first settlement, nevertheless, after this settlement had taken place, the relations which it called forth obtained the preponderance.  The natural bond of the family became more and more relaxed with the increase of the number of relatives, and with the rise of special interests among the individual members; and would also lose its importance as regards the maintenance of justice. Moreover, the constantly increasing number of kinless people, and of strangers, would further the formation of new institutions; for the State alone was not at that time able to satisfy its members' claims for legal protection.</P><P>This change had, above all, to take place in the Anglo-Saxon States<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS125">See Additional Notes, No. 1.</NOTE1> through the intermixture of the people with Britons and Danes.  Here, artificial alliances would take the place of the natural ones, and of the frankpledge<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS126">The mutual security which persons of the same tithing gave for each other's good conduct.</NOTE1> founded thereon.  Already, in passages of Ina's statutes which refer expressly to the legal protection of the stranger, mention is made of <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"gegildan"</FOREIGN>and <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"gesið;"</FOREIGN> and strangers are the very people who, we are told, lived, later on, in societies or Gilds, to which probably a great antiquity must be ascribed.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS127">Waitz, vol. i. p. 437.</NOTE1>  A law of King Alfred declared, that when any one who had no paternal relatives, killed another, one-third of the fine should be paid by the maternal relatives, another third by the <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"gegildan,"</FOREIGN> while for the remaining third the man himself was responsible.  But if he was also without maternal relatives, the <FOREIGN LANG="OE">"gegildan"</FOREIGN> had to pay the half, and for the other half "let him flee."

From them, the Gilds in and about London appear to have united into <HI1 REND="i">one</HI1> Gild, and to have framed common regulations for the better maintenance of peace, for the suppression of violence,—especially of theft, and the aggressions of the powerful families,—as well as for carrying out rigidly the ordinances enacted by the king for that purpose.  Particularly comprehensive were the arrangements for prosecution against theft; one might call these Gilds "assurance companies against theft." Not only were the members obliged to pursue and track out the thief, even in other districts, but the injured person also received compensation for his loss from the common fund. The agreements which had been come to, and the obligation resulting therefrom, bound not only the members of the Gilds, but also all non-members living in the district in which the Gilds existed; and the non-members were for this purpose united into tithings under the lead of the Gild-brothers.  Every month the members of the Gild assembled at a banquet, at which the common interests, the observance of the ordinances enacted, and similar matters, were inquired into and discussed.  The remains of the viands were distributed amongst the poor.  On the death of a member, every associate of the Gild had to offer a loaf of fine bread for the benefit of the soul of the departed, and had to sing fifty psalms, or to get them sung, within the space of a month.  All who took part in this league were to be as the members of <HI1 REND="i">one</HI1> Gild, in <HI1 REND="i">one</HI1> friendship, and in <HI1 REND="i">one</HI1> enmity; and every insult was to be avenged as a common one.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS131">Cf.

The wanton practices and heathen customs which prevailed at their banquets, as well as the exaction of the contributions and fines which, as in the London and Cambridge Statutes, were imposed for violation of the ordinances, gave Hincmar occasion for vehement complaints against these Gilds.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS138">Cf. Wilda, pp. 22, 35, 41; Hartwig, pp. 138-141, 150.</NOTE1>  We see from these accusations that the despotic mediæval magnates of the Continent used the same weapons for attacking associations for the maintenance of freedom, as their modern antagonists in free England, the enemies of Trade-Unions.</P><EPB/><PB N="lxxvii"/><P>There is no doubt that these <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Gildoniæ"</FOREIGN> of the Frankish Empire are the same as the Gilds of the Anglo-Saxons, such as those of London and Cambridge.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS139">Cf. Hartwig, pp. 138-142, who also, together with Marquardsen, maintains against Kemble the real identity of the London brotherhoods with the remaining Anglo-Saxon Gilds.</NOTE1>  The more developed constitution of these appears merely as a consequence of the later times from which the documents on them have been preserved for us, as well as of the freedom from those restrictions which necessarily hindered their prosperity on the Continent.  As the unions themselves owed their origin to social and political changes, in like manner the reasons of these prohibitions lay probably in political and social considerations.  All the various kinds of Gilds—as will further appear in the course of this inquiry—always arose in times of transition; and especially when we consider the origin of Trade-Unions we shall show how, in every single trade, the Gilds came into existence at the time when each trade was changing from small to great industry.  When these Gilds arose, both England and the Frankish Empire were likewise in such a stage of transition.  The frankpledges of those belonging to one family became less efficient.  Lappenberg relates, that in England<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS140">Lappenberg, vol. i. p. 587, &amp;c.</NOTE1> the landed proprietor, the feudal lord, took all his serfs under the same protection as in earlier times was afforded by their kinsmen.  This relation could not however satisfy the want of the great numbers of those who had maintained their freedom, and did not belong to any connection of this kind. Amongst these freemen, therefore, we forthwith meet the same contrast which now-a-days separates Economists and Socialists. The freemen of rank and large possessions, who felt themselves powerful enough for their own protection, found, as the strong are ever wont to do, their interest more in a system of mutual feuds, that is, of free competition amongst themselves, than in associations and mutual pledges.  But the less powerful, the small freemen, sought, as the weak always do, protection for themselves in confederating into close unions, and formed the Gilds for that purpose.</P><P>The mighty efforts of the Emperor Charlemagne to form one central State, transformed all existing relations.  His legislation caused especially a considerable diminution of the old freemen. With the pressure which the violent dukes and counts exercised on the people, the number of the latter shrank more and more, exactly as the number of small master-craftsmen and tradesmen dwindled away in consequence of the centralization of trade into the great workshops in the eighteenth and nineteenth <EPB/><PB N="lxxviii"/>centuries in England.  Just as here the artisans could only avoid being pressed down to a slavelike condition by leaguing together into unions, so in like manner the old freemen of Charles's time were only able to maintain their liberties wherever the fact of their dwelling together in larger numbers rendered a confederacy into Gilds possible, or wherever they were secured against the persecution of their oppressors by the peculiar natural conditions of their abode.  Although, later on, Charles himself endeavoured in vain to counteract the diminution of the old freemen—so far as it was possible without injuring his system—yet the action of an organization like the Gilds would have made breaches in it; moreover, these stirs of self-help might have become dangerous to the system of personal government of the arbitrarily ruling Cæsar.</P><P>But the universal insecurity after the death of Charles, and especially the devastating incursions of the Normans, were the causes that brought about the association of the people into Gilds, even more than the fear of losing their inherited freedom.  But here too it was the same dread that caused self-help to be forbidden; and this was certainly also the cause of the prohibition of the associations amongst serfs against thieves and robbers. The crime of the serfs in their unions consisted in their endeavouring to provide redress for their grievances without making use of the intervention of their masters,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS141">The <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Capit. Vern.</FOREIGN> 884, cap. 14 (Pertz, l. c., p. 553) says: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Volumus, ut presbyteri et ministri comitis villanis præcipiant, ne collectam faciant quam vulgo Geldam vocant contra illos qui aliquid rapuerint.

The suppression of those stirrings of self-dependence appeared a matter of public importance. Heineccius<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS146">Heineccius, l. c., p. 379.</NOTE1> already, <HI1 REND="i">apropos</HI1> of the interdiction of the Roman <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">collegia</FOREIGN> by Tarquinius Superbus, refers to the opinion of Aristotle (<HI1 REND="i">Polit.</HI1> lib. v. cap. ii.): "The means already indicated to maintain the mastery as long as possible, consist in this especially, to suffer neither common banquets nor political unions, nor education in common, nor anything else of the same kind; but to guard against everything which can excite in the people these two qualities—self-consciousness and mutual confidence."  If these associations of serfs were also directed against their lords, we have indeed in that Capitulary the first record of a combination of labourers against their masters.</P><P>The forbiddance of Gilds in the Frankish Empire could also be justified from religious motives, in consequence of the gluttony and pagan customs always associated with them.  But from England we hear nothing whatever of any evil influence of the Gilds.  It appears that Englishmen at all times knew better than Continentals how to maintain their right of free and independent action; and their Government seems to have known even at that time how to make use, in an excellent manner and in the interest of public order, of organizations freely created by the people.  In Germany a better estimation of the Gilds seems to have commenced under Henry I., who in order to raise the towns, ordered the Gilds to hold their councils, their meetings, and their banquets in them.  The same thing was decreed for Norway nearly a century and a half later by Olaf Kirre, the <EPB/><PB N="lxxx"/>founder of Bergen, and the enlarger of several towns.  He also caused houses to be built for this purpose, as for instance at Trondjem.</P><P>There remains, in conclusion, to state briefly the chief result of this inquiry.  The family appears as the first Gild, or at least as an archetype of the Gilds.  Originally, its providing care satisfies all existing wants; and for other societies there is therefore no room.  As soon however as wants arise which the family can no longer satisfy—whether on account of their peculiar nature or in consequence of their increase, or because its own activity grows feeble—closer artificial alliances immediately spring forth to provide for them, in so far as the State does not do it.  Infinitely varied as are the wants which call them forth, so are naturally the objects of these alliances.  Yet the basis on which they all rest is the same: all are unions between man and man, not mere associations of capital like our modern societies and companies.  The cement which holds their members together is the feeling of solidarity, the esteem for each other as men, the honour and virtue of the associates and the faith in them—not an arithmetical rule of probabilities, indifferent to all good and bad personal qualities.  The support which the community affords a member is adjusted according to his wants—not according to his money-stake, or to a jealous debtor and creditor account; and in like manner the contributions of the members vary according to the wants of the society, and it therefore never incurs the danger of bankruptcy, for it possesses an inexhaustible reserve fund in the infinitely elastic productive powers of its members.  In short, whatever and however diverse may be their aims, the Gilds take over from the family the spirit which held it together and guided it: they are its faithful image, though only for special and definite objects.</P><P>The first societies formed on these principles were the sacrificial unions, from which, later on, the Religious Gilds were developed for association in prayer and good works.  Then, as soon as the family could no longer satisfy the need for legal protection, unions of artificial-family members were formed for this purpose, as the State was not able to afford the needful help in this respect. These Gilds however had their origin in direct imitation of the family.  Most certainly, none were developed from an earlier religious union: as little as were the Roman <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">collegia opificum</FOREIGN> from the Roman sacrificial societies, or the Craft-Gilds from the Gild-Merchants, or any Trade-Unions from a Craft-Gild.</P></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:3.8" TYPE="section"><EPB/><PB N="lxxxi"/><HEAD>II. THE RELIGIOUS (OR SOCIAL) GILDS.</HEAD><P>AFTER the German tribes had settled in fixed abodes, the families dwelling in a certain district united themselves into common sacrificial assemblies.  As a rule, common meals were connected with them, to which every one taking part had to bring what he wanted of food and drink.  From this these unions were called <HI1 REND="i">Gilds</HI1>.  When Christianity, together with its religious fraternities, came to the North, the latter amalgamated with the heathen sacrificial societies which they found there, and from this union arose the Religious Gilds of the Middle Ages.</P><P>This is the opinion on the origin of the Religious Gilds already expounded in the foregoing part of this Essay.  In the above cited statutes of the Gilds at Abbotsbury and Exeter, of the eleventh century (p. lxv), we see the organization of these Gilds already completely developed.  But much earlier, though less detailed, information is afforded by the Capitularies of Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims, of the year 858.</P><P>We find, already distinct, in these Capitularies, the two kinds which must be distinguished among the Religious Gilds.  The one exists among laymen; and it alone is called <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Geldonia."</FOREIGN>  It alone, too, bears already the complete character of the Religious Gilds as it existed during the whole of the Middle Ages.  The other kind of Gild exists among the clergy.</P><P>In the Capitulary<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS147"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Labbei Concilia</FOREIGN>, ed. Coleti, t. x. cap. 16. p. 4:<FOREIGN LANG="LAT"> "De confratriis, earumque conventibus, quomodo celebrari debeant.—Ut de collectis, quas geldonias vel confratrias vulgo vocant, sicut jam verbis monuimus, et nunc scriptis expresse præcipimus, tantum fiat, quantum ad auctoritatem, et utilitatem, atque rationem pertinet: ultra autem nemo, neque sacerdos, neque fidelis quisquam, in parochia nostra progredi audeat.

He first tells them quite in general, that only that should be done which was required by dignity, utility, and reason; but he immediately defines this somewhat more precisely: "They shall unite for every exercise of religion: that is to say,"—and now follows, as a more detailed statement of the duties involved therein, the enumeration of all the objects which are again met with in the later Gild-statutes,—"they shall unite for offerings (especially of candles), for mutual assistance, for funeral services for the dead, for alms, and other deeds of piety."  On the other hand, Hincmar forbids, what other Capitularies term <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"diabolicum"</FOREIGN>(which must be translated here by "heathenisms"),<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS148">See Hartwig, pp. 142, 153.</NOTE1> namely, feastings and drinking-bouts, because they led to drunkenness, gave occasion for unjust exactions, for sordid merriments, and inane railleries, and ended often even with quarrels, hatred, and manslaughter.  If it was the priest of the Gild or any other clergyman who acted against this prohibition, he was to be degraded, but if it was a layman or a woman, he or she was to be excluded until satisfaction was given.  If it became necessary to call a meeting of the brothers, as, for instance, for the arrangement of differences which might have arisen among them, they were to assemble after divine service; and after the necessary admonitions, every one who liked was to obtain from the priest a piece of consecrated bread and a goblet of wine; and then he was to go home with the blessing of God.</P><P>These fraternities were spread in the Middle Ages, in great numbers, over all countries under the sway of the Roman-Catholic religion, and they exist even now in such countries.  As the Gild Statutes contained in this collection—and they are but waifs and strays of large flocks—show, these brotherhoods existed in considerable numbers in every town; thus there were twelve in Norwich, as many in Lynn, in Bishop's Lynn nine, <EPB/><PB N="lxxxiii"/>while abroad, Gallienus counts even eighty in Cologne, Melle about seventy at Lübeck, and Staphorst more than a hundred at Hamburg.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS149">See Wilda, p. 346.</NOTE1>  But their objects and organizations were so identical everywhere, and remained so essentially unchanged during successive centuries, that a comparison of them in various countries and at various times could only lead to repetitions. I will therefore simply state their objects and their organization. What is described here, prevailed in all countries alike.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS150">Compare, for what is said in the following, the Gild Statutes contained in Mr. Smith's collection, the Introduction by Miss Smith, pp. xxviii-xlii, Wilda, pp. 344-375, and Ouin-Lacroix, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Histoire des anciennes Corporations d'Arts et Méticrs et des Confréries religieuses de la capitale de la Normandie,</FOREIGN> Rouen, 1850, pp. 411-542.</NOTE1></P><P>With regard to the objects of these Gilds, Hincmar defines them completely, when he says, "in omni obsequio religionis conjungantur," they shall unite in every exercise of religion.  By this were meant, before all things, the associations for the veneration of certain religious mysteries, and in honour of saints.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS151">The modern representative of this is the march of the members of the English village Benefit-Societies to morning service at their church before the midday dinner, the cricket match and games of the afternoon, and the evening dance.—F. J. F.</NOTE1>  Accordingly, these Gilds were everywhere<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS152">The reason why there is no patron saint mentioned in the case of the Gild of the Smiths of Chesterfield (see Mr. Smith's collection, p. 168), seems to me to be that this Gild does not, in the account given of it, appear any more as an independent Gild, but simply as a subdivision of the Gild of the Holy Cross of the Merchants of Chesterfield.  Before it joined the latter, it had been likewise under the patronage of the Holy Cross, as is proved by the members "worshipping before the greater cross in the nave of the church of All Saints," and by the "lights to be burnt before the cross on the days named."  But after it had become a mere subdivision of a Gild under the same patronage, a special mention of the patron was no more required, and, for the sake of discriminating it from the rest, it was simply called the Gild of the Smiths.</NOTE1> under the patronage of the Holy Trinity, or of certain Saints, or of the Holy Cross, or of the Holy Sacrament, or of some other religious mystery.  In honour of these patrons they stuck candles on their altars and before their images; in some statutes this appears even as the only object of the Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS153">See, for instance, p. 14 of Mr. Smith's collection.</NOTE1>  Wilda<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS154">Wilda, p. 347.</NOTE1> narrates also how the setting up of such a candle became the origin of an entire Gild.  Once, towards the end of the fourteenth century, says he, several merchants and shopmen of Flensburg were sitting drinking together, and having paid their score, six shillings (standard of Lübeck) remained over.  What should be done with these, was now the question. At length they resolved to order a candle to be made, which was to burn before the image of the Virgin Mary on the altar of our Lady.  This fraternity, so insignificantly begun, increased rapidly <EPB/><PB N="lxxxiv"/>in members and in income; the Gild-brothers therefore resolved to adopt a regular constitution, to elect aldermen, to begin a Gild-book, &amp;c.  Besides for the setting-up of candles, the members united also for special devotions to their patrons; and amongst these Gilds must be named, above all, the fraternities of the Rosary, as those widest spread since the days of St. Dominic. Further, the Gilds got masses said in honour of their patrons, and went in solemn procession to their churches on the days of their feasts.  Conventions like that between the fraternity of London Sadlers, and the neighbouring Canons of St. Martin-le-Grand, by which the Sadlers were admitted into brotherhood and partnership of masses, orisons, and other good deeds, with the canons, were common with these religious Gilds.  They further obliged their members to engage in devotions and divine services for the souls of their departed brethren, and often, also, to aid pilgrims and pilgrimages,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS155">Mr. Ludlow's suggestion (<HI1 REND="i">Fortnightly Review,</HI1> vol. vi., N. S., p. 399), that the assistance of pilgrims "is probably the original of what is now termed 'donation' to 'travellers,' or 'tramps,' or sometimes simply 'tramp-money'—i.e. relief to members going in search of work," can hardly be serious.  Craftsmen travelling in search of work were at least not usual in England in the fourteenth century, and perhaps even never as long as the old system of industry prevailed; whilst a glance at some ordinances relating to the relief of pilgrims, even among the statutes of Craft-Gilds (such as, for instance, on pp. 180, 182 and others of Mr. Smith's collection) might convince Mr. Ludlow of the real nature of these pilgrims. (The 12 Richard II. cap. 3, requiring a Letter-Patent from wandering labourera, evidently refers to agricultural labourers only.)  See Additional Notes, No. 4.</NOTE1> especially to some most revered places, as, for instance, to the Holy Land, to the tombs of the apostles Peter and Paul, or of St. James (of Compostella), to Loretto and other places.</P><P>But, as Hincmar pointed out, the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"obsequium religionis"</FOREIGN> included not only devotions and orisons, but also every exercise of Christian charity, and thereſore, above all things, mutual assistance of the Gild-brothers in every exigency, especially in old age, in sickness, in cases of impoverishment,—if not brought on by their own folly,—and of wrongful imprisonment, in losses by fire, water, or shipwreck, aid by loans, provision of work, and, lastly, the burial of the dead.  It included, further, the assistance of the poor and sick, and the visitation and comfort of prisoners not belonging to the Gild.  And, as in the Middle Ages instruction and education were entirely supplied by the Church, and were considered a religious duty, we find among the objects of religious Gilds also the aid of poor scholars, the maintenance of schools, and the payment of schoolmasters.</P><P>No Gild pursued all these objects together; in each separate Gild one object or the other predominated, and, besides it, the Gild pursued several others.  But often, too, we find Gilds for the fulfilment of quite a concrete and merely local task, as, for <EPB/><PB N="lxxxv"/>instance, the Gild of Corpus Christi at York.  I am obliged on this account to make some observations against Mr. Toulmin Smith, though I do it with extreme unwillingness; for nobody can acknowledge Mr. Smith's great merits in making this collection with greater thanks than myself, and I am most keenly alive to the fact that it becomes me, least of all, to enter into controversy against a man of such learning, especially in this place.  But Mr. Smith has so strangely misconceived the character of this Gild,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS156">See pp. 140-143 of Mr. Smith's collection.</NOTE1> that I think it absolutely necessary to correct him.</P><P>The case with this York Gild is simply this.  In all Roman-Catholic countries the consecrated host is carried every year on the day of Corpus Christi, by the priest of highest rank in the place, in solemn procession, in the towns through the streets, and in the country over the fields.  This is one of the greatest feasts of the Roman-Catholic Church.  To heighten its solemnity, all the pomp which the Church can command is brought together. With this intention the clergy of York founded a special Gild, of which the sole object was to provide the ceremonies and pomp of this festival.  As the solemnities of one of the greatest ecclesiastical feasts were in question, it can easily be understood that those who were at the head of the Gild were priests.  Moreover, the reason why the many crafts of York joined so generally in this procession, was neither "the love of show and pageant which it gratified," nor was it "the departure from the narrow spirit of the original ordinances," but simply that the taking part in this procession was considered as a profession of faith in transubstantiation. I have myself seen at Munich, the King, the Ministers, the whole body of clergy, the University, all the Trades with their banners and emblems, all the Religious Fraternities, the Schools, and even the Army, taking part in a like procession; and that at Vienna is renowned for still greater pomp.</P><P>As there were Gilds for conducting this procession, so there were also Gilds for the representation of religious plays, which were common in the Middle Ages in all countries, and which are still performed in some places, for instance, every tenth year at Oberammergau in Southern Bavaria.  Such were the Gild of the Lord's Prayer at York, and the Gilds of St. Elene, of St. Mary, and of Corpus Christi, at Beverley.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS157">See also Blomefield's account of the Gild of the Holy Cross at Abingdon, in his <HI1 REND="i">History of Norſolk,</HI1> iii. p. 494.</NOTE1>  The performance of secular plays was also the object of some Gilds, for instance, of the Gild at Stamford,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS158">See p. 192 of Mr. Smith's collection.</NOTE1> and of the <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Confrérie des Conards</FOREIGN> at Rouen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS159">Ouin-Lacroix, p. 493.</NOTE1> <EPB/><PB N="lxxxvi"/>Moreover, all objects of common interest for which now-a-days special societies and associations provide, — for instance, the various insurance companies,—in the Middle Ages caused all who were interested in them to unite themselves to religious Gilds; the motive and the principles only were other than those of to-day, namely, Christian charity, instead of profit. Thus there were not only Gilds like the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Fraternitas ad Ædificandum Capellam St. Gertrudris,"</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS160">Wilda, p. 349.</NOTE1> but also those for the repair of bridges and highways.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS161">See p. 249 of Mr. Smith's collection.</NOTE1>  The National Life-Boat Institution of to-day would undoubtedly have been a Religious Gild in the Middle Ages; to be convinced of it one need only look at the statutes of the Gild of the Holy Trinity, Wygnale, Norfolk.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS162">See p. 110, ibid.</NOTE1>  Even at the present time I know of societies similar to these Gilds among the Catholics.  The Roman-Catholic Bishops of Germany founded, a few years ago, the association of St. Catherine all over Germany, with a great number of local branches, for the foundation of a Roman-Catholic University. Every member is bound to a minimum contribution and to certain devotions.  The Bishop of Hippo and Tagaste founded, especially in France, but with branches extending to other countries, an association under the same obligations for the erection of orphan-houses in Africa; and similar to these there exists still now an infinite number of associations in the Roman-Catholic Church.  Like these last-n med examples of to-day, the mediæval Gilds always connected special devotions and good deeds with the pursuit of their principal object.</P><P>When the Frith-Gilds originated, after the family had ceased to afford its members necessary protection, they also, as well as the Craft-Gilds in later times, connected with the pursuit of their political and industrial objects certain devotions and good deeds; and it has therefore been justly observed, "that it was not till the times subsequent to the Reformation that these fraternities could be regarded as strictly secular."  These religious provisions in all kinds of Gilds were probably the reason why Mr. Toulmin Smith has given the name of Social Gilds to those which provide for other common interests besides the political and industrial ones, instead of terming them "Religious Gilds," as was usual till now.  His name for them is undoubtedly a just one, but it comprehends the political and industrial Gilds as much as the one used hitherto; for the bases on which these Gilds rested were the same social principles as those by which the rest were guided.  It distinguishes the two kinds even less; for though there were religious provisions in the political and <EPB/><PB N="lxxxvii"/>industrial Gilds, yet these were always only of less importance, whilst the other Gilds pursued regularly as principal objects things, the provision for which was considered in the Middle Ages as an essential religious duty and task of the Church.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS163">As I discussed this subject a little with Mr. Toulmin Smith,—I think we settled the name together,—I may say that he looked at <HI1 REND="i">the main object</HI1> of the Gilds he was dealing with, those of A.D. 1389; and as that was unquestionably social, like that of our modern Benefit-Societies, he gave these Gilds their right name.  To have called them "Religious," because of their ornament of a saint's name, would have seemed to him and me a monstrous contradiction, in the days of Chaucer and Wycliffe, of William who had the Vision of Piers the Plowman, and others who have left us records of what Romanism, with its monks and friars, practically then was in England.—F. J. FURNIVALL.  See Additional Notes, No. 2.</NOTE1>Though I acknowledge the justness of Mr. Smith's appellation, I prefer the one which Madox uses, and which is also in use in all other countries.</P><P>People of all ranks took part in these Religious Gilds.  Now and then, however, people out of a certain class were not to be admitted.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS164">See p. 179 of Mr. Smith's collection.  See also Wilda, p. 361.</NOTE1>  The same person might take part in several religious Gilds.  The members had often a special livery, as is still now the case with some fraternities at Rome.  These liveries were worn on their ecclesiastical festivals, and probably also at the great feastings and drinking-bouts which were always connected with them.  Notwithstanding all the prohibitions against the latter, since the days of Hincmar, they seem to have so pushed themselves into the foreground, that sometimes special references were needed in the Gild statutes, that "not eating and drinking, but mutual assistance and justice were the principal objects of the Gild."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS165">See Wilda, p. 33.</NOTE1></P><P>The expenses to be defrayed for attaining the objects of the Gild were provided for by the entrance-fees, the contributions, the gifts and the legacies of members.  The contributions were sometimes fixed, but sometimes, especially in earlier times, they varied according to the wants of the Gild.  The account of the Gild of the Smiths at Chesterfield is the only one in which there are no contributions mentioned;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS166">p. 168 sqq. of Mr. Smith's collection.</NOTE1> it had its own property, from which all its expenses were to be defrayed; it had, however, to pay with bankruptcy for this deviation from Gild principles.  The organization of the Religious (or Social) Gilds was the same as that of all Gilds up to the time of our modern Trade-Unions: a meeting, and officers elected in it, with fines for not accepting office when chosen to it.  Often the members had, on their entrance, to declare by oath that they would fulfil their obligations. Persons of ill repute were not to be admitted; and members <EPB/><PB N="lxxxviii"/>were to be excluded for misconduct.  Moreover, the same rules are to be found with regard to proper behaviour and decent dress at the Gild-meetings, as recur in all kinds of Gilds to our day.  Disputes among members were to be decided by the Gild. The disclosing of the affairs of the Gild was to be severely punished.  In those places in which the Gild had no special hall, its meetings were often held in the Town-hall.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS167">See Wilda, p. 348.</NOTE1>  The fraternities must accordingly have enjoyed high consideration.</P><P>As to the Gilds among the clergy, the Capitularies of Hincmar—which, as said above, related to them<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS168"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Labbei Concilia,</FOREIGN> ed. Coleti, t. x. cap. 14, p. 4: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Quomodo in conviviis defunctorum, aliarumve collectarum gerere se debeant."</FOREIGN>  Cap. 15: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Quid cavendum sit presbyteris, quando per Kalendas inter se conveniunt."</FOREIGN></NOTE1>—contain ordinances against the extravagances of the priests at funeral meals, and at the feastings which used to follow their meetings, especially those of the priests of a deanery (or <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">diaconasia</FOREIGN>), on the first of each month.  No priest was to get drunk at them, nor was he to empty goblets to the health of saints or of the soul of the deceased; nor was he to force others to drink, nor get drunk himself at the desire of others.  The priests were not to burst out into indecent noise or roaring laughter; they were not to sing vain songs nor tell inane jokes; nor were they to allow scandalous performances of bears or female dancers to be made before them, nor delight in other mummeries, "because this was heathenish, and forbidden by Canon law."  Nor were they on every occasion to provoke each other, or anybody else, to passion and quarrels, and still less to fighting and murder; nor was he who was provoked to assail at once his provoker.  On the contrary, the priests were to breakfast with honesty and fear of God; holy stories and admonitions were to be read, and hymns sung, and every one was to go home in good time.  Exactly the same ordinances are contained in the Capitularies of Bishop Walter of Orleans,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS169">Ibid. cap. 17, p. 73: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Quomodo in consortiis et conviviis gerere se debeant."</FOREIGN></NOTE1> which likewise bear date in the year 858.</P><P>These passages do not, however, contain anything from which the existence of a Gild amongst these priests can be inferred; for the extravagances mentioned might be connected with any kind of meeting.  In later times, however, the clergymen assembled on the first day of each month to deliberate on their interests, were united in special fraternities, which, from their meeting-day on the Kalends of each month, were called <HI1 REND="i">"Gilds of the Kalenders."</HI1>  It is generally inferred from this, that probably even in Hincmar's time the priests bound each other by mutual agreement to pray for their salvation, and to observe certain <EPB/><PB N="lxxxix"/>rules with respect to their meetings; and these meetings are accordingly believed to have been Gild-meetings of the clergy. This is nothing but a mere conjecture, it is true.  But it is also true that, in later time, the members of the Gilds of the Kalenders used to assemble on the Kalends of each month for divine service, for deliberation on their interests, and for common meals, like the priests in the time of Hincmar.  In a deed of the fifteenth century they are still called <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"fratres in calendis missas celebrantes."</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS170">Wilda, p. 352.</NOTE1>  In any case, therefore, the name "Gilds of the Kalenders" seems to be derived from these monthly meetings.</P><P>In later times the objects of these Gilds were extended to the exercise of any good works, especially towards the Gild-brothers themselves,—as for instance, the distribution of loaves among them,—and also to the assistance of the poor, the furnishing of church-attire; and these Gilds, as is shown by the Statutes of the Gilds of the Kalenders at Bristol,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS171">See p. 287 of Mr. Smith's collection</NOTE1> employed themselves even in the keeping of old records, and in the maintenance of schools. Now and then the Statutes of these Gilds remind their members expressly, that their fraternity was crected <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"non solum pro commodis præsentibus, et lucris temporalibus inhiandis, sed magis pro beneficiis celestibus et perpetuis;"</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS172">Wilda, p. 356.</NOTE1> and especially with regard to the great feastings of these Gilds, such admonitions may not have been out of place.  Most of the Statutes of the Gilds of Kalenders have, for the regulation of their feasts, a special bill of fare, as an appendix.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS173">Ibid. p. 365.</NOTE1>  In some Gilds there were special stewards to provide for these meals, and then the expenses were defrayed by common contributions; in others, some of the brethren and sisters, each in their turn, had to prepare the meal from their own means.</P><P>These fraternities existed originally only among the clergy. In later times laymen too took part in them; and then the only distinction of these Gilds from the other religious fraternities was, that the clergy prevailed in them, whilst proportionally only few clergymen belonged to the others, and were even sometimes expressly excluded from all offices.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS174">See p. 264 of Mr. Smith's collection.</NOTE1>  The only account of a Gild of Kalenders contained in the present collection of Mr. Smith, that of the Gild of the Kalenders of Bristol, belongs to this later time.  Often the number of members was limited in these Gilds, sometimes to the number of the twelve apostles, sometimes to twenty-four.  In this case the number of lay members was always fixed in proportion to that of the clerical members. Thus the Gild of St. Canute at Flensburg consisted, <EPB/><PB N="xc"/>according to its Statutes from the year 1382, of twenty-four priests; but whenever this number could not be filled up, laymen might be admitted, but only to the number of eight, at the outside. The wives of laymen were, however, excluded from the meetings till the year 1422.  In this year, the Gild-book narrates, the ecclesiastical brothers were moved by the prayers of the lay brothers, repeated for several years, to grant the admission of their wives to the meals after the general meetings.  There was, however, to be one condition: the wife of the lay brother, whose turn it was, was obliged to provide the meal, and to wait at table.  The mayor and his wife were to have the first turn.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS175">Wilda, p. 359.</NOTE1></P><P>The laymen, however, always remained in a subordinate position. At the meals they had seats separate from those of the priests,—probably because the latter talked over their affairs at table,—and in the deliberations the laymen had no vote.  As among the other Religious Gilds, there were special ones for various classes and ranks, so there existed also Gilds for the higher and the lower clergy, the so-called Major and Minor Gilds of the Kalenders. One Gild of Kalenders existed in almost every town; in the larger towns even more.  The organization of the Gild of Kalenders was the same as in other Gilds.  Often the president was called Dean —perhaps a remnant of the origin of these Gilds.—Often, too, the Gilds of the Kalenders had halls like the other Gilds; and, as in the lay Gilds, the brothers of the ecclesiastical Gilds used to go there daily "to beer and to wine."</P><P>The Reformation shook the whole system of Gilds to its foundation; and this was especially the case with the Religious Gilds of the laity, and the Gilds of the Kalenders.  "In England," says Madox,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS176"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi,</FOREIGN> p. 27.</NOTE1> "these Religious Gilds have been judged to be founded in superstition;" and it was the same in all countries in which the Reformation gained ground.  The Gilds were therefore abolished in all Protestant countries; but not on the Continent as in England, in favour of the private purse of the King and his courtiers;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS177">By Act 37 Henry VIII. cap. 4, and Act 1 Edw. VI. cap. 14.  See Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith's Introduction, p. xlii.</NOTE1> on the contrary, we see in Northern Germany and in Denmark, the property and income of these Gilds delivered everywhere, according to the intention of the founders, to the common treasure for the poor, to poor-houses, hospitals, and schools.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS178">Wilda, pp. 372, 373.</NOTE1>  It is very interesting to see that the regular conventions of priests are found in Denmark even in the sixteenth century, after the introduction of the Reformation.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS179">Ibid. p. 353.</NOTE1>They were still called by the same name, "Gilds of the Kalenders," <EPB/><PB N="xci"/>though they were held no more every month, but only once (or several times) a year.  The synod at Rothschild ordered, that they should also take place in those provostships in which they had not existed till then, that the ministers might remain united in doctrine and ceremony.  Nobody was, however, to be burdened with the preparation of a meal; and no stranger to the place, and no foreigner, was to be admitted a member of the Gild.  The conclusion of another synod says:  "When a priest goes to the meeting, he shall not be armed.  During dinner they shall abstain from scandalous talk, drunkenness, and unseemly disputes; four dishes and no more are to be served; and towards evening everybody is to go home."  A former synod, of the year 1562, had already forbidden the abuse of prolonging these conventions for two or three days.  Pontoppidan<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS180">Pontoppidan, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Ann. Eccl. Dan.</FOREIGN> iii. p. 47.</NOTE1> describes these conventions as they took place in the age after the Reformation, as follows: "The priests, together with their wives, heard a sermon in the church of the brother whose turn it was; they then proceeded round the altar, deposited there an offering on behalf of the poor scholars of the next town; the conclusions and proceedings of the foregoing provincial synod were then recited, and their other affairs talked over and put in order.  After this they, together with their whole families, went to the parsonage, where they indulged a little at dinner, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">'in bona charitate'</FOREIGN> sang certain songs at meals, and made themselves merry in other wise; but sometimes quarrelled also scandalously, and made a great uproar." The resemblance of the synodal precepts mentioned above on this page to those which Hincmar of Rheims gave earlier in the ninth century to the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"presbyteris, qui per calendas conveniunt"</FOREIGN> is striking.  It shows clearly that after so many centuries these meetings were still held in the same way, and that the same abuses<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS181">In the year 1598, a parson at Ewerdrup had to prepare the meal at the meeting of the Kalenders.  What was wasted there is to be found minutely in Pontoppidan, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Ann. Eccl.</FOREIGN> ii. p. 47.  There were consumed, among other things, one head of cattle (at the price of 18 marks), six lambs (12 marks), two fat swine (20 marks), seven geese (7 marks), ten pairs of fowls (3 marks 12 shillings), three tuns of beer of Rostock (33 marks), and two tuns of homebrewed beer (10 marks).

THE GILD-MERCHANTS.</HEAD><P>THOSE sworn fraternities for the protection of right, and the preservation of liberty, of which mention has already been made in Part I., arose independently of the towns.  Yet in the towns, the necessity of protecting liberty, property, and trade, against the violence of neighbouring nobles, the arbitrary aggressions of the bishops or the burgrave, or the bold onsets of robbers, or—as in the case of towns which sprang from the settlements of traders in foreign countries—against the onslaughts of the surrounding and often still barbarian inhabitants, —often too the feeling of insecurity within the towns themselves,—must have specially moved the small freemen to the formation of the societies above referred to.  These inhabitants of the towns were old free landed proprietors; partly of the neighbouring estates, but chiefly of land within the territory of the towns themselves.  Most of them carried on trade; some probably also handicrafts.  But the possession of town-land is the distinguishing mark of these earliest burghers.  To this possession alone was full citizenship everywhere attached in the first movements of civic life.  Hence, whilst the dangers just mentioned as threatening liberty and property made it necessary to provide means of protection, and whilst the possession of soil in the same small territory—indeed, within the walls of the same town,—together with the similarity of occupations, increased the community of interests, close vicinity of residence made easy the conclusion of alliances.  Naturally therefore, the whole body of full citizens, that is, of the possessors of portions of the town-lands of a certain value, the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"civitas,"</FOREIGN> united itself everywhere into one Gild, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"convivium conjuratum;"</FOREIGN> the citizens and the Gild became identical; and what was Gild-law became the law of the town.</P><P>Such Gilds existed in England even in Anglo-Saxon times, as the formerly-mentioned Gilds of Dover, of the Thanes at Canterbury, as well as perhaps the Gild-Merchant at London,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS185">Wilda, p. 244; <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, p. 26.</NOTE1> together<EPB/><PB N="xciv"/> with many others, of which only later accounts are extant. Such also were the Gild-Merchant of York,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS186">Wilda, p. 250.</NOTE1> the great Gild of St. John at Beverley, of the Hanshouse of Beverley, as well as that of the Blessed Mary of Chesterfield, though these were of a somewhat later period.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS187"><HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1>, pp. 151 and 165.  (By the quotation <HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1> is always meant the Statutes contained in Mr. Toulmin Smith's collection.)</NOTE1>  The Old Usages of Winchester, too, contain many intimations of a former relationship of this kind between the Gild of Merchants there and the whole body of the citizens;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS188">Cf. <HI1 REND="i">ibid.</HI1> p. 357.  The Usages date from a time in which the commonalty of Winchester enjoyed already a share in the government of the town.  Yet the members of the old Gild of Merchants appear still as its governors; it is from amongst them ("the meste gode men,"—an expression which occurs frequently also in Germany and Belgium for the patrician families) that the Council of the Mayor, and the twenty-four sworn men, are taken; and these exercise a vast influence at the election of the Mayor, and on other occasions.  (Cf. <HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1>, p. 349.)</NOTE1> and the same is true of the Ordinances of Worcester.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS189">English Gilds, p. 369.</NOTE1>One of the documents relating to these Gilds contained in this volume, contains the grants of liberties, and of a Gild, to the townsmen of Beverley, similar to the grant of civic constitutions to several German towns,—as, for example to Lübeck, according to the municipal laws of Soest, to Freiburg according to those of Cologne,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS190">Cf. Wilda, p. 221, &amp;c., and p. 231, &amp;c.</NOTE1>—and to the grant of communal rights to the people of Rheims, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"ad modum communiœ Laudunensis"</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS191">Raynouard, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Histoire du Droit Municipal en France</FOREIGN>, tom. ii. livre iv. ch. i. ò 10 (Paris, 1829).</NOTE1>(Laon), by Louis VII. of France.  By this document, on p. 151 below, Thurstan, Archbishop of York, grants to the townsmen of Beverley, a Gild, and "all liberties, with the same laws that the men of York have in their city."  King Henry I., as well as Thurstan's successors, confirmed this Beverley grant; and there is even a document, stating its confirmation by Pope Lucius III.  From this kind of Gild sprang, in England, the method of recognizing the citizens as an independent body, by confirming their Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS192">Madox, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, p. 27: "Peradventure, from these Secular Gilds, or in imitation of them, sprang the method or practice of gildating and embodying whole towns."</NOTE1></P><P>The same relationship between the Gild and the town community existed in France.

In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, especially in the North of France, appear unions of the free <EPB/><PB N="xcv"/>townsmen, in order to protect themselves against the oppressions of the powerful, and the better to defend their rights.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS194">See the account of the grounds of ratification in the Charters of the French Kings.  Raynouard, tom. ii. livre iv. ch. 7.</NOTE1>  So, in 1070, the citizens of Mans established a sworn confederacy, which they called <HI1 REND="i">commune</HI1>,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS195">In Belgium and Germany it was only the unions of the lower classes which were called communes.</NOTE1> in order to oppose the oppressions of Godfrey of Mayenne.  The people of Cambrai did the same against their bishop in 1076, during his absence; and as he, on his return, refused to recognize their confederacy, they shut the gates of the town against him.  An affair of the same kind had taken place there already in 957.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS196">Cf. Moke, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Mœurs, Usages, Fêtes et Solennités des Belges</FOREIGN>, Bruxelles, ii. p. 6.</NOTE1>  These instances might be multiplied.  The numerous grants of communal rights to French towns from the eleventh to the thirteenth century, are nothing but the recognition by the king of such Frith-Gilds as had been previously in existence for a longer or shorter period.  Kings, even when they did not favour Gilds upon their own demesnes, generally did so upon those of the nobility, whose power they wished to break.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS197">Raynouard, tom. ii. livre iv. ch. 7, 8; Wilda, p. 152.</NOTE1>  But everywhere then, as in later times upon the formation of trade-unions, many transitory confederations, many unsuccessful attempts, and a great expenditure of courage, magnanimity and energy, preceded the permanent establishment of the communes.</P><P>Thus, in 1188, Count Philip of Flanders confirmed to the town of Aire in Artois, its laws and customs, such as his predecessors had already granted and recognized to the citizens, in order to secure them from the attacks of "wicked men."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS198">D'Achery, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Spicilegium</FOREIGN> (ed.

These customs were those of the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Amicitia</FOREIGN>, the Gild of citizens, which had been established by them probably even before the time of their first recognition, for protection against attacks from without, and for securing peace within.  What the Amicitia was for Aire, the so-called <FOREIGN>Vroedscapen</FOREIGN> were for the towns of the Netherlands,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS199">Wilda, p. 151.</NOTE1> the <FOREIGN>Hezlagh</FOREIGN> for Sleswig,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS200">Ibid. pp. 77, 152-158.</NOTE1> and apparently the <HI1 REND="i">St. Canute-Gild</HI1> for Flensburg.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS201">Ibid. p. 158, &amp;c.</NOTE1>  There are hardly any records bearing reference to Gilds in Germany in the tenth and eleventh centuries; probably because they had disappeared from public notice in consequence of the measures taken against them by princes and bishops; yet the relations existing at a later period between the "highest Gild" and the town, leaves no doubt that <EPB/><PB N="xcvi"/>here too the Gild was the germ of the town-constitutions.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS202">Wilda, p. 170.

Magnus, the son of King Nicholas of Denmark, had slain the Duke Canute Lavard, the Alderman and protector of the Sleswig Gild.  When King Nicholas, in 1130, came to Hetheby (that is, Sleswig), his followers advised him (as an old Danish chronicle relates) not to enter the town, for the townsmen put in force the law with extreme severity within their Gild, called Hezlagh, and did not suffer any one to remain unpunished who had killed or even injured one of their brethren.  But the king despised the warning, saying, "What should I fear from these tanners (pelipers) and shoemakers?"  Scarcely, however, had he entered the town, when the gates were closed, and at the sound of the Gild-bell the citizens mustered, seized upon the king, and killed him, with all who tried to defend him.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS206">Wilda, p. 71.</NOTE1>  Thus, even at the beginning of the twelfth century, the Gilds enjoyed in Denmark such respect, that the lord of the land, Duke Canute, was pleased to become their Alderman: and they had such power that they could venture to revenge, even upon a king, any violation of the law committed on a member of their great family.</P><P>The Sleswig Gild was called <FOREIGN>Hezlagh</FOREIGN>, that is, either sworn Gild, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">convivium conjuralum</FOREIGN>, or highest Gild, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">summum convivium</FOREIGN>.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS207">Ibid. p. 72.</NOTE1>  If the latter, other Gilds must have existed besides it.  Although the body of citizens and the Gild originally included the same persons, yet the quality of being a full-citizen did not of itself include the fellowship of the Sworn-Gild; for this a special acceptance was required.  Now, as the towns flourished and increased in well-being, material differences in property must have arisen among the full-citizens — partly through the failure of individuals in the race for wealth, partly through the settlement of new poor families in the town—which could not but have a lowering effect on their occupations.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS208">Arnold, ii. p. 208; Moke, i. p. 179, ii. 107.</NOTE1>  This led to <EPB/><PB N="xcvii"/>closing the old Gild which hitherto had existed alone in a town; by the side of which others then formed themselves with the same or similar ends.  But the oldest Gild maintained a very natural precedence over the others, and was even called the "higher" or "highest<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS209">Wilda, p. 170, quotes the Statutes of Dortmund: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Si vero percussor est confrater maioris gylde nostrœ amam vini superaddat burgensibus pro emenda."</FOREIGN>The members of the highest Gild enjoyed also the privilege of a less number of sworn brethren being required.  Cf. Wilda, pp. 75-86.</NOTE1> Gild."  Gradually, some system of hereditary transmission of the freedom of the Gild came into existence <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">de facto</FOREIGN>, in that the son generally entered the fraternity to which his father belonged: the sons of Gild-brothers were naturally more willingly accepted than other new members, and, later on, the conditions of entry were rendered more easy for them.  Thus originated a certain circle of families which from generation to generation belonged to the highest Gild, and continuously constituted its stock.  The oldest Gild remained no longer equivalent to the whole body of citizens; the Full-burghers Gild became the Old-burghers Gild, and according to place and time its development became more or less aristocratic.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS210">Cf. Wilda, pp. 77, 78; Arnold, vol. i. p. 246.</NOTE1></P><P>In Sleswig, when King Nicholas was slain there in 1130, the Gild still included the whole body of the citizens.  The Chronicle at least speaks of the citizens in general, who mustered at the call of the Gild-bell (the town-bell).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS211">Wilda, p. 77.</NOTE1>  On the other hand, in Germany, at a somewhat later period, the government of the town is everywhere found in the hands of a "highest Gild."  In Cologne the <FOREIGN>Richerzechheit</FOREIGN>, or Gild of the rich, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">summum convivium</FOREIGN>, occupied the municipal offices.  In the eleventh century, during the struggle of the Cologne people against their bishop, Hanno, there was still only one Gild, which included the whole of the citizens:—at least, there is no mention of patrician families.  But by the end of the twelfth century this Gild had become a <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">summum convivium</FOREIGN>.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS212">See also Arnold, vol. i. p. 401 &amp;c.</NOTE1>  The government of the town rested exclusively with a "patrician-aristocracy," the <FOREIGN>Richerzechheit</FOREIGN>, which had already grown insolent, exercised an oppressive sway, and looked upon power as a lucrative monopoly.  This led, in the thirteenth century, to violent revolts of the craftsmen, particularly the weavers, who were especially thriving there.  They were no longer willing to bear alone the burdens of the Commonwealth, but desired a share in the administration, at least in what concerned the management of the city household, and especially as the "Old-burghers" contributed least to the payment of the taxes.  Several times, indeed, we see the weavers allied with the bishops of Cologne against the <EPB/><PB N="xcviii"/>ruling families.  The like often happened in those days—as for example, at Liège, Huy, and Bâle—and also in the earlier alliances of the French communes with the kings against the nobility, as well as in the modern alliances between the working-classes and Tories, or Cæsars.  But the men of Cologne did not succeed in their object, in the overthrow of the patricians, until the second half of the fourteenth century.  Contemporary with the <FOREIGN>Richerzechheit</FOREIGN>there existed in the town other Gilds of merchants; but information as to their participation in the government of the town is wanting.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS213">Wilda, pp. 176-194, 235 &amp;c. 257 &amp;c.; Arnold, vol. i. pp. 418, 419, 425, 433.</NOTE1> Traces of the same or some similar development are to be found in Spire, Strasburg, Frankfort-on-Main, as well as in Freiburg and Lübeck, and in several other towns.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS214">Wilda, pp. 194-228, 231.</NOTE1>  The frequently recurring repetitions, by the town-hating Hohenstauffen, of Charlemagne's prohibition of conjurations (societies bound by mutual oaths), are shown by this to have been nothing but abortive attempts to annihilate the Gilds, whose existence was peremptorily required by the circumstances of the time.  These prohibitions however affected the highest Gilds less than the others; at least, Frederick II.'s prohibition of the Gilds of Goslar in A.D. 1219, specially excepts the Gild of Coiners,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS215">Wilda, p. 169.</NOTE1> which in the free towns was regularly identical with the highest Gild, as in Cologne, Spire,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS216">Ibid. p. 195.</NOTE1> and other places.</P><P>In England, where the Gilds were far in advance of those of any other country, there were highest Gilds of the kind described, even in Anglo-Saxon times.  There, according to Lappenberg,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS217">Lappenberg, vol. i. pp. 610-612.</NOTE1> the landed proprietors on or near whose estates the towns were built, for a long time exercised great influence in them, and constituted their aristocracy.  Thus, in Canterbury, the condition of becoming an alderman was the possession of an alienable estate (<FOREIGN LANG="OE">soca</FOREIGN>), the possessors of which were united with other landed proprietors to the there-existing old Gild of the Thanes.  But as there were at Canterbury two other Gilds besides, this Gild of the Thanes was probably the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">summum convivium</FOREIGN>of that city6.</P><P>With a much higher degree of development we have however to deal, as I believe, in the before mentioned union of the Frith-Gilds of London, the like of which recurs at a later period at Berwick-upon-Tweed, and in a less degree of perfection in the German towns.  The fact of London preceding other places in this development, presents no difficulty, since England must be regarded as the birthplace of Gilds,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS218">See Additional Notes, No. 1.</NOTE1> and London perhaps as their <EPB/><PB N="xcix"/>cradle.  At least there is documentary evidence that the constitution of the City was based upon a Gild; and it served as a model for other English towns.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS219">Wilda, p. 248.  See also Hüllman, <FOREIGN>Städtewesen</FOREIGN>, vol. iii. p. 73.</NOTE1>  According to the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Judicia Civitatis Lundoniœ</FOREIGN> of the time of King Athelstan, the Frith-Gilds of London united to form one Gild that they might carry out their aims the more vigorously.  This united Gild governed the town; as is proved by the fact that their regulations bound even non-members.  The occasion of this union was, perhaps, that here, as afterwards in other places, other Gilds had gradually formed by the side of the original sole Gild, and rivalries between the old and the new prejudiced the attainment of the aim of the Gilds—the protection of freedom and of right.  Possibly the English <HI1 REND="i">Knighten Gild</HI1> was this original one.  According to Madox,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS220"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, p. 30.</NOTE1> the alderman of the Knighten Gild was the alderman of the Merchant Gild of the City.  Nor is our conjecture contradicted by Stow's statement<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS221">Stow's <HI1 REND="i">Survey of London</HI1> (ed. 1720), bk. ii. p. 3 &amp;c.</NOTE1> as to the date of the origin of this Gild; for this was probably only a sanction for the Gild's possession of landed property which it had received from King Edgar.  It would not of course require royal permission to come into existence.  The Knighten Gild had possession and jurisdiction both within and without the City, and its lands afterwards formed a quarter of London, whose name "Portsoken" shows also that it was formed from a territory situated originally without the city gates.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS222">Lappenberg, vol. i. p. 614; cf. also Wilda, p. 247.</NOTE1>  It was thus probably a Gild like that of the Thanes of Canterbury.</P><P>A similar union took place three centuries later at Berwick-upon-Tweed. In the years 1283 and 1284 the townsmen of Berwick agreed upon the statutes<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS223"><HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1>, p. 338, &amp;c.</NOTE1> of a single united Gild: "that where many bodies are found side by side in one place, they may become one, and have one will, and, in the dealings of one toward another, have a strong and hearty love."  Article I. therefore provides that "all separate Gilds heretofore existing in the borough shall be brought to an end," and that "no other Gild shall be allowed in the borough."  All formerly existing Gilds were to hand over to this one Gild the goods rightfully belonging to them, and "all shall be as members having one head; one in counsel, one body strong and friendly."  The way in which this statute was drawn up shows clearly that "citizen" and "Gild-brother" were considered identical.  It also contains a series of regulations concerning the administration of the <EPB/><PB N="c"/>town, the police of the markets, and various other points of municipal interest.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS224">Articles 2, 15, 16, 19 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, also 30; further 33, 34, 35, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46.  <HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1>, p. 338, &amp;c.</NOTE1>  The words of the preamble and of the first article show that, before the union of the various Gilds, rivalries detrimental to the body of the citizens had sprung up.  The succeeding articles make it clear that only the better inhabitants, the merchants, were Gild-brethren and citizens:<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS225">Articles 18, 25 (as to the last see p. cvii), 20, 21, 30, and others.</NOTE1> and several of the articles point out that at least one of the consolidated Gilds had been a Frith-Gild,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS226">Articles 12, 13, 31, 32.</NOTE1> which originally coincided with the whole body of citizens.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS227">Cf. Article 14.</NOTE1>  It may be that this first Gild included —as was the case in Canterbury—the old families, the original possessors of the soil in and around the town, who either then or afterwards carried on trade; or that it acquired with the growth of the town an aristocratic family character, as was the case in many German towns; or that it limited, for other reasons, the number of its members.  Then new Gilds arose, whose members were but little, or not at all, behind those of the first, either in rank, social consideration, or wealth, and who therefore strove for an equal share in the government of the town.  This led, in Berwick, to the above-noticed amalgamation of the Gilds, and in the German cities to a participation in the Town-Councils.  Thus it was with Spire and Frankfort; thus also with Lübeck and Strasburg, and probably also with Cologne.  In London this process was going on perhaps as early as the tenth century.  The admission of these new Gilds formed the transition from the Gild constitution of the town to that of the "commune," which was often further developed under violent storms, when the patricians withstood the ever-increasing struggles for power of those inhabitants who were excluded from political rights.  The history of the German and Belgian towns furnishes abundant proof of this being the case.</P><P>A peculiar union of Gilds must be inferred from an article in the Gild-Statutes of Malmoe in Denmark.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS228">Wilda, p. 100: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Qui vero in aliquo convivio contumax inventus fuerit vel satisfacere noluerit, si legitime citatus fuerit ad synodum generalem in Skanör, si ibidem respondere contemserit, ex tunc a dicto convivio excludatur."</FOREIGN>  The drawing-up of this statute took place towards the end of the thirteenth century.  See Wilda, p. 115.</NOTE1>  According to this article a confederation existed among the Gilds of various places, and had general assemblies of the Gild-brothers at Skanör. Perhaps its condition was analogous to that of the Flemish Hanse, or of the confederacies of the German towns, or of Edinburgh, Stirling, Berwick, and Roxburgh, united to a general <EPB/><PB N="ci"/>Scottish Trade-Gild.  It reminds one also strongly of the organization of the English Trade-Unions at the time of their change from local into national societies, when they united a great number of towns all over the country.</P><P>It may not be out of place here to dwell for a moment on the confederations among the German towns in the thirteenth century which I have just mentioned.  They, too, originated from circumstances similar to those which called forth the first Frith-Gilds; they were emanations from the same spirit, were founded on the same principles, and had rules similar to theirs; they were Gilds with corporations as members.  The most important among these unions was that of the Rhenish towns.  At the time of the interregnum, that is, at the very moment when Germany was left utterly without a ruler, when there was no power to check the princes in the unlimited extension of their rights, when they levied tolls at their pleasure, and ground the poor to the bone by exorbitant taxes; when knights and nobles lived by highway robbery, waylaid streets and passes, and plundered and murdered the merchants; when the strong oppressed the weak, unpunished, and might was right;—in that classical age of clublaw, when there was no supreme power in the empire, the union of the Rhenish towns stept for a time into its place.  This union was no mere offensive and defensive alliance; its object was the maintenance of an entire system of order and law, and of the authority of the Empire.  It forced even princes and nobles to join it. Like the Gild-brothers of Cambridge, the towns entered upon mutual obligations by oath; and the measures which they adopted for the protection of their members, and for the chastisement of the breakers of their peace, were similar to the Cambridge ones. A special clause insured common protection to the poor and little as well as to the mighty and great, whether they were lay or cleric, Christian or Jew.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS229">See Arnold, vol. ii. p. 66 sqq.; Barthold, <FOREIGN>Geschichte der deutschen Städte und des deutschen Bürgerthums</FOREIGN>, vol. ii. p. 200 sqq.  Leipzig, 1850.</NOTE1></P><P>A short examination of the Statutes of the Town-Gilds will justify our claim for these confederations of towns to be shoots from the same root, fruits from the same tree, and higher stages of the same development from which the Frith-Gilds sprang. From the time when these Frith-Gilds stood at the head of the towns, their Statutes show, without a particle of change, the essential nature of the Gilds as disclosed by the Gild-Statutes of Cambridge.  These Gilds appear as an enlarged great family, whose object is to afford such assistance to their members in all circumstances of life as one brother might expect from another, <EPB/><PB N="cii"/>and consequently, above all things, protection against the unbridled arbitrariness of the mighty, whether exercised by violence, or attempted at law by means of numerous friends as compurgators. The Gilds do not appear however as associations for instituting a <HI1 REND="i">new</HI1> law, but for maintaining the laws already existing, for supplementing a system of order as yet defective and only in course of development, and for guarding in common against the dangers attending a weak government.</P><P>The most detail-giving Statutes of Frith-Gilds which any country can show, are the Danish.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS230">Gilds had probably been transplanted from England to Denmark under King Canute, about the middle of the eleventh century.  They soon placed themselves under the special patronage of the three royal saints of the land, St. Canute the King, St. Canute the Duke, and St. Erich the King, and were called after them St. Canute's Gilds and St. Erich's Gilds.  From that time the government got-up relations with them, and favoured them as associations for the maintenance of law, security, and order.</NOTE1>  The following statements<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS231">Compare especially Wilda. pp. 116-144, and the Gild-Statutes contained in this volume.</NOTE1>rest mainly on their Ordinances:—</P><P>If a Gild-brother has been slain by a stranger, the Gild appears as an ally of his relations for taking revenge, or for obtaining the <FOREIGN LANG="OE">wergild</FOREIGN> or blood money.  But if a Gild-brother has slain a stranger, the Gild assists him in the atonement he must make for the manslaughter, by means of the wergild; or in his escape, if he has been outlawed for the crime.  Even if one Gild-brother kills another, the case is chiefly considered as a matter for the family of the slain; and, having made atonement to it, the culprit may remain a member of the fraternity.  Only in the case of malicious and wilful murder was he expelled as a worthless man (<FOREIGN LANG="OE">niding</FOREIGN>), and left to the mercy (that is, vengeance) of his victim's family.  The Gild-brothers also rendered each other such assistance as was sanctioned by the laws and customs of the time, in prosecuting and supporting their rights in courts of law.  But it was everywhere the first principle of the Gild to assist him only who had justice on his side.  How strictly this principle was observed may be inferred from the universal esteem enjoyed by the Gild-brothers, so that their evidence was considered specially credible; and wherever twelve persons were required as jurors or compurgators, half the number of Gild-brothers, or even less, were deemed sufficient.</P><P>To maintain and carry out their Ordinances, the Gild required a special jurisdiction; and, in consequence of the necessary distrust by the citizens of that time of the tribunals of their masters, it was natural that quarrels of all kinds which arose between members after their admission were brought within the reach of the <EPB/><PB N="ciii"/>Gild.  Quarrels among members only came, as a rule, within the jurisdiction of the association; and it was only in consequence of the peculiar relation of some Gilds to the town that disputes between non-members had also to submit to the Gild.  The limits of this jurisdiction varied according to time and place; but it was everywhere the rule that Gild-brothers, before going into the law-court, had to bring their case before the Gild for the sake of attempting, at least, reconciliation between them.  But the Gild never assumed a right over the life and limbs of its members; compensation only, and fines, were used for punishments, the highest penalty being expulsion.</P><P>The same regulations as the Religious Gilds had with regard to helping Gild-brothers in every need, are to be found in the Frith-Gilds.  On this point the Statutes of the Gilds of all countries are almost identical.  If a brother falls into poverty, if he incurs losses by fire or shipwreck, if illness or mutilation renders him unable to work, the brothers contribute to his assisttance. If a brother finds another in danger of life on sea or in captivity, he is bound to rescue him, even at the sacrifice of a part of his own goods; for which, however, he receives compensation from the brother assisted, or from the community.  English Gild-Statutes frequently mention loans to be given to brothers carrying on trade, often with no other condition than the repayment of it when he should no longer need it.  The sick brother found in his Gild aid and attendance; the dead was buried;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS232">See also especially Moke, vol. ii. p. 92.</NOTE1> for his soul prayers were offered, and services performed; and not unfrequently the Gild gave a dowry to his poor orphan daughter.  The numerous provisions as to the poor, as to pilgrims, and other helpless people, in the Statutes of English Gilds, prove that non-members in want found help from them as well.</P><P>The regulations as to the payment of chaplains of the Gild, as to common service and prayers, as well as to common feastings, were equally general: and everywhere fines recur equally for the infringement of the agreed-to Ordinances, for unseemly behaviour, and for offending of members.</P><P>There was an alderman at the head of the Gild, and often stewards by his side as assistants.  Other officials are also now and then to be met with.  The reception of a member depended upon the whole association.  If any one living in the country, or a foreigner, wished to become a member of the Gild, a citizen had to pledge himself for his honour.  In an association so closely united, the honour of every single member was to a certain extent the honour of the whole body.  Pure life and spotless <EPB/><PB N="civ"/>reputation<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS233">A passage not yet sufficiently explained in the Sleswig Town-Statutes (Wilda, p. 83), appears to me to find its explanation from this fact.  According to this passage, the Gild-brothers needed a less number of compurgators than a non-member of the Gild.  If the latter was not married, however, he enjoyed the same privilege as a Gild-brother.  But if he married, and was not a member of the Gild, he required the double number.  People have justly sought for a special explanation of this Ordinance, by which the married was placed in a worse position than the unmarried.  Now at that time the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">civitas</FOREIGN> and the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">convivium conjuratum</FOREIGN>were identical, it is true; nevertheless, the quality of a full-citizen did not give by itself the freedom of the Gild.  A special admission was required.  But every married full-citizen of unstained reputation was doubtless a member of the Gild; and if he were not, it was a sign that some stain on his honour excluded him, which justified in itself the requirement of a greater number of compurgators. But as long as a man was not married, he was not considered an adult; he could not therefore require to be a member of the Gild, and no one could wish to subject him to disadvantages at law for the simple reason that he was young.  Compare also the regulations at Hamburg, Wilda, p. 268.</NOTE1> must thereſore appear as <HI1 REND="i">the</HI1> condition of Gildfreedom. Besides this, the Gild-Statutes demand no other condition for admission.  Everybody entering the Gild had to bind himself by oath to keep the Gild-Statutes.</P><P>Women also might become members of the Gild.  They were, however, generally the wives or daughters of Gild-brothers.  It is only an exception when in several of the Gilds women became free of the Gild in their own right.  They, however, shared only in the advantages and burdens of the Gild, and never took part in its administration or its councils.</P><P>Many of the towns whose government was in the hands of such Gilds, especially those accessible by the sea, had been founded by merchants.  Like the modern so-called "factories" in Asia and Africa, the old merchants fortified places from which they carried on trade with the surrounding people.  But in all other towns also the great majority of the more respectable burghers lived by trade.  "When the Normans approached the harbour of Tiel," says a writer of the eleventh century, "the population living on the Wahal fled, leaving behind all its goods, money excepted: for it consisted of merchants."  He speaks besides of their common feastings, and says that they did not pronounce sentence according to the law of the land, but according to their own will, maintaining that the Emperor had granted and confirmed to them this right by charter.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS234">Moke, vol. i. pp. 118, 120, 192.</NOTE1>  It is therefore evident that a Gild of merchants existed there, who governed the town.  The excellent market of Antwerp is mentioned as early as 837, in which year the Normans put it to the flames; Gant (Ghent) is described as flourishing by trade and fishing; and the same may be said of a number of other Belgian and French towns.  The magistrates of Paris are said to have been called <EPB/><PB N="cv"/><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">nautæ</FOREIGN> in the times of the Romans;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS235">Moke, vol. i. pp. 114-123.</NOTE1> and in deeds of the twelfth century the words <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">burgenses</FOREIGN> and <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">mercatores</FOREIGN>, or <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">mercatores per aquam</FOREIGN>, are used as synonymous.  The corporation of the Paris merchants stood at the head of the town.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS236">Raynouard, tom. ii. livre iv. ch. i. ò 9.</NOTE1>  It was the same with the towns in Germany.  Of the foundation of Freiburg in Brisgau we are told, that when Berthold of Zähringen intended to found a free city, with the same liberties and laws as the men of Cologne had in their city, he first assembled a number of respected merchants, to whom he allotted ground for the building of houses on the place destined as the market-place. From their number he took also the consuls of the town. Lübeck was founded likewise on the basis of a free merchant community.  And as it was in these towns, so it was in their prototypes.  At Cologne, in the eleventh century, the terms "burghers" and "merchants" are alternately used as synonymous. At Spire the patrician ſamilies of the town, from whose ranks the council was taken, carried on trade.  In like manner the leading families of Ratisbon consisted of merchants.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS237">Wilda, pp. 231, 233, 236, 260, and 235.</NOTE1>  As to Denmark, the Danish word for town—<FOREIGN>Kiöbsted</FOREIGN> (bargain-place)—sufficiently denotes its character.  In London also the Gild which was the base of its constitution, may have consisted chiefly of merchants. Wilda<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS238">Ibid. p. 249; see also Madox, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, p. 26.</NOTE1> alleges, in proof of this conjecture, the early importance of London trade; the ordinance in the above mentioned <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">judicia</FOREIGN>, that every merchant having made three long sea-voyages on his own account was to have the rank of a Thane; and lastly, the report, that in a national assembly at Oxford in the year 1036, the shipowners, as the most important burghers of London, were delegated to elect King Hardicanute.  There is no doubt as to the mercantile character of the later Town-Gilds in England; they are even called there <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">gildæ mercatoriæ</FOREIGN>;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS239">One of these <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">gildœ mercatoriœ</FOREIGN> certainly existed at York in the time of Henry I. At this date the Gild at Beverley was constituted after its model.  (See p. 151 of Mr. Smith's collection.) It became the general rule to confirm the Gild of a town by granting it all the liberties which another town already enjoyed.  Wilda (p. 251) quotes from Madox, as towns which had received this confirmation under Henry II., Winchester, Shrewsbury, Andover, Southampton, Wallingford; under Richard I., Gloucester; under King John, Helleston and Dunwich; under Henry III., Hereford.  Into the reign of the latter king falls also the rise of the Gild at Chesterfield. (See p. 165 of Mr. Smith's collection.) If the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">gilda mercatoria</FOREIGN> at Coventry (p. 226 of Mr. Smith's collection) was really a Town-Gild, its rise must belong to a much earlier time than its confirmation by Edward III. in 1340.  Perhaps this confirmation was only a repetition of the sanction of the corporate rights, which might appear desirable to the merchants of Coventry, the better to protect their commerce, which, according to their complaints, suffered from their great distance from the sea.  Besides, the Gild. as Mr. Toulmin Smith justly remarks, might be erected without confirmation.  At all events, the fourteenth century was no longer the time in which, on the foundation of Gild-Merchants, town-constitutions were formed.  Moreover, earlier Gilds existed at Coventry; and the statutes contain nothing which characterizes the Gild as a Town-Gild.  Perhaps also this Gild was nothing but a union for mere trade purposes.  The Gild of the Holy Cross at Birmingham of the year 1392 was no <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">gilda mercatoria</FOREIGN>, but appears much more like a Religious Gild.  (See p. 239 of Mr. Smith's collection.)</NOTE1> and the <EPB/><PB N="cvi"/>words by which the king confirms their Gild to the burghers of a town, are often <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"quod habeant gildam mercatoriam."</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS240">Madox, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, pp. 27, 132; Hist. of the Exch. vol. i. p. 412.</NOTE1>  In Scotland too the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">gildæ mercatoriæ</FOREIGN> stood at the head of the towns.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS241">Herbert, Hist. of the Twelve Great Livery Companies of London, 1837, vol. i. p. 22.</NOTE1></P><P>Security from external dangers, and the maintenance of peace in the interior of their towns, had been the original motives of the burghers in uniting themselves into these Gilds.  But as almost all Gild-brothers carried on trade, the once existing organization was soon used for the furthering of the common trade interests; for it was in the nature of the Gild to provide generally for all wants which the family union was no longer sufficient to satisfy, and ſor the provisions for which the State was not yet developed and strong enough.  To confederate in defence of liberty and right, was in itself the first requisite for the prosperity of trade and traffic.  The regulations also that a Gild-brother who had incurred losses by shipwreck or undeserved misfortune, should receive compensation, may properly be referred to here; and, more still, the gratuitous loans given to the poor Gild-brother for carrying on his trade.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS242">See pp. 176, 229, &amp;c. of Mr. Smith's collection.</NOTE1>Moreover, it was the special endeavour of the Gild to obtain privileges which would further trade, for instance, the right of coinage, staple-right, immunity from tolls, &amp;c.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS243">Ibid. pp. 151, 152.</NOTE1>  The Gild provided also for the regulation of industry, and for buying and selling (compare, for instance, the statutes of Berwick-upon-Tweed,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS244">Art. 22, 30, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43.  These Articles probably belonged to the various Gilds amalgamated in 1284.</NOTE1>and of the Gild of the Holy Trinity at Odensee);<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS245">See Wilda, p. 274.</NOTE1> and for institutions such as the cloth-halls, with their severe control of wares, of which there existed one as early as 1060 at Valenciennes.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS246">Moke, vol. ii. pp. 52, 90, 102.  See an account of English cloth halls in the <HI1 REND="i">Report and Minutes of Evidence on the State of the Woollen Manafacture of England</HI1>, 1806.  See also p. clxxi, below.</NOTE1>The importance of these cloth-halls may be seen from the fact that the merchants of Novgorod, after having several times received defective pieces of cloth from other places, determined that no cloth but that from the hall at Bruges should be allowed entrance into the Baltic ports and the Eastern markets.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS247">Ibid. p. 103.</NOTE1>  The sooner a town became chiefly a commercial place, <EPB/><PB N="cvii"/>the sooner did the Gild there take the character of a Merchant-Gild. These Gilds had also the superintendence of the craftsmen, as I shall notice when I speak of the origin of the Craft-Gilds. The Gilds founded by the merchants of the same land, even of the same town, in foreign countries—perhaps the oldest, and the prototypes of all others—and their confederacies among each other and with the mother country, the Hanse, can only be mentioned here, as to enter into details would lead us too far.</P><P>Though the Merchant-Gilds consisted chiefly of merchants, yet from the first, craftsmen as such were not excluded from them on principle, if only such craſtsmen possessed the full citizenship of the town, which citizenship—with its further development—depended upon the possession of estates of a certain value situated within the territory of the town.  The strict separation which existed between the merchants and the crafts probably arose only by degrees.  Originally the craftsmen, no doubt, traded in the raw materials which they worked with.  Thus the London tailors were, even in the time of Edward III., the great importers of woollen cloth;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS248">Herbert, vol. i. p. 29.</NOTE1> and as late as the sixteenth century the brewers of Hamburg were the principal corn-merchants.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS249">Wilda, p. 117.</NOTE1>The growth of wealth and of the number of the people necessarily called forth greater division of labour; the full citizens having become rich, only carried on trade, whilst the handicraft was left exclusively to the poor and the unfree.  The poor were originally excluded from full citizenship and from the Gild by the want of a property qualification; and when, in consequence of the development which has just been explained, the poor and the craftsmen became identical,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS250">See also Wilda, p. 300.</NOTE1> this led to the ordinance repeated in Danish, German, and Belgian Gild-statutes, that no one "with dirty hands," or "with blue nails," or "who hawked his wares in the streets," should become a member of the Gild, and that craftsmen, before being admitted, must have forsworn their trade for a year and a day.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS251">Moke, vol. ii. pp. 89, 90, 106, 141; i. p. 193; Wilda, pp. 75, 223, 274, 284, 300.</NOTE1>  The statement in the Gild-Statutes of Skanör<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS252">Wilda, p. 111.</NOTE1> of the year 1266, "that no baker should <HI1 REND="i">henceforth</HI1>be accepted as a member of the Gild," belongs probably to the time of the transition just described; perhaps, indeed, the bakers there had formerly been corn-merchants too.  Such a state of transition may also be inferred from Article 25<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS253">See p. 343 of Mr. Smith's collection.</NOTE1> of the statutes of Berwick, according to which no butcher, as long as he carried on his trade, was to deal in wool or hides, except he were ready to forswear his axe.  The facts are, that the Gild of Berwick was a <EPB/><PB N="cviii"/>decided Merchant-Gild, and that the members traded chiefly in wool or hides.  Formerly this trade was undoubtedly carried on with that of the butchers.  But after the craftsmen had been excluded from the Gild, the butchers were forbidden to carry on a trade practised by Gild members.  A like case was when the old laws of Gant forbade, in favour of the Gild-Merchant there, that clothes should be dyed for craftsmen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS254">Moke, vol. ii. p. 89.</NOTE1></P><P>But the craftsman was not only excluded from the Gild, he was governed, and even oppressed, by it.  Before, however, entering further upon this question, a short review of the foregoing investigation may be permitted.  I have shown above, how after the protection afforded by the old family had been weakened, the common want of protection called forth in neighbours a feeling of family solidarity, and unity of interests of all who were menaced, and how the weakness of them all caused a feeling of general equality and brotherly love; how this led to the entering upon close fraternities, or Gilds, in imitation of the family; how these Gilds were developed, especially in towns; how in their further growth they shut themselves up in their own doors; and how this caused the formation of similar associations among the excluded ſull-citizens; how, lastly, these associations amalgamated again with the highest Gild at a later period, or obtained a share in the government of the town. Great are the thanks, as Kemble<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS255"><HI1 REND="i">The Saxons in England</HI1>, vol. ii. p. 312.</NOTE1> justly and emphatically says, which we owe to these oldest defenders of the dignity of man against feudal arbitrariness: "in the times of the densest seignorial darkness, they offered a noble resistance to episcopal and baronial tyranny, and formed the nursery cradles of popular liberty."</P><P>Yet before this liberty attained a wider expansion, many a hard struggle had to be fought with those who had been its midwives. Independence being obtained, the old spirit departed from the citizens.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS256">A writer of the twelfth century describes the degeneration of the citizens as follows: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Igitur in initio communia fœderationis fuit grata quia optimi viri eam tum sanxere, vita quorum justa, simplex, innocens fuit, ac sine cupididate agitabatur; sua cuique satis honeste placebant, jus bonum apud ipsos valebat, concordia maxima, minima avaritia inerat.  Civis civem honorabat, dives minorem non exprobrabat.... Postquam vero cives paulatim cœpere torpescere et alter in alterum insurrexere, scelera sceleratorum multa (inulta) reliquere, quisque sua dishoneste dilatavere; . . . sic gradatim vi, mendacio, perjurio inferiores quoque opprimere cœpere; jus æquum, urbis bonum sic evanuit, corruit etiam dominium."</FOREIGN>(<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Chron. Aubertinum, ad annum</FOREIGN> 1138; <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Hist. Fr.</FOREIGN> vol. xiii. p. 499, quoted by Moke, vol. ii. p. 12.)  See also Moke, vol. ii. p. 92 sqq.  The victory of the Liège citizens over the Duke of Brabant at Steppes in 1213 was followed by a bitter oppression of the craftsmen by the ruling families, carried almost to slavery.  The craft organizations were abolished, and the presidents removed; the patricians went even so far as to forbid the craftsmen to drink wine, except in case of sickness (Moke, vol. ii. p. 69).</NOTE1>  The older the Gild-Statutes, the more favourable are <EPB/><PB N="cix"/>they to the man of low rank.  Though the citizens were modest and benignant towards the poor, as long as freedom was to be obtained, yet the possession of it rendered them insolent and hard.  By the enjoyment of power the descendants of the old simple associates of the Frith-Gilds became proud, ambitious, and tyrannical.  The freer and more independent the burghers became, and the less they needed assistance from the general body of the crafts for the defence of liberties acquired and the obtaining of ſresh ones, the greater was the degree in which this degeneration of the original noble spirit seems to have taken place.  At least it appears to me that the greater dependence on a strong executive power, in which the towns remained in England and Denmark, was one of the causes why we find there no patrician order, whilst the ruling class in the Belgian and German towns, which had grown into small, and almost independent, republics, formed itself into an exclusive aristocracy.  This aristocracy consisted chiefly of the descendants of the old merchant families, and partly of the offspring of the noble possessors of the surrounding estates, and of the officials originally appointed by the princes for the government of the towns.</P><P>The accumulation of riches helped to widen this ever-increasing breach between the feelings and interests of the different classes. Riches acquired by trade and employed in the purchase of estates and lucrative privileges, and the like, enabled the Gild-brothers to remain idle. Idleness became a matter of rank and of honour,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS257">Arnold, vol. ii. p. 195; Wilda, p. 201.</NOTE1>and a part only of the Gild-members carried on wholesale trade. Even the laws of the land make the distinction between the patrician and the man "without hearth and honour, who lives by his labour," and the former might with impunity box the ears of the latter for not showing him sufficient respect.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS258">Thus the municipal law of Brussels of the year 1229 (Moke, vol. ii. p. 115).</NOTE1>  As ever, the ruling class, these patricians, also threw the chief burden of the taxes upon the governed.  Frequent raisings of these taxes made them always more oppressive, while the income which they afforded, as well as the corporation property and the revenues it yielded, were employed for the private uses of the ruling families.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS259">Arnold, vol. i. pp. 418, 419, vol. ii. pp. 299, 343, 377; Moke, vol. ii. pp. 13, 25, &amp;c.  Lacomblet, <FOREIGN>Urkundenbuch des Niederrheins</FOREIGN>, vol. ii. p. 245, Dusseldorf, 1840: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Quod quociens placet maioribus ciuitatis, ipsi faciunt . . . noua exactionum statuta, quarum exactionum onus portant fraternitates et alii populares, qui communitas appellantur et sic depauperantur,"</FOREIGN> etc.</NOTE1>Besides this, the law was partially administered, or redress entirely refused to the unprivileged; and the worst oppressions <EPB/><PB N="cx"/>in consequence of the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">mundium</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS260">Protection given by a noble or rich man to a poorer, for services to be rendered, and assessments paid by the latter.</NOTE1> led to the fear that a new serfdom might arise.  As many of the craftsmen had once stood in the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">mundium</FOREIGN> of the bishop or the burgrave, as long as these ruled over the towns, so, after the patricians had got the dominion, a mundium of these over the lower classes came into existence, and those "who struck the lion down, had to pay the wolves homage." The mundmen were obliged to swear an oath (<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">fidelitas</FOREIGN>) and to agree to services and taxes, for which the mundmasters promised them protection and assistance.  This relation was particularly rigid at Strasburg; some of the ruling families there extorted in this way from the craftsmen a yearly rent of from 300 to 400 quarters of oats.  In Cologne the craftsmen were almost the serfs of the patricians.  Had the dominion of the patricians lasted longer, this dependence would certainly have become hereditary.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS261">Arnold, vol. i. p. 425; vol. ii. pp. 192, 193; Moke, vol. ii. p. 69; Lacomblet, vol. ii. p. 245.</NOTE1></P><P>The general deep hatred of the governed towards their oppressors seems therefore only too just; and the one idea which animated the souls of the craftsmen of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS262">Moke, vol. ii. p. 127, says: <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"L'histoire du 14 siècle n'a rien de plus extraordinaire que la persistance des tisserands et des foulons de Brabant à rêver encore leur cité détruite, comme jadis les Hebreux captifs songeaient à la reconstruction de Jerusalem."</FOREIGN></NOTE1> the abolition of the patriciate, seems only too easily to be understood.  It was not seldom that they were aided in this endeavour by the degeneration of the patricians themselves. The principles of association, of brotherly love and unity of interests, under which the patricians had grown free and strong, must have hindered the rivalries of the strong in all their endeavours; and in free competition they fought for superiority in the towns in which a patriciate was most predominant. I need only recall to mind the fights between the Overstolzen and the Weissen at Cologne, between the Zornen and the Mülnheimer at Strasburg, between the Starbearers and the Popinjays at Basle, the strifes of the Auer with the rest of the patricians at Ratisbon, and the similar differences among the ruling families at Spire.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS263">Arnold, vol. i. pp. 352, 366; vol. ii. pp. 297, 396.</NOTE1>  But the more the interests of the strong differed, the closer were the confederations of the weak.  Already in the thirteenth century in all these towns the most violent struggles broke out between the craftsmen, united in the most brotherly way into Craft-Gilds, and the hated patricians.  Tournai, Gant, Bruges, Brussels, Louvain, Huy, Liège, Cologne, Frankfort-on-Main, <EPB/><PB N="cxi"/>Spire, Strasburg, Bâle, Augsburg, Magdeburg, Halle, and all other towns, however named, were witnesses of the changing fortune of their contests.  Towards the end of the fourteenth century the victory was almost everywhere on the side of the Craft-Gilds.</P><P>Fierce<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS264">Thus, for instance, at Magdeburg in the year 1301 ten aldermen of the Craft-Gilds were burnt alive in the market-place.  After the Cologne weavers had lost, in 1371, the "Weavers' Battle" against the ruling families, thirty-three weavers were executed on November 21, 1371; on the day after also houses, churches, and monasteries were searched; all who were found were murdered; lastly, 1800 of them were exiled, with their wives and children, and their hall, "a palace," was demolished.  The exiled found a reception at Aix-la-Chapelle, where they helped considerably to raise their trade.  Further examples could easily be enumerated.</NOTE1> as the civil war had been, the people were moderate and generous in their victory.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS265">Compare the generous treatment of the South by the North after the close of the late civil war in the United States.</NOTE1>  Their idea was that of equality of political rights and of justice.  Notwithstanding their hatred against their tyrants, the multitude did not wish violence to put its stamp on their laws; they did not wish to oppress those who for former merits might have a right to participate in the government of the towns, and who by education were their superiors.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS266">See Arnold, vol. ii. p. 191.</NOTE1>  Mixed governing bodies were formed, consisting of patricians and craftsmen; and often even a majority of one vote was left to the former.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS267">Moke, vol. ii. p. 131.</NOTE1>In some places, it is true, the craftsmen compelled the patricians to enter their fraternities if they wished to take part in the government of the towns;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS268">See Moke, vol. ii. p. 80.  The same happened at Cologne.</NOTE1> but even then the great soon got such paramount influence, that new laws had to provide that the "small folk" should form half of the council of the Craft-Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS269">See Moke, vol. ii. p. 159.</NOTE1>The craftsmen did not, however, in the long run remain at the head of the town; but the political equality which their efforts had obtained was maintained in principle; the old Gild constitution was replaced by that of the "commune."</P><P>In England the same change of the town constitution went on at the same time.  The ordinance of the London citizens in Edward the Second's time, that no person, whether an inhabitant of the City or otherwise, should be admitted to the freedom of the City unless he were a member of one of the trades or mysteries,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS270">Herbert, vol. i. p. 27.</NOTE1>shows clearly the preponderance of the craftsmen.  But the completion of their triumph may be seen by the account, that "In the 49th Edward III. an enactment passed the whole assembled commonalty of the City, by which the right of election of all City dignitaries and officers, including members of parliament, was transferred <HI1 REND="i">from the ward-representatives to the trading-companies</HI1>."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS271">Quoted by Herbert, vol. i. p. 32, from Norton's <HI1 REND="i">Commentaries on London</HI1>.</NOTE1> <EPB/><PB N="cxii"/>In the year following, the number of the companies which took part in this election was increased from thirty-two to forty-eight.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS272">Herbert, vol. i. p. 33.</NOTE1>  Nevertheless here also the power remained ultimately in the hands of the old burghers.  When, after the ordinance under Edward II, all citizens of London were obliged to belong to the Trade-Gilds, the old burghers probably entered, as in a similar case the old ruling families of Cologne did,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS273">See Wilda, p. 259.</NOTE1> into some of the better Trade-Gilds, from which in later days sprang the so-called twelve great companies; and they pursued under new shapes their old political and industrial interests.  Already, towards the end of the reign of Edward III., the separation of these richer companies from the poorer ones may be observed. They gained paramount influence in the Common Council; and from this time dates the still-existing custom of choosing the Mayor of London exclusively from them.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS274">Herbert, vol i. p. 36 sqq.</NOTE1>  The Grocers—merchants who, according to Herbert,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS275">Ib. p. 29.</NOTE1> received their name from the engrossing (buying up wholesale) "all manner of merchandize vendible"—were particularly powerful.  Not less than sixteen aldermen belonged to their Gild, and in 1385 they carried the election of Sir Nicholas Brembre as Mayor for two successive years against the rest of the citizens.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS276">Ib. pp. 38, 39.</NOTE1>  As regards industry, the rule remained however for centuries, as will be shown further on, to the principle of small capital (see pp. cxxiii, cxxiv).</P><P>In the time of King Henry VI. the victory of the crafts was general in England; for about that time the kings, as Madox<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS277"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, p. 27.</NOTE1>tells us, began generally to recognize the constitution and liberties of towns in other terms than by confirming their Gilds.  "They granted to the men of a town or burgh that they should be a <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">communitas perpetua et corporata</FOREIGN>, a corporate and perpetual community."  The Craft-Gilds, whose rise the old city authorities had endeavoured till now also here to suppress, obtained the victory<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS278">See Delpit, <FOREIGN>Collection générale des documents franâais qui se trouvent en Angleterre</FOREIGN>, tom. i. p. lxxx.  Paris, 1847.</NOTE1> about the same time as their brethren on the Continent did.  A more detailed account of the transition is wanting. Nevertheless in England there is nothing to be found of the severe struggles of the German and Belgian companies against the patriciate.  The latter never attained a similar development on British soil; probably because, as has been stated, the rich did not obtain a similar independent dominion in the towns, which were less independent of the sovereign; and because <EPB/><PB N="cxiii"/>there is not in the English aristocracy in general that caste-like seclusion which characterizes the Continental nobility.  Greater freedom of the lower classes, as well as the gradual formation of political institutions according to the relative amount of the social power of different classes, which is so characteristic of England, perhaps contributed in this case too—as under similar circumstances of later times—to ward off a bloody revolution.</P><P>In the Danish towns also no real exclusive rule of special families seems to have sprung from the Gilds.  The towns in Denmark were smaller, and therefore the Gild did not appear, in proportion to the entire population, as a close circle of families.  Commerce was there of less importance, and so no very great difference arose between merchants and craftsmen in point of fortune. To this must be added the less independence of the towns in general as already mentioned.  For these reasons also the Gild existed in Denmark until the time of the Reformation, which shook vehemently the whole system of Gilds, and wrought the fall of most of them, on account of their connection with the Roman Catholic service.  At a later period, it is true, Gilds were carried on or re-established in Flensburg, Copenhagen, and other places.  But after the political as well as the religious objects of the Gilds had disappeared, there remained of their old essence nothing but social purposes.  Shooting at the popinjay was an old exercise handed down from the glorious times of the burghers, when they combated kings and made them responsible for wrongs committed on Gild-brothers.  This became now their chief object.  The old St. Canute-Gilds changed everywhere into Archer-Gilds; kings sometimes became members of them; and the degenerated descendants of the <FOREIGN>Hezlagh</FOREIGN> of Sleswig, instead of, like their forefathers, defending their old liberties and privileges against sovereigns with the bow, shot in common with them at the popinjay.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS279">Wilda, pp. 156 sqq., 161 sqq., 283 sqq.</NOTE1></P><P>In Germany too these Gilds, where they went on, and sometimes—as the House Limpurg in Frankfort-on-Main—still exist, sank into the same political insignificance; and the only advantage which the Gild now affords is the right of receiving assistance from its funds in certain emergencies of life.</P></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:3.10" TYPE="section"><EPB/><PB N="cxiv"/><HEAD>IV. THE CRAFT-GILDS.</HEAD><P>THE origin of the Craft-Gilds—which everywhere in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, as has just been shown, either snatched the government of the towns from the hands of the Old-burgher Gilds, or at least obtained a share in it by the side of those Gilds—has been the subject of considerable controversy. In spite of the absolutely independent origin and development of the handicrafts in the Germanic states of the Middle Ages, and in spite of their character being entirely different to that of the Romans, some authors, finding in the Roman <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">collegia opificum</FOREIGN>institutions which may in some degree be compared to the Craft-Gilds, have derived from them the unions of the handicraftsmen that sprung up with the handicrafts.  But this view needs rather to be proved historically by its adherents, than to be refuted by its opponents.  It would be much more probable that the Craft-Gilds descended from the companies into which, in episcopal and royal towns, the bond-handicraftsmen of the same trade were ranged under the superintendence of an official, or that they took their origin from a common subjection to police control or from common obligations to pay certain imposts.  But even these views deserve no further consideration after Wilda's striking refutation.  "The Craft-Gilds," as Wilda says, "did not spring from subjection and dependence; they originated in the freedom of the handicraft class."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS280">Wilda, p. 307.  Compare also Arnold, vol. i. pp. 250-258.</NOTE1></P><P>The population of the towns, at least of those on the Continent, consisted, as late as the eleventh century, of officials, old freemen, and bondmen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS281">See Additional Notes, No. 3.</NOTE1>  To the last belonged the greater part of the handicraftsmen, who, obliged to pay certain taxes and to perform certain feudal services and labours for their lords, were subjected to officers appointed by them.  But besides, there were free handicraftsmen, who in earlier times probably belonged to the body of the full citizens; for the expulsion of craftsmen as <EPB/><PB N="cxv"/>such from the full-citizens' Gilds, took place only at a later period of their development, as has been already stated in Part III. As long as one part of the handicraftsmen remained in the organized state of bondage just described, whilst the other part belonged to the full-citizens' Gilds, there was neither want nor room for a further free organization of that class, similar to that of the later Craft-Gilds.  The former stood, in all trade matters, entirely under the orders of the lords of the town, whether these were bishops, burgraves, or citizens; and as to legal protection, they were their clients.  But the handicraftsmen who were full-citizens received from the full-citizens' Gild on the one hand legal protection, and on the other hand by far greater advantages in matters of trade than even from the later Craft-Gilds; for as full-citizens,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS282">Wilda, p. 302.  Legal advice of the sheriffs of Magdeburg, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, to Duke Henry the Bearded, for his town Goldberg: <FOREIGN LANG="lat">"Noveritis vestre nobilitatis benignitas, quod quilibet burgensis, aut propriam habens domum vel aream quarumcunque rerum venalitatem habuerit, eas in domo propria libere vendere potest aut pro aliis rebus commutari.  De domo quoque, quam ad augmentandum censum vestrum in communi foro frequentari et per singulas mansiunculas inhabitari statuistis, scire debetis indubitanter, quod si dominus noster Archiepiscopus hoc in nostra civitate attemptaret penitus deficeret."</FOREIGN></NOTE1> these handicraftsmen enjoyed perfect freedom of trade in the towns, whilst the foreign handicraftsmen, and those who were not full-citizens, had to buy from the lords of the town the right of carrying on trade, and had to purchase, by various burdens and imposts, the privilege of using the markethalls and other institutions established ſor buying and selling.</P><P>After the free handicraftsmen had been expelled from the full-citizens' Gilds, their relation to the old-burghers was similar to that of the ancient freemen at the time when they confederated into Gilds for protection against the aggressions of the great. On the one hand, the citizens endeavoured to suppress the handicraftsmen into a kind of subjection, and on the other, as, after the expulsion of the royal and episcopal officers, they had the police in market and trade matters in their hands, it was in their power to take measures injurious to the craftsmen.  The old-burghers must have felt a great temptation to subject the handicraftsmen, sprung from the free families, to the same imposts as those paid by the bondmen.  The right also to allow foreigners, on payment of entrance fees, to carry on trade, could not but endanger the interests of the native craftsmen.  Just as in earlier times the maintenance of the personal liberty and the preservation of the small freeholds of the old freemen were concerned, so the question was now to protect the independence of the craftsmen and their earnings, which depended on their stock <EPB/><PB N="cxvi"/>and labour.  Isolated, they must have succumbed to the difficulty of their circumstances; hence these of necessity called forth the same free organization of free craftsmen, as that of the old freemen in earlier times.  The constitution of the old Gilds evidently served as the model of the Craft-Gilds, and it appears to have been altered only in so far as a change was rendered necessary by the peculiar wants of the craftsmen which made them confederate into Gilds, namely, protection of the industry of the freemen.</P><P>Foremost amongst the free handicraftsmen were the Weavers. They formed a kind of middle class between the patricians and the bond craftsmen.  The fact that whilst the other crafts worked to supply mere local demands, the Weavers' manufactures found markets in the most distant countries, naturally invested them with greater importance.  They were distinguished above all others by wealth, self-respect, and a sense of freedom. Their unions enjoyed of old the greatest independence.  In all towns they stood at the head of the craftsmen; and the contests of the handicraft class with the patricians for political emancipation, and its victories, were, above all, the struggles and victories of the Weavers.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS283">Arnold, vol. ii. p. 208, and Moke, vol. ii. passim.</NOTE1></P><P>Accordingly, in all the manufacturing countries of that time, in England, Flanders and Brabant, as well as in the Rhenish towns, the most ancient Gilds were those of the Weavers.  The Gild of the London Weavers was chartered by Henry I.,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS284">Delpit, vol. i. p. lxxxiii.</NOTE1> and so was that of the Oxford Weavers.  In the reign of Henry II. Weavers' Gilds, confirmed by the king, existed at Nottingham, York, Huntingdon, Lincoln, and Winchester.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS285">Wilda, p. 314.</NOTE1>  In Germany the Wool-weavers' Gild of Cologne arose as early as the eleventh century.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS286">Arnold, vol. i. p. 254.</NOTE1>And in like manner the oldest German charter<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS287">Lacomblet, vol. i. p. 251.

It is utterly unlike the manner in which all other Craft-Gilds have been chartered.</NOTE1> is that of a Cologne Weavers' Gild. In the year 1149 the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">textores culcitrarum pulvinarium</FOREIGN> (weavers of pillowcases) formed a fraternity with the consent of the judges, sheriſſs, and aldermen; and thenceforth all who wished to carry on the trade within the town were obliged to join the fraternity and to submit to its rules.  The record proves that a union of these handicraftsmen had existed long before the year 1149, and <EPB/><PB N="cxvii"/>that it was merely confirmed in the said year.  At Spire the Gild of the Wool-weavers existed at the beginning of the twelfth century.  At Mayence the Weavers are mentioned as early as 1099; at Worms in 1114.  At Frankfort-on-Main also, wool-weaving ranked first among the crafts.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS289">Arnold, vol. i. p. 254, &amp;c.</NOTE1>  It was, however, in the first manufacturing country of the Middle Ages, in Flanders and Brabant, that the influence of the Wool-weavers' Gild was the most prominent: it appears there as almost the sole leader in all the revolutions of the handicraft class.  And when we consider the early flourishing state of the Belgian woollen manufactures—for as early as the first century the clothes of coarse wool woven in Belgium found a greedy market in Rome;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS290">Moke, vol. i. p. 58.</NOTE1> also, that the necessity of defending their coasts against the inroads of the sea and of pirates<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS291">Ibid. p. 51.</NOTE1> always kept most keenly alive in the minds of the people the fundamental idea of all Gilds, the brotherly solidarity and community of interests; lastly, the bold spirit of independence which led even serfs here to confederate into Gilds,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS292">See Part I. of this Essay, pp. lxxvi, lxxviii, lxxix.</NOTE1>—we may infer that here, among these extremely industrious and stubborn weavers of Flanders and Brabant, did the first Craft-Gild originate.</P><P>Although the Craft-Gilds arose first among the most eminent of the handicraft class, among those who were free,—just as in earlier times the most ancient Gilds originated among the old freemen, and later on the Trade-Unions among the best situated working men and ci-devant small masters,—to stop the deterioration of their condition and encroachments on their rights and interests, yet this new organization was also soon made use of by the lower members of their class as a means of elevation. With the liberation of the bond handicraftsmen from bondage proper, many of the companies into which they had been ranged passed gradually over into the number of free Craft-Gilds.  The latter appear, therefore, everywhere in greater number about the time when the last traces of bondage disappear.  Craft-Gilds of this kind, when obtaining their privileges, were frequently put under obligation to pay certain fixed imposts in return for their greater independence in labour and trade, and for the remission of the fines on inheriting property,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS293">I find in the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Vita Gebehardi Episcopi Constantiensis</FOREIGN> (Pertz, Seriptores, vol. x. p. 588, lines 32-59:  <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Post hæc convocatis servis suis elegit ex eis optimos quosque, et constituit ex eis coquos et pistores, caupones et fullones, sutores et hortulanos, carpentarios et singularum artium magistros, et constituit eis, ut eo die, quo fratribus deservirent, de annona quoque fratrum in patre reficerentur, quia dignus est operarius cibo suo.  Ut autem bono animo suis ministrarent dominis, huiusmodi donario ipsos cumulavit, scilicet ut cum quis præsentium vel eorum successorum, qui de progenie illorum esset, moreretur, exuviæ de eo non sumerentur, sed hæredes relictam hæreditatem indivisam possiderent; si vero de alia progenie aliquis accessisset, ab hoc donativo alienus exstitisset."</FOREIGN>  For the bond-handicraftsmen in towns and their societies, see Additional Notes, No. 3.</NOTE1> to which their <EPB/><PB N="cxviii"/>episcopal or lay lords were entitled, as well as for other matters. And in proportion to the degree of independence which they obtained according to circumstances, these imposts were greater or smaller.  Such, for instance, was the case at Bâle, Constance, &amp;c.  Everywhere, however, these societies were changed after the model of the Gilds of those farther advanced craftsmen which have been spoken of.  The latter impregnated them with an altogether different spirit and a new life.  A similar process may have taken place, in certain cases,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS294">Perhaps the many religious regulations, and the many relations to the cathedral, of some of the Gilds at Bâle (compare, for instance, Berlepsch, vol. ii. pp. 18, 19), as well as of the Fullers at Lincoln (compare Mr. T. Smith's collection, p. 179), refer to such a process, though it seems rather doubtful to me.  But see also Mr. Ludlow in the <HI1 REND="i">Fortnightly Review</HI1>, October, 1869, p. 393.</NOTE1> in fraternities originally religious, which, after the origin of Craft-Gilds, framed trade regulations after the latter's example, and—as in later times certain friendly societies changed into Trade-Unions—so gradually transformed themselves into Craft-Gilds.  The time of the origin of Craft-Gilds in general may be said to extend from the beginning of the eleventh to the middle of the thirteenth century.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS295">Compare Arnold, l. c.</NOTE1>The origin of certain Craft-Gilds depended of course on the gradual rise of the various trades in a town.</P><P>The organization of the free craftsmen into Gilds, we thus see, was called forth by their want of protection against the abuse of power on the part of the lords of the town, who tried to reduce the free to the dependence of the unfree, and, by imposts and otherwise, to encroach on the freemen's earnings.  Being organized, the Craft-Gildmen provided for the maintenance of the customs of their Craft, framed further ordinances for its regulation, saw these ordinances properly executed, and punished the Gild brothers who infringed them. The maintenance of their independence against the city authorities, and the possibility of carrying out and making efficient their trade-rules, depended, however, on the condition that all who carried on the trade should belong to the Gild. And though the first Gilds, at their formation, included doubtless all men of the trade, yet in course of time some one or more craftsmen must have turned up, who, unwilling to submit to the rules framed for insuring good work and for protecting the interests of the trade, would carry on his trade without belonging to the Gild.  It was impossible either to check this, and prevent detriment arising from it, or to enforce their <EPB/><PB N="cxix"/>regulation of the trade in a legitimate manner, unless the Gild had been previously acknowledged by the lord of the town or the body of citizens.  And thus, though the Craft-Gilds as voluntary societies did not need confirmation by the authorities at their birth, yet this confirmation became afterwards of the greatest importance when these Gilds wanted to be recognized as special and independent associations, which were thenceforth to regulate the trade instead of the authorities of the town.  This once obtained, all further protective measures would follow as a matter of course.</P><P>This transfer of all trade concerns to the management and jurisdiction of the Craft-Gild was generally accomplished by a confirmation of their ordinance, that every one carrying on the trade within the town or a certain district, should join and belong to the Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS296">Lacomblet, vol. i. p. 251.

But as, in consequence of these privileges of the Craft-Gilds, the citizens no longer enjoyed undivided sway in the towns, they showed themselves everywhere extremely jealous of the jurisdiction which had thus sprung up in their midst, to their own detriment.  They therefore opposed with all their might the establishment of Craft-Gilds; and the whole history of these Gilds, till they obtained the mastery in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, appears as nothing else than one continual struggle of the handicraftsmen with the town for these privileges.  The Norman kings however, equally ready to make the most of both these clashing interests <EPB/><PB N="cxx"/>for the benefit of their exchequer, seem to have put up to auction the confirmation and the suppression of these Gilds.</P><P>The contest of the Weavers with the City of London furnishes us with a very striking example of this struggle between the rising Craft-Gilds and the body of the old citizens.  The Weavers had obtained from Henry I. the privilege that "nobody, except by them (i. e. by becoming a member of their Gild), shall introduce himself, within the City, into their mystery, and nobody within Southwark or other places belonging to London, except he be a member of their Gild;"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS299">Madox, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, p. 286: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"nullus nisi per illos se intromittat infra civitatem de eorum ministerio et nisi sit in eorum Gilda neque in Sudworc neque in aliis locis Londoniæ pertinentibus."</FOREIGN>  The words <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"ministerium"</FOREIGN> or <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"officium"</FOREIGN>were used in medieval Latin for mystery, trade, craft-gild.</NOTE1> and these privileges were confirmed to them by Henry II.  Exemption from the jurisdiction of the City excited the jealousy of the citizens to such a degree, that the Weavers' Gild had to maintain the most violent struggles with them for its privileges and property.  King John had to promise the citizens, in answer to their prayer, "that the Gild of Weavers shall not from henceforth be in the City of London, neither shall be at all maintained;" but as the Gild had been accustomed to pay the king eighteen marks per annum, the citizens "should pay twenty marks in money for a gift" instead. It appears, however, that this suppression of the Craft-Gilds was as ineffective here as in the like case in Belgium and Germany; for as early as the sixth year of Henry III. (A. D. 1221-22) we find the Weavers and the City again at strife; and "the Weavers of London," as Madox relates, "fearing lest the mayor and citizens of London should extort from them their charter and liberties granted to them by King Henry II., delivered that charter into the Exchequer, to be kept in the treasury there, and to be delivered to them again when they should want it, and afterwards to be laid up in the treasury."  Even in the fourteenth year of Edward II. (A. D. 1320-1) the privileges of the Weavers remained still a point of contention between them and the town; but in this case it was before a court of justice.  On occasion, as it appears, of a complaint for transgression and abuse of their privileges, the Weavers had to prove their right to have a Gild, as well as the legality of every single ordinance framed by them for the regulation of their trade.  Their privileges could not, however, be impugned as a whole, but several regulations were pointed out which had crept in after the grant of their charter.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS300">Compare Madox, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, p. 192, &amp;c.; Herbert, vol. i. pp. 17, 24.</NOTE1>  Among the documents contained in Mr. Toulmin Smith's collection, those referring to the Tailors' Gild at Exeter <EPB/><PB N="cxxi"/>showeven in the fifteenth century the existence of the same struggle between this Gild and the authorities of the town.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS301">Mr. Toulmin Smith's collection, pp. 299-316.</NOTE1>  Sometimes, as in the case of the Bakers' Gild at Bâle, these conflicts, which the new organization of the handicraftsmen called forth between their wardens and the police authorities of the towns, were the chief cause of fixing the rights of the Craft-Gild in a charter.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS302">Compare Wilda, p. 310.</NOTE1></P><P>To the complete independence of the Craft-Gilds, it was indispensable that they should have the right of freely electing a warden for regulating their trade and for managing the Gild. In England this freedom was never restricted; at least, I know nothing to the contrary from the accounts of English Craft-Gilds.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS303">The governor, however, of the fraternity of the Porters in London, constituted in 1646, is always an alderman, whose appointment is vested in the Court of Aldermen.

Thus the Craft-Gilds which the free handicraftsmen formed amongst themselves possessed, of old, absolute independence in the election of their warden, as, for instance, the Weavers' Gild at Cologne,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS304">Lacomblet, vol. ii. p. 250.

But this of course changed at once with the triumph of the handicraftsmen.</P><P>This triumph, as has been shown in Part III., was won everywhere in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, though sooner or later, according to circumstances.  In London the Craft-Gilds appear in full possession of the mastery in the reign of Edward III.  The privileges which they had till then exercised only on sufferance, or on payment of their fermes, were now for the first time generally confirmed to them by charter by Edward III.; the authorities of the City of London, who had in former times contended with all their might against the Craft-Gilds, now approved of their statutes; and in the fourteenth century a large majority of the trades appeared before the mayor and aldermen to get their ordinances enrolled.  At the same time they adopted a particular livery, and were hence called Livery Companies.  Edward III. himself actually became a member of one of them, that of the Linen-armourers, and his example found numerous imitators amongst his successors and the nobility of the kingdom.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS311">Compare Herbert, vol. i. pp. 28, 29; Delpit, p. lxxx., and the numerous ratifications of ordinances by the City authorities from 1344—1418 in Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>.</NOTE1></P><EPB/><PB N="cxxiii"/><P>Though political power, as has been already stated, did not continue everywhere in the hands of the handicraftsmen, they yet retained everywhere the independent government and jurisdiction over their trade; and everywhere the fundamental principle of their trade-policy prevailed, namely, the protection to live freely and independently on an industry based on small capital and labour.  This was shown in England by the Act 37 Edward III. c. 5 (A. D. 1363).  In the nineteenth year of Edward III. (A. D. 1345), a part of the Pepperers had separated themselves from their old Gild and had formed a society of their own.  The account<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS312">See the detailed account of the proceedings in Herbert, vol. i. pp. 43-45, also pp. 304-308.</NOTE1> of what took place at the formation of this society,—how "twenty-two persons, carrying on the business of Pepperers, agree to meet together at a dinner" (for defraying the expense of which each had to pay twelve pence), "and commit the particulars of their formation into a trading society to writing," and then immediately after the meal elect their warden, and decide on their periodical contributions,—shows great similarity with the proceedings at the formation of modern working-men's associations; as, for instance, those of the Bookbinders' Trade Society, according to Dunning's excellent account.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS313"><HI1 REND="i">Trades' Societies and Strikes.  Report of the Committee on Trades' Societies appointed by the Social Science Association</HI1>, p. 93, &amp;c.  London, 1860.</NOTE1>  But these twenty-two Pepperers—altogether unlike their Bookbinder imitators—were the richest of their trade,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS314">Compare Herbert, vol. i. pp. 304-308.</NOTE1> and had probably belonged formerly to the old-citizen class, and had, like all citizens under Edward II., been obliged to join a Trade-Gild. Well, these seceding Pepperers now formed themselves into a separate society, exercised still <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">de facto</FOREIGN> the freedom of trade which had formerly belonged to them as full citizens, and thus threatened to crush, by their riches, the numerous other Trade-Gilds.  At least a petition brought against them in the 36th Edward III. complains "that great mischiefs had newly arisen, as well to the king as to the great men and commons, from the merchants called Grocers (grossers), who engrossed all manner of merchandize vendible, and who suddenly raised the prices of such merchandize within the realm; putting to sale by covin, and by ordinances made amongst themselves, in their own society, which they call 'the Fraternity and Gild of Merchants,' such merchandizes as were most dear, and keeping in stores the others until times of dearth and scarcity."  In consequence of this, the Act 37th Edward III. c. 5 decreed "that all artificers and people of mysteries shall each choose his own <EPB/><PB N="cxxiv"/>mystery before the next Candlemass; and that having so chosen it, he shall henceforth use no other."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS315">Herbert, vol. i. pp. 29, 30.</NOTE1>  This was a legal recognition of the principle of the trade-policy of the craftsmen, namely, that provision should be made to enable every one, with a small capital and his labour, to earn his daily bread in his trade freely and independently, in opposition to the principle of the rich, "freedom of trade."  In like manner this principle became prevalent in all the Craft-Gilds on the Continent, and we find it formulated with special clearness in the Emperor Sigismund's extremely original "Secular Reformation" of 1434.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS316">Goldasti, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Constitutiones Imperiales</FOREIGN>, tom. iv. p. 189, Francof. 1713.  After much complaining "that one person carries on more trades than belong to him," it is said in cap. v., "Will you hear however what is ordained by Imperial law?  Our forefathers have not been fools.  The crafts have been devised for this purpose, that everybody by them should earn his daily bread, and nobody shall interfere with the craft of another.  By this the world gets rid of its misery, and every one may find his livelihood.  If there be one who is a wineman, he shall have to do with this (i. e. the wine trade), and shall not practise another thing besides.  Is he a bread-baker, the same, &amp;c., no craft excepted.  And it is to be prevented on Imperial command, and to be fined with forty marks of gold, where it is heard that the Imperial towns do not attend to this, that nobody of any trade whatever shall interfere with the craft of another," &amp;c.  Compare also cap. viii.</NOTE1></P><P>This period of development of the Craft-Gilds was followed by a further extension of them in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and soon afterwards by their degeneration.  But before I enter upon this question, and upon the abuses which undisputed possession of their privileges and the ſull sway in all trade matters produced in them, I wish to speak more fully of the constitution of the Craft-Gilds during the first stage of their growth .<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS317">For the sake of completeness, and to avoid repetitions, I have sometimes also availed myself in the following statements of Gild-Statutes of the fourteenth century, except as to such points of course in which the degeneration had already begun in the fourteenth century.</NOTE1>  This constitution was but the perfect expression of the wants which called forth the Craft-Gilds, and of the task which they had to perform.  Their fundamental principle was the same as that of the Frith-Gilds, that is, of those artificial unions which sprang up to replace the natural family compact, and to secure the protection which the latter afforded to their members in former times (see Part I.).  The Craft-Gilds themselves first sprang up amongst the free craftsmen, when they were excluded from the fraternities which had taken the place of the family unions, and later among the bondmen, when they ceased to belong to the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">familia</FOREIGN> of their lord.  Like those Frith-Gilds, the object of the early Craft-Gilds was to create relations as if among brothers; and above all things, to grant to their members that assistance which the member of a family <EPB/><PB N="cxxv"/>might expect from that family.  As men's wants had become different, this assistance no longer concerned the protection of life, limbs, and property, for this was provided for by the Frith-Gilds, now recognized as the legitimate authority; but the principal object of the Craft-Gilds was to secure their members in the independent, unimpaired, and regular earning of their daily bread by means of their craft.  When then the Craft-Gilds, like the earlier Gilds for the maintenance of justice (Part I. pp. lxxiv, lxxv), were legally recognized, and were brought into the State organism as special associations for the regulation of their trade, a new fundamental element, namely, their quality as a police authority, was added to the element common to all Gilds.</P><P>Both these elements are to be found in the Craft-Gilds of all countries; indeed, in all they attained a development so similar, even in details, that whosoever knows the Gild-Statutes of one country, knows those of all.  Only in certain concrete regulations do we find deviations which I will point out in the course of this treatise.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS318">In order not to have to cite repeatedly the same sources for every individual statement, I refer here in general to Herbert, vol. i. pp. 40-102; also to the Ordinances in Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, and to Mr. Toulmin Smith's collection, especially to pp. 179, 182, 184, 208, 284, 312, 331, 334.

These meetings were always held with certain ceremonies, for the sake of greater solemnity.  The box, having several locks like that of the Trade-Unions, and containing the charters of the Gild, the statutes, the money, and other valuable articles, was opened on such occasions, and all present had to uncover their heads.  These meetings possessed all the rights which they themselves had not chosen to delegate.  They elected the Presidents (originally called Aldermen, afterwards Masters and Wardens) and other officials, except in those cases already mentioned, in which the master was appointed by the king, the bishop, or the authorities of the town.  As a rule, the Gilds were free to choose their masters, either from their own members, or from men of higher rank, though they were sometimes limited in their choice to the former.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS319">There was a contest on that account at Cologne in the year 1258 between the Archbishop and the Craft-Gilds.  Lacomblet, vol. ii. p. 247; compare also Wilda, p. 324.  See also Mr. T. Smith's collection, p. 305.</NOTE1>  Did the election fall on a member who would not accept it, he was subjected to fines.  Of a council, <EPB/><PB N="cxxvi"/>which (like that of the Court of Assistants of later times) stood by the side of the masters, we find in early days at most but a trace, in the quorum of members which had to co-operate with the master on various occasions, as, for instance, in the exercise of jurisdiction.  In Germany we find something similar in the council of six or eight men of some Gilds at Bâle and Vienna<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS320">See the Gardeners of Bâle (Wilda, p. 325), the <FOREIGN>Spinnwetter</FOREIGN> at Bâle 1271 (Berlepsch, vol. ix. p. 20), the Tailors of Vienna 1340 (Berlepsch, vol. ii. p. 226).</NOTE1>earlier than in England, where we first notice in 1397, in the records of the Grocers, that six persons of that company were chosen to aid the wardens in the discharge of their duties.  These cases excepted, assistants are first met with in the sixteenth century. We also find in the Grocers, as early as 1348, four auditors "to superintend the accounts and delivery of the wardens."</P><P>The wardens summoned and presided at the meetings, with their consent enacted ordinances for the regulation of the trade, saw these ordinances properly executed, and watched over the maintenance of the customs of the craft.  They had the right to examine all manufactures, and a right of search for all unlawful tools and products.  They formed, with the assistance of a quorum of Gild-brothers, the highest authority in all the concerns of the Gild.  No Gild-member could be arraigned about trade-matters before any other judge.  We have still numerous documentary proofs<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS321">Compare, for instance, Mr. T. Smith's collection, p. 321; Herbert, vol. i. p. 47. &amp;c.</NOTE1> of the severity and justice with which the wardens exercised their juridical duties.  Whenever they held a court, it was under special forms and solemnities: thus, for instance, in 1275 the chief warden of the Masons building Strasburg Cathedral held a court sitting under a canopy.  The local trades of the towns continued under a certain amount of control by the town authorities even after the Craft-Gilds had obtained power.  The elected wardens had to be brought every year before the mayor, and had to swear "faithfully to execute their offices."  The mayor also decided disputes between the several Gilds, and could fine and imprison the wardens of companies at his pleasure.  The control of the sale of the most necessary provisions, such as bread, meat, drink, and fuel, was the special care of the town authorities, in order to prevent adulteration and overcharges.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS322">Mr. T.

For enforcing payment of entrance-fees, contributions towards paying the fermes (dues), as well as of fines, the Craft-Gilds made use of the very means so much talked of in the case of the Sheffield Trade-Unions, namely, <HI1 REND="i">rattening</HI1>, that is, they took away the tools of their debtors.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS325">Compare Herbert, vol. i. p. 18.  "Why the working implements of such of the mystery as were in arrears for their fermes might be distrained by the bailiffs of the Gild, to the amount it was computed they owed, and such distresses sold to pay the same? ... why on non-payment of a member's share of the king's ferme, his working tools to the amount should be sold, or detained in the custody of the bailiffs; and also that any member offending against the liberties of the Gild, should be adjudged in like manner to have his working implements seized and disposed of? ... also if any withheld from another of the Gild his proper wages, and would not pay him, the Gild had power by their bailiffs to distrain...."</NOTE1>It is true that they, as their claims were legally recognized, could sell the tools and take what was due to them out of the proceeds, whilst the want of such recognition compelled the Trade-Unions to enforce payment of arrears by hiding and detaining the objects seized upon.  This coercive measure existed unchanged even in the seventeenth century;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS326">Compare Herbert, vol. i. pp. 191, 192.  "If anie member, of his froward disposition or otherwise, refuse to pay quarterage, penalties, arrearages, or other amerciaments, the master and wardens, with their officers, shall have power at lawful times to enter such member's shop, and distrain the same."  The same measures, seizure of tools and closing a member's shop, were also the means of coercion and punishment in the German Craft-Gilds, the so-called <SOCALLED>"Handwerklegen"</SOCALLED>(i. e. stopping of the craft of a member).  Compare Pölitz und Bülau, <FOREIGN>Neue Jahrbücher der Geschichte und Politik</FOREIGN>, 1843, vol. i. p. 359, &amp;c.</NOTE1> so that this rattening, <EPB/><PB N="cxxviii"/>which called forth such pharisaical indignation from the united employers' press, probably enjoys an uninterrupted descent from employers' associations up to the time of Edward II.  But it is even far older.  It is the old right of distraint of the creditor against the debtor, which occurs in the earliest laws of all German tribes, and was lawfully exercised in Germany up to the sixteenth century.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS327">See Walter's <FOREIGN>Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte</FOREIGN>, Bonn, 1853, ò 538, and Bluntschli's <FOREIGN>Deutsches Privatrecht</FOREIGN>, ò 102, No. 3.</NOTE1></P><P>As the object of the association of craftsmen was the regulation of their trade, it was a necessary condition of the efficient working of their rules, that all who carried on the trade should belong to it.  This was a matter of course, when they had been legally recognized as a special authority for lawful purposes.  Hence it is altogether wrong to represent the constantly recurring ordinance, that every one carrying on the trade should join the Gild, as a consequence of the monopolistic tendencies of the Craft-Gilds. There was, on the contrary, no question whatever of a monopoly in that time.  It was not then as it was at the time of the degeneration of the Craft Gilds, when, as corporations with a limited number of members, they prohibited all non-members of the Gild from carrying on the trade.  On the contrary, every person was at first permitted to carry on the trade, if only he joined and submitted himself to the organism created for the purpose of regulating it, that is, if he entered the Craft-Gild; and then, as a member entitled to vote, he exercised influence on its decisions.  The yearly fermes (dues) too, which the craftsmen had to pay for their privileges, sufficiently explain their wish to draw into their society all the men of their trade, in order to secure increased contributions; and when Edward III. granted a special Gild to the Flemish Weavers, the indignation of the London Weavers may be easily understood, as well as their effort to make the Flemish men participate in the payment of their fermes.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS328">Compare Herbert, vol. i. p. 20, note; Madox, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Firma Burgi</FOREIGN>, pp. 194, 195.</NOTE1></P><P>The income of the Craft-Gilds consisted of small entrancefees, of wax for the churches, and of taxes which were levied for special purposes as they occurred; for instance, on the death, impoverishment, pilgrimage, &amp;c. of a member.  Regular periodical contributions are only met with at a later stage.</P><P>The rules laid down by the Gilds, and to which all men of the trade had to submit, had reference (1) partly to securing the good quality of the work, and (2) partly, like all Gild-Statutes, to the temporal and eternal welfare of their members.  Both kinds of <EPB/><PB N="cxxix"/>rules were consequences of the fundamental principle of all Gilds, namely, care for the common interest by means of association. In the first kind, however, the function of the Gild, as a police authority on behalf of the public, possibly prevailed.  But even in them the idea was present that by these measures they protected themselves against loss of the honour and good repute of the trade, as well as against loss of custom.  The latter motive may be especially attributed to those craftsmen who, like the Weavers, worked for a more extensive market.</P><P>Wherever the Craft-Gilds were legally acknowledged, we find foremost, that the right to exercise their craft, and sell their manufactures, depended upon the freedom of their city, a fact which is sufficiently explained by the political tendencies of the Craft-Gilds.  It is an exception when we find, as in the case of the Fullers of Lincoln, that strangers also were admitted on payment of special taxes to the Gild.  On the Continent, after the fourteenth century, a system of reciprocity was frequently established between the several towns, as for instance in 1365 at Tournay.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS329">Ouin-Lacroix, p. 749—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Tisserands de Tournay en 1365</FOREIGN>, art. vi.. <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Ceux qui ne sont pas de Tournay ne pourront y exercer ce métier, que dans le cas ou les habitants de cette ville pourront exercer le même métier, dans celles d'où ces étrangers sont originaires."</FOREIGN></NOTE1></P><P>No one was admitted to any trade, even to the lowest, or tolerated in it, whose moral conduct and honour were not stainless; no one, also, who had not proved himself a proper workman; and, therefore, no one who had not served a regular apprenticeship. The duration of this apprenticeship differed in various trades. In England it generally lasted seven years, in France from three to four, sometimes six; in Germany from two to four years.  The admission of an apprentice was an act of special solemnity, corresponding to the important legal consequences it involved. As it was the beginning of a kind of novitiate to citizenship, it generally took place in the Town-hall, in the presence of the town authorities (in London, even in the present day,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS330">Compare Arundell's <HI1 REND="i">Reminiscences of the City of London and its Livery Companies</HI1>, p. 162, London, 1869.  For the instructions to apprentices from the sixteenth century, see Stow's <HI1 REND="i">Survey of London</HI1>, Edit. 1720, p. 328.  Compare too Moke, vol. i. p. 195, Berlepsch <HI1 REND="i">passim</HI1>, for instance, vol. ix. p. 29.</NOTE1> it is performed in the Guildhall by the Chamberlain of the City), or in solemn meeting of the Craft-Gild.  On this occasion the apprentice was specially instructed in his duties, both as to his moral conduct and the trade.  At last, a record of the act—the indenture—was drawn up, which also contained the special conditions under which the apprentice was placed with his master. By this admission the apprentice became a member of the family of his master, who instructed him in his trade, and who, like a <EPB/><PB N="cxxx"/>father, had to watch over his morals, as well as his work, during his apprenticeship.  At the expiration of his apprenticeship the lad (then a man) was received into the Gild again with special forms and solemnities, and became thereby a citizen of the town. On both occasions a fee had to be paid: in London it was 2<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> 6<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> on becoming an apprentice, and 3<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> 4<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> on becoming a member of the Gild.</P><P>After the care for skilful workmen, the next concern of the Gild was for the use of proper tools, and the application of welladapted processes of manufacture.  No member of the Gild was allowed to possess tools "unless the same were testified to be good and honest;" and the statutes contained directions and prohibitions, entering into the most minute details, with reference to the method of working.  It was specially forbidden, in the strongest terms, to mix inferior materials with a better sort, to the detriment of the buyer, or to sell patched-up articles as new.  Measures were also taken to protect the public against the spoiling of materials entrusted to the craftsmen for manufacture.  Thus, the statutes of the Whittawers<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS331">Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, p. 232.  See also <HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1>, pp. 321 &amp;c., 331.</NOTE1> directed the Gild-brothers to assist a member who did not know how to go on with his work, in order that it might not be spoiled. Such directions are specially frequent among the Masons,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS332">Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, pp. 280-282—Regulations for the trade of Masons. According to them, he "who wishes to undertake work in gross" has to bring forward four ancient men of his trade as security for the proper execution of the work; and they, in the event of his not fulfilling his duty, have to execute the work themselves.  Compare also the Code of the Rochlitz Stonemasons of 1462, art. 3-7 (Berlepsch, vol. viii. p. 196).</NOTE1> from whom customers received special guarantees for the proper completion of their work.  We also find sanitary regulations with regard to the observance of cleanliness in carrying on the craft. Subject to these measures of supervision, all Gild associates were allowed to sell all articles of the trade within the town, and without any other control than that of the Gild.</P><P>Nominally, to insure the good quality of their wares, the Gild-Statutes always ordain that no one "shall work longer than from the beginning of the day until curfew," nor "at night by candle-light." But doubtless the real ground for this ordinance was rather regard for the well-being of the Gild-brothers; it was the wish to give them leisure for fulfilling their domestic and political duties, and to prevent the collective body from being forced to over-exertions by the competition of a few too zealous for gain, and from being thus deprived of every enjoyment of life.  Similar considerations were also sometimes the cause of <EPB/><PB N="cxxxi"/>long holidays; as for instance of the prohibition of the London Weavers<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS333">Herbert, vol. i. p. 19.  The acts and ordinances of the Company of Cutlers and makers of knives in Hallamshire prescribe in art. i. that no manufacturer, whether master, servant, or apprentice, shall perform "any work apperteyninge to the said scyence and mysterye of Cutlers" for twenty-eight days next ensuing the 8th day of August in each year, nor from Christmas to the 23rd of January; and in Art. iv., "No person occupying any wheel for the grinding of knives to allow of any work being done there during the holiday months.  Penalty as before."  (Hunter's <HI1 REND="i">History of Sheffield</HI1>, p. 119.)</NOTE1> to work between Christmas and Purification-day (Feb. 2).  The same considerations, supported by religious motives, caused the strict prohibition of work on Sundays and festivals, and "on Saturday or the eve of a double feast, after noon has been rung."  This last ordinance, forbidding work on the last mentioned afternoons, was common to all countries, and had its origin in a custom of the Roman-Catholic Church to solemnize the eve of festivals and Sundays by religious services.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS334">See, on the Saturday half-holiday in England in A.D. 1303, Robert of Brunne's <HI1 REND="i">Handlyng Synne</HI1>, ed. 1862. (Note by F. J. F.)</NOTE1>Hence it was lost at the Reformation; and it was not till lately that English workmen were able to regain their lost holiday. There were also other measures arising from this general tendency to prevent a ruinous competition amongst Gild-brothers, as contrary to the spirit of brotherhood.  Their ordinances were framed for the "better relief and comodytie of the porer sorte." No Gild-associate was to entice away a brother's customers nor a brother's servant.  We frequently also meet with restrictions in the number of servants and apprentices which an individual member was allowed to have.  And at an early period regulations as to prices, under the supervision of the town authorities, became common.  The Gild-Statutes further forbad working for a customer who was still indebted to a brother.  Any member becoming poor from "adventures on the sea, or the advanced price of merchandize, or by borrowing and pledging, or by any other misfortunes," might claim to be relieved in proportion to the fraternity's funds.  Even in 1723 the bye-laws of the Gild of the Joiners and Carpenters of Worcester ordained, "that whereever any freeman buys any parcel of timber or boards coming to the city to be sold, and fit for the crafts, every freeman may have a share therein, not exceeding a third, at cost price, on request, and paying ready money, under penalty of 20s. for refusing to share."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS335"><HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1>, p. 210.  Mr. Ludlow (<HI1 REND="i">The Fortnightly Review</HI1>, Oct. 1869, p. 405) very truly observes: "The spirit of this rule, as well as of that of the Berwick Gild as to sharing a load of herrings with one's neighbours, is exactly the same as that of the rules of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, requiring members who take piecework to share equally any surplus made with all members working on the job."</NOTE1>  As long as members of the Gild were out of <EPB/><PB N="cxxxii"/>work, no member was to work with non-members.  On the other hand, a member was always allowed to employ his wife, children, and maid in work; for the whole household of a Gild-brother belonged to the Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS336">This answers too the question of Mr. Toulmin Smith: "Why is he (a fuller of Lincoln) not to work at the bar in company with an ordinary woman, while he may do so with a master's wife or her handmaid?"  (Note on p. 180 of his collection.)  In Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, too, the rule is frequent, "that no one of the trade shall set any woman to work, other than his wedded wife and daughter" (for instance, pp. 216, 277, 547, &amp;c.).  Compare too Wilda, p. 329.</NOTE1>  This led unfortunately in later times to many easings to the sons of Gild-brothers in learning the trade and acquiring the freedom of the Gild, as well as to the degeneration of the Gilds into family coteries.  Another consequence of these laws was, that after the death of a Gild-brother, his widow could carry on his trade, and could remain a member of the Gild.  Even if she married again a man of the same trade who was not free of the Gild, she generally<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS337">The only exception known to me is art. vi. in the <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Poulaillers de Paris</FOREIGN>: "The wife of a poulterer may carry on the said mystery after the death of her husband, quite as freely as if her sire was alive; and if she marries a man not of the mystery, and wishes to carry it on, she must buy the (right of carrying on the) mystery, in the above described manner; as she would be obliged to buy the mystery, if her husband was of the mystery, and had not yet bought it; for the husband is not in the dominion of the wife, but the wife is in the dominion of the husband" (<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"quar li homme n'est pas en la seignorie à la fame, mès la fame est en la seignorie à l'home"</FOREIGN>).—Ouin-Lacroix, p. 747.</NOTE1> conferred on her second husband that freedom by marrying him.  If, on the other hand, she married a man who did not belong to the same trade, she was excluded from the Gild during that wedlock.  The same brotherly spirit gave rise also to laws forbidding insults and ill-usage among Gild-brothers; to the prohibition to appear before a court of justice for disputes about debts and other matters, unless every transaction had first been examined by the Gild-wardens, and every compromise proved impossible; and also to a series of other rules referring to their domestic conduct<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS338">For instance, "that no man of the fraternite take his neyghbor's house yt is of the same fraternite, or enhaunce the rent against the wille of the foresaid neighbor." —Herbert, vol. i. p. 49; compare also Berlepsch, vol. v. p. 18, vol. ix. p. 21.</NOTE1>among each other, and the prevention of unneighbourly tricks. The Gild-Statutes also, in conformity with the spirit of the times, often contain sumptuary laws for the members, and especially with reference to apprentices.  As the Craft-Gilds did duty also as divisions of the military forces of the town, we find in their statutes many articles<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS339">Wilda, p. 340.  The Statutes of the <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Débiteurs de bois</FOREIGN> of Gant declare: <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Tout membre qui ne se rend pas en armes sous la bannière du métier, quand les bonnes gens de Gand se réunissent en équipage de guerre, forfaira le prix de plusieurs jours de travail pour chaque fois."</FOREIGN>—Moke, vol. i. p. 196.  Compare also the Statutes of the <SOCALLED>"Spinnwetter"</SOCALLED> at Bâle, 1271, Berlepsch, vol. ix. p. 21.</NOTE1> referring to this matter; and <EPB/><PB N="cxxxiii"/>brilliant were the victories which some of the Gilds gained under their trade banners.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS340">For instance, the Journeymen Bakers of Munich at Ampfing, 1322 (Berlepsch, vol. vi. p. 151), the Butchers of Liège at Steppes, 1213 (Moke, vol. ii. p. 66), the Furriers of Brussels at the siege of Malines, 1303 (Ibid. p. 124), above all, the Flemish Weavers at Courtrai, 1302 (Ibid. p. 146), &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE1>  Naturally enough, the Craft-Gilds were not deficient in that element essential to all Gilds, the common meal, which in later times was held in their sometimes magnificent hall.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS341">We have an account of the Tailors' Hall in London existing already in the time of Edward III. (Herbert, vol. i. p. 87).</NOTE1></P><P>The Gild, which, as we have shown, stood like a loving mother, providing and assisting, at the side of her sons in every circumstance of life, cared for her children even after death; and the ordinances as to this last act breathe the same spirit of equality among her sons on which all her regulations were founded, and which constituted her strength.  In cases of insolvency at death, the funerals of poor members were to be equally respected with those of the rich.</P><P>Besides being brotherhoods for the care of the temporal welfare of their members, the Craft-Gilds were, like the rest of the Gilds, at the same time religious fraternities.  In the account of the origin of the Company of Grocers<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS342">Herbert, vol. i. pp. 43-45.</NOTE1> it is mentioned that, at the very first meeting, they fixed a stipend for the priest, who had to conduct their religious services, and to pray for their dead. In this respect the Craft-Gilds of all countries are alike; and in reading their statutes, one might fancy sometimes that the old craftsmen cared only for the well-being of their souls.  All had particular saints for patrons, after whom the society was frequently called; and where it was possible, they chose one who had some relation to their trade<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS343">For the names of the saints in certain trades, see Brand's <HI1 REND="i">Popular Antiquities</HI1>, vol. i. p. 202, ed. 1841. (Note of F. J. F.)</NOTE1>.  They founded masses, altars, and painted windows in cathedrals; and even at the present day their coats of arms and their gifts range proudly by the side of those of kings and barons.  Sometimes individual Craft-Gilds appear to have stood in special relations to a particular church,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS344">Compare the London Saddlers (Herbert, vol. i. p. 16); but their Gild was probably a purely religious one; see also the Fullers of Lincoln and their relation to the deanery of that city (Mr. T. Smith's collection, p. 179); and the Craft-Gilds at Bâle and their relation to the cathedral (Berlepsch, vol. ii. p. 18, vol. v. p. 18, vol. ix. p. 19).</NOTE1>by virtue of which they had to perform special services, and received in return a special share in all the prayers of the clergy of that church.  In later times the Craft-Gilds frequently went in solemn procession to their churches.  We find innumerable <EPB/><PB N="cxxxiv"/>ordinances also as to the support of the sick and poor; and to afford a settled asylum for distress, the London Companies early built dwellings near their halls.  The chief care however of the Gildmen was always directed to the welfare of the souls of the dead.  Every year a requiem was sung for all departed Gild-brothers, when they were all mentioned by name; and on the death of any member, special services were held for his soul, and distribution of alms was made to the poor, who in return had to offer up prayers for the dead, as is still the custom in Roman-Catholic countries.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS345">Thus, for instance, in the Statutes of the Fullers of Lincoln it is said (<HI1 REND="i">English Gilds</HI1>, p. 180): "When any of the bretheren and sisteren dies, the rest shall give a halfpenny each to buy bread to be given to the poor, for the soul's sake of the dead."  These alms, in order that the poor should pray for the dead, sprang from the same belief as the causing masses to be said for the souls of the departed, and there is therefore no room for Mr. Toulmin Smith's doubts and questions in his note on p. 181.</NOTE1></P><P>Sometimes we find in one and the same place a single trade, or kindred trades, organized into several Craft-Gilds; as for instance in London, two Gilds of Tanners, one without Newgate and one without Cripplegate;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS346">Herbert, vol. i. p. 31.</NOTE1> and the four Weaver Gilds at Cologne in the thirteenth century;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS347">Arnold, vol. i. p. 254, &amp;c.</NOTE1> just as is still the case with the Trade-Unions.  And like the amalgamations of Trade-Unions, which are always becoming more frequent in the present day, these different old Craft-Gilds frequently amalgamated in later times; as for instance the above-mentioned four Weaver Gilds at Cologne in 1396, and the Fullers and Shearmen of London in 1527.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS348">Herbert, vol. ii. p. 654.</NOTE1>  Like the Trade-Societies embracing all England, and even more, and like the early German Town-Confederations, these Gild-Unions in some trades were extended over whole countries. Thus we gather from the charter of the Tailors of Schweidnitz in 1361, that they formed a union of the tailoring trade in twenty-five Silesian towns.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS349">Berlepsch, vol. ii. p. 230.</NOTE1>  And in the middle of the fourteenth century the various Cutlers' Gilds in Germany were united into four great fraternities, at Augsburg, Munich, Heidelberg, and Bâle, by whom all great differences, which could not be settled by the separate Gilds or their presidents, were legally decided.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS350">Berlepsch, vol. vii. p. 123.</NOTE1>  But the most renowned of these confederations was that of the various building-lodges of Germany.  It was brought about in 1452 by Dolzinger, chief-master at the building of Strasburg Cathedral; and in 1454 common statutes were discussed and passed at a general meeting at Ratisbon, and were revised and confirmed on several other lodge days.  In accordance <EPB/><PB N="cxxxv"/>with these statutes, four central lodges were created, Strasburg, Cologne, Vienna, and Zurich, each with a separate district. Strasburg, however, had the precedence.  The overseer of the cathedral works was Grand-Master of the Stonemasons' fraternity, and according to its code, confirmed by the Emperor Matthias in 1613, he was even then still considered as "chief judge of stonework." Even in the eighteenth century the Masters of the Stonemasons' lodge at Strasburg demanded a goldfinch from the lodge at Rochlitz as a token of its dependence.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS351">Berlepsch, vol. viii. pp. 186, 187.</NOTE1>  And as late as 1789, the Vienna lodge administered justice throughout the whole of its district, awarded punishment, and so forth.  This union of the workmen in the building trades was followed by others amongst kindred or technically-identical crafts, especially amongst those which, on account of the trifling demand for their wares, could not exist in small towns at all, and only in limited numbers in large towns, as for instance the Locksmiths and Sword-cutlers.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS352">Pölitz and Bülau, 1842, vol. ii. pp. 341-343.</NOTE1>  The central societies were in the capitals, the branches in the small towns.  Three masters in any one of the confederated towns formed a corporation, whose acts, if they were in conformity with the acts and statutes of the central society, were legally recognized by the other confederated societies.  As the branch societies were subordinated to the central one, they were always obliged to send a couple of deputies to the meetings which took place at the abode of the central society; and to give there the accounts of their branches.  At these meetings the common good of the Gild was discussed; and all concerns which could not be regulated by the branches were settled.  Sometimes even the branches and central societies divided their money proportionately amongst themselves.  The central societies of several crafts were at Nürnberg; and masters from all parts of Germany—and even from Courland and Livonia—there purchased freedom and master's credentials, and got their apprentices enrolled; as, for instance, the Combmakers, Filecutters, Brushmakers, Coppersmiths, &amp;c.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS353">Ortloff, <FOREIGN>Recht der Handwerker</FOREIGN>, pp. 82, 83.</NOTE1>  I would not enter into all these details, were it not for their great similarity to the circumstances of some Trade-Unions of the present day, for instance, the Amalgamated Engineers.</P><P>Though in the preceding paragraph I have spoken partly of very late times, yet one relation, namely, that between workmen and masters <HI1 REND="i">before</HI1> the degeneration of the Craft-Gilds, has not yet been touched on at all.  The facts recorded concerning it, before the <EPB/><PB N="cxxxvi"/>middle of the fourteenth century, are extremely meagre.  They consist entirely of prohibitions against engaging the servant of another before the expiration of his servitude, or so long as his former master had a claim on him; of regulations as to the number of servants allowed to a master; of punishments incurred by masters who kept back their servants' wages; and lastly, of the ordinance that all disputes between masters and servants should be decided by the wardens of the Gild.  Servants' wages also were probably at that time fixed by the wardens.  This slight notice of servants in the accounts of the early Craft-Gilds may however be sufficiently explained by the character of handicrafts in that age.  They were for the most part merely local trades, and were mostly, if not entirely, carried on by natives of the towns, as many Gild-Statutes expressly declare.  A great influx of labour, and an overstocking of the trade with hands, were therefore impossible. Moreover, the Gilds were not yet close corporations, and in the then state of handicraft a large capital to carry it on as a master was not required.  And if we consider, finally, that from the frequently recurring restriction of a master to only one servant,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS354">For instance, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Chandeliers de Rouen, rédigés en 1360</FOREIGN>, Ouin-Lacroix, p. 589.</NOTE1> a very insignificant number of them must be inferred, and that many Gild-Statutes do not even mention servants at all, but only apprentices, it appears very probable that the majority of apprentices would, as soon as their apprenticeship had expired, practise their handicraft on their own account, and that only a few would work as servants, and these merely for a time. Of a real working-class, with separate interests and ideas, there was therefore at that time no question at all.  We meet with an exception to this rule only in the cloth manufactures of the Belgian towns, which were carried on on a larger scale and for an extended market.  Here servants took part, as delegates of their class, even in the supervision of labour,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS355">Moke, vol. ii. p. 108: <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"A Ypres, nous voyons les valets admis à partager la surveillance du travail.  Ce dernier règlement, qui date de 1280, divise ainsi les inspecteurs: il y aura dans la ville d'Ypres deux voies (c'est-à-dire deux inspections), l'inspection du nord et l'inspection du sud.  Dans chacune six maîtres et trois valets."</FOREIGN></NOTE1> gave their consent to the ordinances for regulating the trade, and received their pay in a definite proportion to that of their masters. In some places, as at Bruges, the servants received a real share in their masters' profits.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS356"><P>Moke, vol. ii. p. 99, says, speaking of the <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Anciennes Ordonnances d'Ypres"</FOREIGN>of 1280: <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Voici dans quelles proportions s'y trouvent calculés les salaires du maître et du valet dans le métier des tondeurs:—</FOREIGN> <TABLE><ROW><CELL><FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Le Maître.</FOREIGN></CELL><CELL><FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Le Valet.</FOREIGN></CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>12</CELL><CELL>8</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>10</CELL><CELL>8</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>6</CELL><CELL>5</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>26</CELL><CELL>22</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>—</CELL><CELL>—</CELL></ROW><ROW><CELL>54</CELL><CELL>43</CELL></ROW></TABLE><FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Les règlements du métier des Tisserands à Bruges (p. 14) ordonnent que de cinq deniers le maître en ait trois, le valet deux (or le maître fournissait le métier et le local).</FOREIGN></P><P><FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Plusieurs ordonnances règlementaires portent pour clause, 'du consentement des maîtres et des valets.'"</FOREIGN></P></NOTE1>  Even where the supervision of woollen <EPB/><PB N="cxxxvii"/>manufactures was entirely in the hands of patricians, no regulations were framed without the servants having been previously heard.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS357">Thus at Brussels, see Moke, vol. ii. p. 108.</NOTE1></P><P>Such harmonious relations, however, cannot be inferred from the accounts we have after the middle of the fourteenth century; and this, it appears to me, was in consequence of the degeneration of the Craft-Gilds, which in certain places and in certain trades commenced with the fourteenth century.  We must not forget that these Gilds were not unions of labourers in the present sense of the word, but of persons who, with the help of some stock, carried on their craft on their own account.  The Gild contests were, consequently, not contests for acquiring political equality for labour and property, but for the recognition of political equality of trade-stock and real property in the towns. These contests, therefore, nowhere led to a participation of the masses in the government; but in the place of an oligarchy of landed proprietors, an oligarchy of capitalists stept in.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS358">Arnold, vol. ii. p. 292, &amp;c.</NOTE1>  If originally the capital required for carrying on a craft was but insignificant, and was possessed by the majority of the lower classes of the townsmen, so that the possession of small capital did not characterize the Gild in a higher degree than labour, yet this state of things was changed with the advance and flourishing of trade, and the increase of riches amongst craftsmen.  But in proportion as a trade advanced and acquired wider markets, it afforded greater opportunities for the employment of capital; and in the same proportion the Craft-Gild changed from a society for the protection of labour, into an opportunity for the investment of capital.  But at the same time this rise in the moneypower of the Gilds—and especially of the cloth manufactures—drew the villeins in masses into the towns and into the trades.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS359">Compare Eden, <HI1 REND="i">State of the Poor</HI1>, vol. i. pp. 30, 43, 57, 61.</NOTE1>Concern for the productiveness of their investments aroused the spirit of monopoly in the craftsmen, and called forth a multitude <EPB/><PB N="cxxxviii"/>of restrictions on the competition of the new aspiring families.  The entrance-fees were raised; and on the Continent arose the custom of requiring a costly masterpiece from every outsider who wanted leave to carry on a craft on his own account, whilst entrance was made easy to the sons and sons-in-law of members, as well as to those who married a widow belonging to a Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS360">Ouin-Lacroix, p. 651—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Éperonniers de Rouen en 1358</FOREIGN>, art. xi. p. 655; <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Filassiers et Filassières de Rouen, 1358 et 1394</FOREIGN>, art. xvi., &amp;c.</NOTE1>  At Bremen, where, it appears, shoes were made for a larger market, as early as A. D. 1300, the membership of the Gild among the Shoemakers was inherited by both sons and daughters; and every one who became master had to pay a quarter of a mark.  In 1308 it was decreed in that town that whoever was not born in the Gild, must before entering it be possessed of a fortune of eight marks free of debt.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS361">Berlepsch, vol. iv. pp. 32, 34.</NOTE1> At Tournay<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS362">Ouin-Lacroix, p. 749—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Tisserands de Tournay en 1365</FOREIGN>, art. ii.: <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Un usurier ne pourra exercer le métier de tisserand."</FOREIGN></NOTE1>it became necessary as early as 1365 to forbid usurers carrying on the Weavers' trade.  The capitalist character of the Gild became preponderant to such an extent, that proof of the possession of capital, or of a house in which the trade was to be carried on,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS363">Berlepsch, vol. vi. pp. 126, 127.</NOTE1> was frequently made a requisite for a candidate's admission.

Even the requisite of spotless honour for admission was abused by the Gild-meetings in order to keep off competition, for they had the right of refusing admittance to anybody.

Sometimes the richer craftsmen withdrew from their poorer brethren into separate Gilds, as, for instance, the Shoemakers from the Cobblers, the Tanners from the Shoemakers;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS371">Berlepsch, vol. iv. p. 41, &amp;c.; Ouin-Lacroix, p. 748—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Tanneurs de Sens</FOREIGN>, 1375, art. x.</NOTE1>and we frequently hear of disputes among the Craft-Gilds concerning what belonged to their trade.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS372">Berlepsch, ibid.; Riley, <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, pp. 156-162; Herbert, vol. i. p. 104.</NOTE1>  The Emperor Sigismund also complains, in 1434, in his <HI1 REND="i">Secular Reformation</HI1>,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS373">Goldasti, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Constitutiones Imperiales</FOREIGN>, vol. iv. p. 189, cap. iv.</NOTE1> that membership of the Gilds had then to be "grossly bought," that in the town council the crafts followed with partiality their own advantage only, to the public detriment; and he believes that the only remedy would be their abolition.  Similar abuses of the craftsmen perhaps contributed to the ordinance requiring returns as to the aims, constitution, statutes and means of the Gilds, <EPB/><PB N="cxl"/>in 12 Richard II., to which we are indebted for most of the documents contained in Mr. Smith's collection.  At least, complaints against the Gilds were at other times the occasion for such inquiries.  Thus, in the case of the London Weavers in 14 Edward II., and later in 1437, 15 Henry VI., on a petition<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS374">Herbert, vol. i. pp. 106, 107.</NOTE1>of the Commons to the king declaring that the Craft-Gilds abused the privileges granted to them by enacting ordinances hurtful to the common profit of the people; and in our time also we have seen, from the same cause, something similar in the Royal Commission on Trade-Unions.  The Act which followed in consequence of the petition in 1437, the 15th Henry VI. c. 6, 7, ordained, besides the returns just mentioned, "that they [the Gilds] should not make or use any ordinance in disparity or diminution of the franchises of the king or others, or against the common profit of the people, nor allow any other ordinances without their being first approved and enrolled before such Justices of the Peace, and that the same should be by them afterwards revoked and recalled, if not found to be wholly loyal and reasonable," &amp;c.</P><P>The last-mentioned restrictions in the Craft-Gilds at a time—the middle of the fourteenth century—when the villeins were rushing in great numbers into the towns to take up trades, must have prevented a great number, and in several trades the majority, of workmen, from themselves becoming independent masters; and thus there arose a real working-class, with separate views and interests.  Whilst the statutes before the fourteenth century frequently do not even mention the workmen, after the middle of the fourteenth century it became absolutely necessary to regulate their relations to their masters.  Above all things, the provisions for the settlement of disputes between masters and workmen which recur in all countries, are striking, as well as the care that both masters and workmen should fulfil their obligations to each other.  The deciding authorities were here always the wardens of the Gild.  Masters who withheld from the workmen the wages to which they were entitled were compelled to pay by the Gild authorities.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS375">Riley, <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, p. 306—Articles of the Alien Weavers, 1362:  "If any workman has served his alien master by the day or by the week, and the said master will not pay the workman for his work, according as they shall have agreed, the good folks who shall be ordained or sworn to keep and rule the said trade, shall have power to forbid the said master to be so daring as to work at the said trade until he shall have paid his workman what he is bound to pay him.  And if he shall do the contrary, and be convicted thereof, let him pay to the chamber the penalty that is underwritten."  See also Ibid. p. 512—Ordinances of the Founders, 1389, and others.  The Gild-Statutes of the Continent show the same fact, for instance, Ouin-Lacroix, p. 748—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Tailleurs de Montpellier en 1351</FOREIGN>, art. xi.: <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Si quelque maitre ne faisait pas justice à ses ouvriers en leur refusant leur salaire, il sera tenu de les satisfaire à l'arbitrage des maîtres."</FOREIGN>  Art. xii.: <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Si quelque ouvrier obligé envers quelq'un des maîtres, ne voulait s'acquitter à l'arbitrage des autres maîtres, nul des maîtres ne lui donnera plus d'emploi."</FOREIGN>  See also Ibid. p. 740—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Forgerons, &amp;c., en Normandie, 1405</FOREIGN>, art. i., and many other Gild-Statutes.</NOTE1>  On the other hand, "if any serving man shall <EPB/><PB N="cxli"/>conduct himself in any other manner than properly towards his master, and act rebelliously towards him, no one of the trade shall set him to work until he shall have made amends before the mayor and aldermen, and before them such misprision shall be redressed."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS376">See Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>—Ordinances of the Whittawers, 1346 (p. 232); Braelers, 1355 (p. 277); Founders, 1389 (p. 512); Brasiers, 1416 (p. 624), &amp;c.</NOTE1>  In the case of the Tailors of Vienna the rule became necessary that "no workman shall be allowed to leave his master fourteen days before a festival," that is, at a time when there would be the greatest demand for work.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS377">Berlepsch, vol. ii. p. 229.</NOTE1>  Among the Tailors of Silesia we find that in 1361 the system of journeymen travelling in search of work was already completely organized.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS378">Ibid. pp. 230-233.</NOTE1>  Some of the Continental statutes—probably with the object of restricting competition—made it a requisite of mastership that every one should have worked as a journeyman for a certain number of years.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS379">See, for instance, Ouin-Lacroix, p. 735—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Statuts des Boulangers d'Arras en 1372</FOREIGN>, art i.</NOTE1>  Moreover, all journeymen were strictly forbidden to work on their own account;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS380">See, for instance, Ouin-Lacroix, p. 748—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Tailleurs de Montpellier en 1351</FOREIGN>, art. xiii.</NOTE1> and, where they were allowed to marry, their wives were forbidden to work.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS381">For instance, Ouin-Lacroix, p. 584—Cardiers de Rouen en 1397, art. xii. p. 675; Gaîniers de Rouen en 1402, art. xiii.</NOTE1>  These workmen had also frequently to become members of the Gild, and had to pay contributions.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS382">See Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, p. 547—Articles of the Leathersellers, 1398; Ouin-Lacroix, <FOREIGN>Tailleurs de Montpellier en 1351</FOREIGN>, art. ii.</NOTE1>But a great difference was evidently made between the workman who had no prospect of becoming a master, and the apprentice who took to the trade with that view.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS383">For instance, Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, p. 570—Articles of the Bladesmiths, 1408: "And that no one of the said trade shall teach his journeymen the secret of his trade, as he would his apprentice, on the pain aforesaid."</NOTE1>  Besides also, we meet with beneficent regulations in favour of the workmen. Thus, for instance, the articles of the Braelers<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS384">Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, p. 277.</NOTE1> decree: "If any serving man of the said trade, who has behaved himself well and loyally towards his masters whom he has served, shall fall sick, or be unable to help or maintain himself, he shall be found by the good folks of the said trade until he shall have recovered and be able to help and maintain himself."</P><EPB/><PB N="cxlii"/><P>The plague of 1348, and the consequent depopulation, brought the opposition between the interests of the working-class and the employers for the first time on a large scale to a crisis.  As the clergy took advantage of the small number of those who could say masses and prayers in conformity with the intentions of the faithful in order to increase their fees, and as merchants and tradesmen took advantage of the small supply of wares to raise their prices, in like manner the workmen endeavoured to use, for a general rise in wages, the distress into which the propertied class had been plunged through the universal dearth of labour.  The consequences of this were the notorious Statutes of Labourers (23 and 25 Edward III.), in which it was ordained for workmen in general, but especially for agricultural labourers and those employed in the building trades, that no workman should take more, and no employer should give more, than had been customary before the plague.  It has become the fashion in our time to represent these wage-regulations as a policy contrived for the oppression of the labourer, and this especially in explanations to working-men asking for legal regulations of wages,—as they frequently did towards the end of the last century and in the beginning of the present,—of the superior value of modern legislation for the working-class.  To give such a character to these statutes is however, in my judgment, a complete misrepresentation of the real state of the case.  These regulations of wages were but the expression of the general policy of the Middle Ages, which considered that the first duty of the State was to protect the weak against the strong, which not only knew of rights, but also of duties of the individual towards society, and condemned as usury every attempt to take unseemly advantage of the temporary distress of one's neighbour.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS385">From this policy sprang indeed all mediæval price-regulations of wares, and especially of provisions, as well as the severe punishments and the frequent and wellmeant, though mistaken, prohibitions of the engrossing of goods to re-sell them at higher prices in times of dearth.</NOTE1>  According to Knighton, there existed at the time of the plague such distress and such general loosening of the bonds of society as is only to be found in the descriptions of earthquakes in South America.  Whole villages died out; houses fell into ruins; nobody would work except for enormous wages.  In consequence of this, whole flocks perished for want of herdsmen, and the corn-crops, which were unusually rich that year, perished on the ground, as no reapers could be found.  All existing relations threatened to become dissolved.  To this was added an incursion of the Scots; and then the king, in order to bring something like order into the chaos, and to save the State and society from destruction, issued the ordinance which compelled the labourers to <EPB/><PB N="cxliii"/>work for fixed wages.  In order to have something like a fixed standard, he naturally reverted to the scale of wages which existed before the plague.  But ordinances of this kind were by no means directed against the labourers alone, for similar measures struck at all who in a similar spirit of usury would enrich themselves from the general misery, like those clergy who claimed larger fees for their prayers and masses, and like those merchants and tradesmen who raised the price of their goods.  The purpose of the law, to protect especially the weak, may also be seen in the punishments which the rich incurred who paid higher wages, thereby raising the general rate, and thus preventing poorer men from hiring labourers.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS386">See Knighton's Chronicle in <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Historiœ Anglicanœ Scriptores decem</FOREIGN>, pp. 2599-2601.

These endeavours of the labourers to raise wages of course showed themselves first and most strongly in the trades in which, as in the cloth manufactures,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS390">In later times a Truck Act was also first required for the cloth manufacture, that of 4th Edward IV. c. 1 (1464-5).</NOTE1> the new development had progressed the farthest, and in which there existed a large working-class.  Thus we find, in the year 1350, a petition<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS391">Riley, p. 251.</NOTE1> from the Master-Shearmen to the City authorities of London, in which they complain that they could no longer have journeymen at the same rate of wages as formerly; that "now the men will not work otherwise than by <EPB/><PB N="cxliv"/>the cloth, and then so greatly hurry over the same, that they do great damage to the folks to whom such cloths belong;" and that therefore the old customs should be re-established under penalties.  One of their ordinances in the same year<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS392">Riley, p. 247.</NOTE1> shows that the journeymen in disputes between a master and his workmen had "heretofore" already availed themselves generally of strikes as a means of procuring satisfaction for their fellow-workers; it was therefore "ordained that from henceforth, if there be any dispute moved between any master and his man in the said trade, such dispute shall be settled by the warden of the trade." If the workman did not submit to the warden, he was "to be punished by the mayor and aldermen at their discretion."  The statutes of the Alien Weavers of 1362<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS393">Ibid. p. 306.</NOTE1> contain the same enactment verbatim.</P><P>Accounts at that time of strikes in the building-trade are particularly numerous; and this is easily explained by the peculiar circumstances of this trade, which differed from all others. The trade appears to have been of a twofold kind.  When cathedrals and palaces were built, there was but one master—the architect of the present day.  Between him and the workmen there were masters and foremen answering to the masters and foremen of modern factories.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS394">See in Berlepsch, vol. viii. pp. 194-209, the Code of the Rochlitz Stonemasons of 1462, which was formed after that of Strasburg; also Ouin-Lacroix, p. 227, &amp;c.</NOTE1>  The "lodge"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS395">The German word is <FOREIGN>"Hütte."</FOREIGN>  It meant as well the workshop as the place of meeting, which in those days were identical.—The seemingly different meaning of the word <HI1 REND="i">lodge</HI1> in early (as in modern) England has been noticed above, p. cxxxix, note 1.  Compare too from the same <HI1 REND="i">Constitutions of Masonry</HI1>, p. 22, of the apprentice's duty:—<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L>"The prevystye of the chamber telle he no mon,</L><L>Ny yn the <HI1 REND="i">logge</HI1> whatsever they done;</L><L>Whatsever thou heryst, or syste hem do,</L><L>Tell hyt no mon, whersever thou go."</L><BIBL>—(l. 279-282.  F. J. F.)</BIBL></Q1></NOTE1> itself of the architect was very similar to our factories; it consisted of one or more workshops in which the workmen worked together; and the part of the Code of the Rochlitz Stonemasons referring to the workmen, bears a perfect resemblance, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">mutatis mutandis</FOREIGN>, to our factory rules.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS396">Berlepsch, vol. viii. pp. 204-209.</NOTE1>  In the building of dwelling-houses, however, it appears to me that the owner himself conducted the work, that he engaged both masters and workmen, and that the masters stood to him in the same intermediate position as the foremen above mentioned.  Hence we find in the legal regulation about wages, special directions how much wages the masters in the <EPB/><PB N="cxlv"/>building trades were to receive;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS397">See Riley, p. 253—Wage-regulations of the City of London; also the 25th Edward III. c. 2, as well as the 34th Edward III. c. 9.</NOTE1> and it was frequently defined how much the master might retain of the wages which were paid to him for the workmen,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS398">Berlepsch, vol. viii. p. 171.</NOTE1> or that he should deduct nothing for himself.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS399">Ibid. p. 197, art. 9.</NOTE1>  Sometimes also they undertook such buildings in gross, i. e. by contract4, as is proved by the statutes of the London Masons of 1356.  Thus these old building-trades show a great similarity in their institutions to those of our modern Great-Industry; there were fewer persons who carried on the trade on their own account, and a greater number of dependent workmen, than in the other trades; and the last-mentioned ordinances point to relations, such as are still greatly abhorred by workmen of the present day.  Naturally, those relations led then to the same differences between workmen and their employers as they lead now.  Thus in England the "Royal mandate as to the workmen who have withdrawn from the works at the Palace of Westminster"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS400">Ibid. p. 271.</NOTE1> tells us of a strike amongst the workmen in the building-trades; and the two laws enacted there in the Middle Ages against combinations, congregations, and chapters of workmen, the 34th Edward III. c. 9 and 3rd Henry VI. c. 1, were directed against workmen in the building-trades only.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS401">Compare, too, the Ordinances of Worcester, art. 57 (Mr. Toulmin Smith's collection, p. 397).  The Act of Henry VI. (A. D. 1424-5) mentions "the yearly congregations and confederacies made by the Masons in their general chapiters assembled."</NOTE1>  Moreover, the peculiar position of these trades is indicated by the fact that all the legal regulations of wages in the Middle Ages which are cited by Eden,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS402">Eden, <HI1 REND="i">State of the Poor</HI1>, vol. i.  See also Riley, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Liber Albus</FOREIGN>, pp. 251, 288.</NOTE1> refer—by the side of agricultural labourers—exclusively to the workmen in the building-trades. About this time also there sprung up in the building-trades in France the "compagnonnage," and for centuries it existed among workmen only employed in these trades.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS403">See Simon, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Étude historique et morale sur le Compagnonnage</FOREIGN>, Paris, 1853, p. 90, and others.  This term meant originally, says the <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Dict. de l'Académie</FOREIGN>, "the time during which a young man who had finished his apprenticeship worked at his master's before he could set up for himself.  It is used now for the union of artisans in different associations."  The latter is the sense in which it is employed in the text.</NOTE1></P><P>Though the combinations and Trade-Unions in the building-trades of that age may be explained by the altogether peculiar circumstances of these trades, and though they must therefore be considered as an exceptional phenomenon, yet, on the other hand, the rise of a class of journeymen with special interests and views must have necessitated and called forth an organization of <EPB/><PB N="cxlvi"/>them.  Accordingly, we meet on the Continent about this time with special fraternities of journeymen, which were formed after the model of the fraternities of craftsmen, just as the Craft-Gilds were after that of the Town-Gilds.  Their statutes refer to common divine service at stated times, to common meals—with a multitude of directions about maintaining order on these occasions and at other meetings—to burials, to support and nursing of the sick, to entrance-fees, contributions, &amp;c.  Every journeyman of the trade in a town had to belong to it.  We also find directions for the journeymen to do their duty faithfully to their masters, and inculcations of the rules of the Craft-Gild, as, for instance, that no one should summon another before a court of justice until a compromise had been first attempted before the wardens of their own journeymen's fraternity, and next before those of the Masters' Gild.  For these fraternities appear generally as supplements to the Masters' Gilds, providing only especially for the social and religious wants of their fellow-members of the journeyman class.  They were therefore recognized by the Masters' Gilds, and even established by their consent.  Thus the Journeymen-Bakers of Copenhagen<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS404">Wilda, p. 343.</NOTE1> founded, in 1403, a Gild in honour of St. Catherine; and we have still the ordinances of the Journeymen-Bakers at Hamburg from 1481.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS405">Berlepsch, vol. vi. p. 125.</NOTE1>  Many others, no doubt, existed besides.  In London also the same wants led the journeymen to form the same organizations.  But here the City authorities were evidently afraid of the workmen abusing their unions as a means of raising wages.  At least, in 1383 they issued a proclamation<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS406">Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, p. 480.</NOTE1> forbidding all congregations, covins, and conspiracies of workmen in general; and when, in 1387, three journeymen cordwainers, wishing to found a fraternity, combined with a Friar Preacher, in order that he might obtain for them a confirmation from the Pope, and thus secure them against the last-mentioned prohibition of the City, they were pounced down on, and carried off to Newgate, under the powers of the said proclamation, before their plan could be carried out.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS407">Ibid. p. 495.</NOTE1>  A record of 1396 shows the existence of a religious fraternity of the serving-men of the Saddlers, "called yomen."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS408">Mr. Riley observes in a note to this word, that "it possibly may have been intended as an abbreviation of the words 'young man,' equivalent to <HI1 REND="i">garcio</HI1>, and <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">valettus</FOREIGN>."  I have no doubt that this is the right explanation of the word.  The 20th Richard II. s. 1 speaks of "varlets called yeomen."  The word is identical with the German: <FOREIGN>Geselle, Junggeselle.  Junggeselle</FOREIGN> means bachelor, a word which was very often used for yeoman; see, for instance, Herbert, vol. ii. p. 652.  The reason for calling the journeymen of the craft yeomen and bachelors, was probably that they were at that time in England, as was the case in Germany, not allowed to marry before they were masters.  (On the other hand, we must recollect that Spelman, and Wedgwood after him, hold the true derivation of <HI1 REND="i">yeo-</HI1> to be the Gothic <FOREIGN>gavi</FOREIGN>, Fris. <FOREIGN>gao, gae</FOREIGN>, a district, county, village, whence Fris. <FOREIGN>gaeman</FOREIGN>, a villager.—F.)</NOTE1>  They had their <EPB/><PB N="cxlvii"/>own livery, and six governors; and had, in 1396, existed thirteen years.  But as the Masters were of opinion that this fraternity might be made the means of raising wages, it was, at the Masters' request, suppressed by the City authorities.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS409">Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, p. 542.</NOTE1>  The same ſate befell, in 1415, the brotherhood of "yomen taillours," who in like manner wore a livery, had their meetings and religious services, and lived in houses in common.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS410">Ibid. p. 609.</NOTE1>  However, in spite of this attempt at suppression, the brotherhood continued to exist; for in 1417 they petitioned the City authorities to allow them to hold religious services for the souls of their departed fellow-members on the feast of the Beheading of St. John the Baptist (August 29), and "to do other things which theretofore they had been wont to do."  We have no account as to the result of this petition, but it was most probably refused.</P><P>As a substitute for these attempts to form an independent organization of the journeymen class, the City authorities always decreed, as in the above-mentioned case of the Shearmen, "that the serving-men in the trade aforesaid should in ſuture be under the governance and rule of the masters of such trade, the same as the serving-men in other trades in the same city are wont, and of right bound, to be."  To this was added, for their protection, this precept, "that the said masters must properly treat and govern their serving-men in the trade, in such manner as the serving-men in like trades in the city have been wont to be properly treated and governed;" and at the same time the means of appeal against the decisions of the Gild-masters is given to the workmen; for it is ordained: "And that if any serving-man should in future wish to make complaint to the Mayor and Aldermen, for the time being, as to any grievance unduly inflicted upon him by the masters aforesaid, such Mayor and Aldermen would give to him his due and speedy meed of justice as to the same.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS411">Ibid. p. 542.</NOTE1>"</P><P>From the wording of these decisions, as well as of the regulations referring to workmen in the above-mentioned ordinances of the Shearmen, one might infer that the workmen in the just-named trades had not yet been under the control of the Gild-masters. But this is contradicted by the fact that in other cases the workmen were at that time generally subject to their authority; as well as by the fact that the City authorities in the year 1415 expressly reproached the wardens of the Tailors' Gild that societies <EPB/><PB N="cxlviii"/>existed among their workmen, though those workmen were subjected to the wardens' control.  It is possible, however, that in certain trades, and especially in those trades in which—as in the cloth-manufacture—there was a large working-class, the workmen, who themselves had no prospect of ever becoming masters, had up to that time not become apprentices, and did not therefore belong to the Gild; and that they were now for the first time subjected to the authority of the Gild-masters. Perhaps the following enactment of the Leathersellers refers to this: "That <HI1 REND="i">from henceforth</HI1> no one shall set any man, child or woman, to work in the same trade, <HI1 REND="i">if such person be not first bound apprentice, and enrolled in the trade</HI1>; their wives and children only excepted."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS412">Riley's <HI1 REND="i">Memorials</HI1>, p. 547—Ordinances of the Leathersellers, 1398.</NOTE1></P><P>It appears, however, that the way in which the affairs of the yeomen were regulated by the masters of the Craft-Gild, to which the yeomen now belonged as freemen on the expiration of their apprenticeship, satisfied their wants on the whole; for from thenceforth we know of no further accounts of such fraternities in London.  From two laws of Richard II. one may infer that fraternities of this kind existed in other parts of England; for one of these laws enacts, "that no varlets called yeomen" should wear liveries; the other, "that no livery should be given under colour of a Gild or fraternity, or of any other association, whether of gentry or <HI1 REND="i">servants</HI1>, or of commonalty."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS413">Herbert, vol. i. p. 60.  Compare also Eden's <HI1 REND="i">State of the Poor</HI1>, vol. i. p. 597, note.</NOTE1>The ordinances of the Gild of the Tailors at Exeter in the time of Edward IV. show, moreover, that the servants there belonged to the Gild; but the ordinances speak also of a "ffeleshyppe of the Bachelerys,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS414">Mr. Toulmin Smith's collection, p. 313.</NOTE1> which was probably a fraternity like that of the Journeymen-Bakers at Copenhagen, which we have already referred to; and it probably stood in the same relations to the Craft-Gild. But to this fellowship there belonged also "schoppe-holders," probably such as had become masters and had not yet married. One instance that masters and wardens of Gilds really protected workmen against their masters, is furnished by the "Examples of the Control by the Gild"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS415">Ibid. p. 322, No. 6.</NOTE1> contained in Mr. Toulmin Smith's collection. In the Gild of the Cordwainers of Exeter a certain number of wardens was even regularly taken from the journeymen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS416">Ibid. p. 332.</NOTE1></P><P>The degeneration of Craft-Gilds—which began, as has already been shown, so soon after they had obtained independence and authority in trade matters in the towns—progressed, after it had <EPB/><PB N="cxlix"/>once begun, with increasing rapidity.  In the fifteenth century the capitalist quality of the craftsmen becomes more and more prevalent among the requisites for obtaining membership; and ever more numerous become the restrictions by which they endeavoured to seclude themselves, and thus to make the handicrafts the monopolies of a few families.  But this was even more the case in the following centuries, and therefore Lord Bacon, speaking of these Gilds, justly describes them as "fraternities in evil."</P><P>Accordingly we find in 1503, in 19 Henry VII. cap. 7, a repetition of the restrictions on the "masters and wardens from making any new bye-laws or ordinances concerning the prices of wares and other things, for their own singular profit, until first examined and approved of by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, or King's Justices," restrictions which had been attempted in vain, as it appears, by 15 Henry VI. cap. 6.  But as the corporations, again acting contrary to this law, arbitrarily raised the entrance-fee of apprentices to 40<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1>, the Act 22 Henry VIII. cap. 40 (A. D. 1530) fixed it again at 2<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> 6<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> on becoming an apprentice, and at 3<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> 4<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> on obtaining the freedom of the Gild.  In 1536 it became even necessary to pass a law (28 Henry VIII. cap. 5) forbidding the masters of the corporations to take an oath from the apprentices that they should not carry on the trade on their own account without the masters' consent; and also forbidding them to exact sums of money for granting the freedom of the Gild.  How little these laws availed against the selfish endeavours of the Craft-Gilds to prevent apprentices from becoming masters, and thus diminish competition, is shown in the account by Stow (edition of 1720, p. 329): "It was a great matter in former times to give £10 to bind a youth apprentice; but in King James I.'s time they gave £20, £40, £60, and sometimes £100 with an apprentice.  But now these prices are vastly enhanced to £500, or £600, or £800."  In agreement with this is the account that Cromwell granted the Grocers a charter, by which they were empowered to levy a fine of £30 on a member at his admission.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS417">Herbert, vol. i. p. 183.</NOTE1>  The ordinances of the Cutlers of Hallamshire,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS418">Hunter's <HI1 REND="i">History of Sheffield</HI1>, p. 119.</NOTE1> of the sixteenth century, and of the Framework-knitters,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS419"><HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxvi. pp. 790-794.</NOTE1> of the seventeenth, show moreover, in the privileges enjoyed by the children of Gild-members, the same tendency to make the trade hereditary which prevailed among the Craft-Gilds on the Continent.</P><P>Though the last sums mentioned by Stow probably merely refer to the twelve great companies, yet the general laws under <EPB/><PB N="cl"/>Henry VIII., which have been quoted, point to such great difficulties hindering apprentices in all trades from becoming masters, that we can easily understand why they were so exasperated against strangers, who, specially allured and favoured by kings, could carry on their crafts without these hindrances.  This exasperation led to repeated insurrections of the apprentices, the first on Evil May-day 1517; another in 1586, against those foreign tradespeople who for the sake of religion had sought refuge in England;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS420">Stow, ed. 1720, p. 333.</NOTE1> and in 1641 it gave rise to a petition from the apprentices to Parliament for measures against the strangers, who took away all their prospects of independent settlement, whilst they themselves had to struggle with so many hindrances.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS421"><HI1 REND="i">The Apprentices of London Petition presented to the Honourable Court of Parliament, 1641</HI1> (British Museum):  "And first we beseech your honours to take into consideration the intolerable abuse of our apprenticeship: for where we by coercion are necessarily compelled to serve seven or eight years at least, before we can have the immunity and freedom of this city to trade in: those which are mere strangers do snatch this freedom from us, and pull the trades out of our hands, so that by these means, when our times are fully expired, we do then begin in a manner to suffer a second apprenticeship to them, who do thus domineer over us in our own trades," &amp;c.</NOTE1></P><P>In Germany also, after the sixteenth century, ordinances against the abuses of the Craft-Gildmen are met with regularly in the laws of the Empire,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS422"><FOREIGN>Reformation guter Polizei zu Augsburg</FOREIGN>, 1530, tit. 39; 1548, tit. 36, 37; <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Recessus Imperii</FOREIGN>, 1551, òò 83, 84; 1559, òò 75-80; 1566, ò 178; 1570, ò 152; <FOREIGN>Reichspolizeiordnung</FOREIGN>, 1577, tit. 15, 37, 38; <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Recessus Imperii</FOREIGN>, 1594, òò 125-127; 1654, ò 106; <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Conclusum Imperii</FOREIGN>, 1731.</NOTE1> and especially against the exclusion of whole classes of persons from the Craft-Gilds on account of pretended infamy of birth.  On admission to the Craft-Gild, real proofs of nobility—just as in the case of collegiate chapters—had to be furnished at the examination whether a candidate was worthy by his birth of the Gild or not.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS423">See Stock's article on Gilds in Pölitz and Bülau, vol. ii. 1841.</NOTE1>  In the ordinances of individual German States we meet with similar enactments against the heavy expenses on the admission of apprentices as we do in England, and which were followed by similar results.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS424">See Berlepsch, vol. ii. p. 235.</NOTE1>  As the apprenticeship did not last seven years, as in England, but only from two to four years, the Craft-Gilds, in order to diminish competition, laid the journeymen under the obligation of travelling, sometimes for five years.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS425">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 119.</NOTE1>  Moreover, after the end of the fifteenth century, the making of a masterpiece became a requisite for the right of the independent exercise of a craft.  This was a very costly article, and, after all, unsaleable, as the things required <EPB/><PB N="cli"/>were frequently altogether useless.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS426">Pölitz and Bülau, vol. ii. p. 121 (1841); Berlepsch, vol. ii. p. 239.  In England also masterpieces were sometimes required; see, for instance, the bye-laws of the Company of Framework-knitters; <HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxvi. pp. 790-794.</NOTE1>  Moreover, in spite of ordinances of individual German States to the contrary, the most luxurious inauguratory dinners<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS427">Berlepsch, vol. vi. p. 128.</NOTE1> were required, so that the few who found it possible to become masters, generally commenced business in debt.  The sons of masters, however, were exempt<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS428">Ibid. vol. iv. p. 52.</NOTE1> from all these restrictions, from the appointed term of apprenticeship and the travelling, as well as the masterpiece.  Indeed, the tyranny of these family-clubs extended itself to the most intimate relations. Whilst the journeymen were generally forbidden to marry,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS429">Ibid. vol. iv. p. 77.</NOTE1> the masters were required to be married;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS430">Pölitz and Bülau, vol. ii. p. 125 (1841).</NOTE1> and sometimes the candidate for the mastership was even obliged to point out an "honourable and virtuous" maiden as his future wife.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS431">Ibid.</NOTE1>  The descent of the bride or wife was then subjected to the same examination as that of the craftsman himself; but if the latter resolved to marry the daughter or widow of a master, special favours were in store for him.  Corporations frequently traded with their freedom,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS432">Ibid.</NOTE1> and the latter was often attached to particular houses.  Stock says very justly indeed: "A merchant's shop, a brew- or bake-house, a stall in the shambles, the workshop of a smith or shoemaker, resembled a prebend; they were only more difficult to obtain; but they were also worth more than the latter, because they were hereditary."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS433">Ibid. p. 127.</NOTE1>  In France also the Craft-Gilds, after the middle of the fifteenth century, hardened into the same narrow-mindedness as in England and Germany, with the same favours to the sons of masters as regards the term of apprenticeship and of travelling, entrance-fees and masterpieces, so that as early as 1614 the Third Estate desired the suppression of these Gilds.</P><P>The transformation of the Craft-Gilds into societies of capitalists, exercised of course also an influence on their government; and it appears altogether natural when, in the sixteenth century, we see that government entirely transferred into the hands of the richer Gild-Members.  The Gild-Members were at that time in England divided into three classes: the livery, to which the richer masters were admitted; the householders, to which the rest of the masters belonged; and the journeymen belonging to the Gild, who were simply called "freemen," sometimes also "yeomanry" or "bachelors."  Instead of the former sovereign meeting of all Gild-Associates, there now appeared a "Court of Assistants," who governed the Gild and enacted its ordinances. <EPB/><PB N="clii"/>The first legal appointment of a Court of Assistants is met with under Philip and Mary.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS434">Herbert, vol. i. p. 118.</NOTE1>  After the time of James I., the transfer of the elective franchise from the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"communitas"</FOREIGN> to the courts of the companies became general in the charters; and in this manner, what had hitherto existed merely on sufferance became legal.  The king appointed the first members of the court for life.  As these withdrew or died off, the court itself filled up the number from former Masters and Wardens. But these it likewise chose from amongst the liverymen.  To the rest of the Gild-Members, election-day briefly meant the day on which they assembled in the Gild-hall to hear the names of the elected proclaimed.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS435">Ibid. vol. ii. p. 652, &amp;c.</NOTE1>  An oath was also introduced for all members, in which they swore to obey the Master and Wardens and their ordinances.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS436">Ibid. vol. i. p. 188, &amp;c.</NOTE1>  Refractoriness towards the Gild, violation of its laws, refusal to accept office if elected,—these were punished as formerly.  The charitable regulations also remained the same as in former times.</P><P>The transfer of the centre of force from the Meetings of all the Gild-Associates to the Court of Assistants was not always effected without opposition from at least a part of the members, as is proved by a pamphlet of the year 1649 on the Constitution of the Clothworkers' Company, the successors of the old Weavers' Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS437">One copy of this pamphlet is in the Corporation Library, Guildball, and two copies in the British Museum.  In all three the title is wanting.  One of them is in the collection of pamphlets of the year 1649 given by George III. to the Museum, and has attached to it a sheet of writing-paper, on which is written in ink: <HI1 REND="i">Chitwin's Collections of ye Company of ye Clothworkers Priuilidges, Aug. 1649</HI1>.</NOTE1>  According to this pamphlet, a part of the Gild-Associates, relying on the old charters of the Gild, appear to have claimed for the whole body of the Gild-Members, both the right of electing their Wardens, as well as of framing ordinances. Against this the said pamphlet endeavours to prove, with the most arbitrary misrepresentation of the sense and the words, that the word "commonalty" in the old charters meant, not the collective body of Gild-Members, but only the Master, Wardens, and Assistants.  A glance at the charters shows at once the untenableness of this assertion.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS438"><HI1 REND="i">The Charter of the Company of Clothworkers of London</HI1>, London, printed in the year 1648 (British Museum).—During my stay in London, the same struggle was going on in the Watermen and Lightermen's Company between the masters and the men the latter being represented by the Thames Working-Lightermen and Watermen's Protection Society, as I was informed by the Secretary of this Society.</NOTE1>  The transfer of the supreme authority rested rather, as it seems, on ordinances of the Gild. However, the democratic party failed in their endeavours.</P><EPB/><PB N="cliii"/><P>The possession of large capital, which became more and more a requisite for the independent exercise of a trade, would impair more and more the prospects of workmen becoming masters, and would call forth an ever-increasing antagonism between the interests of workmen and masters.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS439">The true employer's spirit is already to be seen from the pamphlet, <HI1 REND="i">Relief of Apprentices wronged by their Masters</HI1>, London, 1689 (British Museum).</NOTE1>  It is evident that, under these circumstances, special laws and organizations became necessary for the workmen.  In Germany, where the Craft-Gilds were governed as in England, by one master and eight councillors, —except that in Germany the government did not degenerate into such an oligarchy as in England, because the collective body of Gild-Members always elected the governors,—we meet with such organizations in connection with the system of the travelling of journeymen which had become obligatory since the sixteenth century.</P><P>It was a difficult task to live in a large town, in a foreign land, with a very scanty supply of cash, until the wandering journeyman had convinced himself, after many inquiries, whether there was work to be had in the place.  At the same time it was a matter of importance to the masters living in a town to have the means of finding out whether there were journeymen in search of work, so that in case of necessity they could at once obtain hands for their workshop.  Both these wants were met when the host (<FOREIGN>Herbergsvater</FOREIGN>, father of the inn) appointed to the charge of the house of the Gild (the so-called <FOREIGN>Herberge</FOREIGN>, inn) was obliged to take in every one who could furnish proof that he was a journeyman of that particular craft.  When, then, a travelling journeyman arrived, who wanted work, the host was able to give him the necessary information, for there was in the house a list of all the masters who were in want of journeymen.  If several masters had asked for men, he who was first on the list received the first journeymen who arrived; but the master who had more journeymen, had always to give place to him who had fewer in his workshop.  Sometimes a special master or a journeyman was appointed by the Gild to look out for work for the wandering journeymen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS440">Already ordained by the <FOREIGN>Reformation guter Polizei</FOREIGN>, 1530, tit. 39.</NOTE1>  If the journeyman found no work, he received in various crafts (the so-called <FOREIGN>geschenkten</FOREIGN>, donation-giving ones) a sum of money to support him on his journey to the next town, which was called the donation (<FOREIGN>das Geschenk</FOREIGN>): this came not merely from a fund which the journeymen had formed amongst themselves for that purpose, but the masters also contributed towards it.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS441">Berlepsch, vol. iv. pp. 73, 74.</NOTE1>  There are a series of ordinances referring to cases <EPB/><PB N="cliv"/>in which a journeyman was to forfeit the donation; and as the Imperial laws<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS442">See the <FOREIGN>Reformation guter Polizei</FOREIGN>, just mentioned, and <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Conclusum Imperii</FOREIGN>, 1731, ò 7.</NOTE1> which at first forbade altogether the giving of donations (on account of the abuses connected with the system) had no effect, they were contented with restricting it.</P><P>In the more important trades in Germany this system of travelling led to the formation of special fraternities of journeymen, which so strikingly resemble the Trade-Unions, that a description of them may be of interest.  The following account is derived principally from the Statutes<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS443">Berlepsch, vol. iv. pp. 67-72.</NOTE1> of the "Shoe-servants"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS444">The German word is <FOREIGN>"Schuhknechte,"</FOREIGN> i. e. shoe-servants.  The journeymen Shoemakers were thus called in Germany up to the year 1799, when, at Nürnberg, they first got to be called <FOREIGN>"Geselle"</FOREIGN> (Berlepsch, vol iv. p. 67).</NOTE1>of Arnstadt in Thuringia in the year 1628.  As the Introduction informs us, these rules were ordained at the request of the masters of the Shoemakers' Gild of that town.  It narrates that of old the Shoe-servants had a fraternity, imposts, and some Articles; but that since these had fallen into abeyance, and the Articles had been destroyed in the great fire, the masters had decided "to get some new Articles confirmed, especially as in these evil, unquiet, and perverse times it was highly necessary to establish and maintain sound discipline and honesty in the crafts."  In the first place, an inn was established, where all wandering journeymen had to turn in.  The host was called Father; the housewife, Mother; the daughters and maid-servants, Sisters; the sons and servants, Brothers.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS445">For the identical way of naming amongst the French <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Compagnonnage,"</FOREIGN>compare Simon, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Étude sur le Compagnonnage</FOREIGN>, p. 154.</NOTE1>  To call them otherwise was an offence for which there was a fine. The greatest reverence had to be paid to the Father and Mother.  In this inn the Shoe-servants could obtain a meal for two <FOREIGN>groschen</FOREIGN> (2 1/2<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>), and a night's lodging for four <FOREIGN>pfennige</FOREIGN> (about a halfpenny). Work was also found for him here; and no wandering Shoe-servant was allowed to enter the service of a master before he had been at the inn.  The fraternity was governed by the whole body of Shoe-servants, who met every fortnight for this purpose.  Religious service was held before every meeting.  All Shoe-servants had to attend the meeting, with the exception of masters' sons who worked with their own father; for as they were not obliged to travel, the chief object of the fraternity did not concern them. But masters' sons who did not work with their father were obliged to appear.  Those who came late were fined.  Two elders presided at the meetings.  But no meetings could take place, no regulations could be framed, and no decisions come to without the <EPB/><PB N="clv"/>presence of the masters' deputies, who were elected annually. The journeymen had also their own box, containing their Articles, their seal, and whatever other documents or valuable effects the fraternity possessed.  The box was provided with two, and sometimes with three, locks, the keys of which were kept respectively by one of the elders and one of the masters, so that neither could open the box in the absence of the other.  The seal of the journeymen could only be used with the consent of the whole fraternity and the deputed masters. The opened box was the sign that the meeting had begun, just as with the Craft-Gilds. While, therefore, the box was open, all present had to remain with uncovered heads, and during such time all disrespectful conduct, as well as improper clothing, cursing and swearing,—in short, all that showed want of respect,—was severely punished. On the other hand, we find that, whilst the box was open, a social cup was handed round, to the expense of which all had to contribute.  One of the elders had to collect this, as well as the other contributions; and in case he neglected this or any other duty, he incurred punishment.  The other contributions of the members consisted in one <FOREIGN>groschen</FOREIGN> (1 1/4<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>) entrance-fee, in a fortnightly contribution of six <FOREIGN>pfennigen</FOREIGN> (about three farthings), with one <FOREIGN>groschen</FOREIGN> (1 1/4<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>) every quarter.  In return the members received support in sickness, for which, however, they had to make repayment if they were restored to health; and in the event of death they were buried at the expense of the fraternity.  All journeymen had to attend the funeral; and this was also the case when any member of a master's family died.  The Statutes contain, besides, regulations for promoting orderly conduct and good morals among the Shoe-servants. Associating with common women, playing at dice, immoderate drinking, inducing others to drink, gaming, and such-like things, were all punished.  No one was allowed to go about the streets except in decent clothes; and all who insulted or calumniated others were also punished.</P><P>Much the same were the journeymen fraternities in all trades;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS446">See Berlepsch, vol. vii. pp. 162-168; vol. ix. pp. 76-89.</NOTE1>except in the Stonemasons', for every individual master stonemason, with his journeymen, formed a fraternity.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS447">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 192.</NOTE1>  The societies of the French "compagnons" corresponded to these organizations; except that with them I know nothing of a superintendence by the masters. There were in both the same ceremonies<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS448">See in Berlepsch, vol. ii.-ix., the chapters on the journeymen and their customs; also Simon, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Sur le Compagnonnage</FOREIGN>, and Agricol Perdiguier, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Le Livre du Compagnonnage</FOREIGN>, Paris, 1857.</NOTE1> <EPB/><PB N="clvi"/>upon admission, on entering the inn, on meeting together, and so forth; and though these may be partly explained by the intention of the journeymen thus to enhance in their own eyes the importance of their state, so rich in toil, yet these ceremonies must nevertheless be considered to a great extent as absolutely absurd.  As neglect of these formalities was severely punished by the journeymen, they drew down upon themselves severe enactments from the German Imperial Legislature;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS449"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Conclusum Imperii</FOREIGN>, 1731, ò 9.</NOTE1> and in France the <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Compagnons Cordonniers et Tailleurs</FOREIGN> of Paris fell in consequence under the greater excommunication in 1648.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS450">Simon, <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Sur le Compagnonnage</FOREIGN>, p. 74.</NOTE1></P><P>Especially interesting too, with regard to modern Trade-Unions, is the Craft-Gilds' practice of punishment by <FOREIGN>Schelten</FOREIGN>, reviling, i.e. declaring any one infamous.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS451">In the early Middle Ages every creditor used to revile thus his debtor on nonfulfilment of his obligations.  See Gengler, <FOREIGN>Deutsches Privatrecht</FOREIGN>, Erlangen, 1854, p. 198.</NOTE1>  Both master and journeymen were reviled in this manner; and, indeed, on the most silly grounds, as, for example, when any one had killed a cat or touched a dead dog; so also for infringements of Gild principles, as when any one enticed away another's custom.  Indeed, whole Gilds imposed such interdicts upon each other.  Every Gild and every journeymen's fraternity kept a "black list."  In this, as well as in the testimonials of travelling journeymen, the names of the reviled were entered, so that the warning against them spread through the whole country.  As soon as the journeymen heard of the occurrence of such a reviling, they turned out of the workshop of the reviled master, or refused to work with the reviled journeyman, until these had made atonement, and were again recognized as honourable by the governing body of the Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS452">Pölitz and Bülau, 1843, vol. i. pp. 359-364.</NOTE1>  This reviling was the most severe punishment that the Gilds could inflict on refractory members; and though the strike was not then a legal means of coercion—for the Imperial laws were violently opposed to it—yet this shows that it was at least recognized as such by the employers.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS453">The possession of still greater power by the journeymen is shown by the contest between the Chapter of the cathedral at Magdeburg and the journeymen Smiths of that city, in the year 1600.  The Gild of Smiths at Magdeburg extended also over the surrounding small towns and villages; but the jurisdiction over the masters and journeymen who lived there was exercised, not by the Gild, but by the journeymen Smiths of Magdeburg.  This relation was even recognized by the government, and in the contest of 1600 the journeymen compelled it to carry out their wishes, by threatening to leave the workshops and even "to stop the masters' hammer."  Indeed, the Chapter was obliged to pay them a fine of a hundred thalers.  Pölitz and Bülau, 1843, vol. i. pp. 365-369; printed also in Berlepsch, vol. vii. pp. 72-75.</NOTE1></P><P>But frequently—as, for example, when the Gild omitted to <EPB/><PB N="clvii"/>punish a master who had infringed any of the trade customs of the journeymen, or who in their judgment was not honourable, or when the masters, by means of the local authorities, had carried a resolution which was to be entered in their book of Articles—all the journeymen of a place struck work, and then wrote to the journeymen of other districts, warning them from coming to the places of strike.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS454">Berlepsch, vol. iv. p. 77.</NOTE1>  Such occurrences took place especially at Mayence, Würzburg, Augsburg.  The most famous of them, that of the Augsburg Shoe-servants<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS455">Ibid. p. 142.</NOTE1> in the year 1726, was in fact the cause of the Imperial decree of 1731, which was directed against this and several other abuses of the handicrafts. The Imperial laws, however, were never carried out, and the decrees of the territorial princes remained ineffectual, since the handicrafts throughout the whole of Germany hung together. Further tumults on the part of the journeymen led at last to the entire suppression of their fraternities.  In many parts of Germany, however, they existed till the present century.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS456">Weisser's <FOREIGN>Recht der Handwerker</FOREIGN>, Ulm, 1823, p. 73.</NOTE1></P><P>Among all these seditions, though, I do not know one which had its origin in disputes about wages.  It was rather presumed infringements of privileges, innovations in trade customs and the like, which always produced the uprising.  In France, it is true, we already find strikes on account of wages.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS457">Ouin-Lacroix, pp. 15, 16.</NOTE1>  On the whole, however, these situations show a tolerable understanding between master and journeymen.  The special associations of journeymen are much rather supplements of the Craft-Gild-organization, than confederations directed against the masters: nowhere do we find a trace of opposition against the prevailing trade-system, as such, like we see in the quarrels between our Trade-Unions and their employers; the old disagreements seem merely like family disputes between parents and children.</P><P>But while in Germany and France the working-class was thus completely organized, and even to a certain degree governed itself under the superintendence of the masters, we must ask whether a similar state of things did not exist among English working-men?  The "Acte towchinge Victuallers and Handycraftmen," 2nd and 3rd Edw. VI. c. 15 (1549), forbids, it is true,—jointly with the conspiracies and covins of the sellers of victuals "to sell their victuals at unreasonable prices,"—all "confederacies and promises of the artificers, handicraftsmen, and labourers; not only that they should not meddle with one another's work, and perform and finish what one hath begun; but also to constitute and appoint how much work they shall do <EPB/><PB N="clviii"/>in a day, and what hours and times they shall work;" and, besides, "that they should not make nor do their works but at a certain rate."  But all regulations forbidden in this Act recur frequently in the bye-laws of companies; they therefore in no way originated in agreements of workmen only, but as much in those of masters. Moreover, whilst the word <HI1 REND="i">"labourer"</HI1> certainly does not refer to the skilled workmen of the crafts, but probably only to labourers in agriculture, the prohibition of confederacies of <HI1 REND="i">"artificers and handicraftsmen"</HI1> is directed as much against the masters as against the workmen of the crafts.  And the act forbids, in the same breath with the confederacies of the craftsmen in general, all conspiracies of "divers sellers of victuals" for raising prices.  This Act, therefore, does not refer at all to combinations similar to those of our working-men of the present day (as is the prevalent explanation), but is simply an attempt to check the increasing abuses of the Craft-Gilds, and this especially in the trades providing for men's daily wants, where such abuses would be felt most severely.  This explanation, which is at once proved by a closer examination of the Act itself, is moreover confirmed when the Act is compared with its German counterpart, the Imperial Code of Police of 1577, title 37.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS458"><FOREIGN>Reichspolizeiordnung</FOREIGN>, 1577, tit. 37—Of Crafts in general: "We have also heard as certain, that the craftsmen in their Craft-Gilds, or otherwise, conspire and combine, that no one shall sell his finished labour or work by open sale for more or less than the others; and they thus raise the prices in such sort, that those who need their labour, and wish to buy, must pay at their (the craftsmen's) pleasure, &amp;c.  We therefore declare our earnest opinion and desire, that this shall henceforth be in no way suffered by the authorities, but that they shall watch over it: where the crafts offend however against this, they shall be punished by the authorities according to circumstances, without mercy."</NOTE1>This law contains absolutely identical prohibitions; but these apply avowedly as well to the masters as to the workmen of the crafts.  But in any case, the 2nd and 3rd Edw. VI. c. 5 refers only to transitory combinations, and the existence of a regular organization of the working-class cannot be inferred from it.</P><P>The account in Stow<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS459">Stow, edit. 1720, pp. 332, 333.</NOTE1> of the rising of the London apprentices, "when some of their <HI1 REND="i">brotherhood</HI1> have been unjustly, as they pretended, cast into prison and punished," rather points to the journeymen's fraternities of the Continent.  Their outbreaks against the foreigners I have already noticed.  In the seventeenth century also they often acted as a body, and expressed their opinion on all religious and political questions of the time.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS460">See <HI1 REND="i">The Honour of London Apprentices exemplified in a brief Historical Narration</HI1>, London, 1647 (Brit.

And may we therefrom form a conclusion as to the existence of fraternities of like nature in England?  The ceremonies which were customary among the Trade-Unions in the woollen manufacture down to the thirtieth year of the present century, show such a striking similarity to those of the German fraternities of journeymen,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS466">See the customs of the German journeymen in Berlepsch, vols. ii.-ix.  The ceremonies of those Trade-Unions I found in a pamphlet avowedly written in the interests of the employers, <HI1 REND="i">Character, Object, and Effects of Trade-Unions</HI1>, London, 1834, p. 67.  They are again printed in a book by Ward (<HI1 REND="i">Workmen and Wages, at Home and Abroad</HI1>, London, 1867, p. 102), plagiarized in the most shameless manner—with a disregard of the passages which even in that pamphlet are favourable to the workman—both from the above, and from another, <HI1 REND="i">On Combinations of Trades</HI1>, London, 1831.  And this one-sided plagiarism its author then dedicated to Mr. Gladstone!!</NOTE1> that the supposition suggests itself of a derivation of those Trade-Unions from the old journeymen fraternities.  Yet I willingly admit that in <EPB/><PB N="clx"/>default of all other information on such organizations,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS467">Since I sent the above to the printer I have found among my extracts a note taken from the <HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xlix. pp. 322-324, which supplies some further information.  According to a Report of a Committee of the House in 1794, on Petitions of the Woolcombers, complaining of the use of the "Gig-mill," there existed then a club among the Woolcombers.  Out of a hundred workmen there was not one to be found who did not belong to it.  Every member had to pay contributions according to the wants of the society.  Its object was to assist journeymen travelling in search of work, when work was scarce, and to relieve the sick and to bury the dead members.  Everybody wishing to get relief must be in possession of testimonials of the society as to his proper conduct as a Woolcomber and as to his honesty.  Whoever deceived the society lost his claims to such testimonials and to relief from the funds.  The objects of this club, it is seen, were the same as those of the German <FOREIGN>Gesellenladen</FOREIGN> and the French <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">compagnons</FOREIGN>. If we add to this, that the just-quoted records of ceremonies among Trade-Unions refer to Woolcombers also, the suggestion made in the text seems greatly corroborated.  The fact that the modern Trade-Unions call the assistance given to members out of work simply "donation," the translation of the <FOREIGN>"Geschenk"</FOREIGN>of the German journeymen's fraternities, seems also worth noticing. There is however one difference to be noted.  The said Woolcombers travelled only when work was scarce, while the "wandering" of the German, and the <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Tour de France</FOREIGN> of the French journeymen, were obligatory.  This, as well as the date, make me therefore inclined to consider this Woolcombers' Club as a Trade-Union for assisting men thrown out of work by the Gig-mill, which may perhaps, however, have descended from an old journeymen's fraternity.</NOTE1> this hypothesis does not appear tenable, unless further proofs should be produced,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS468">It is remarkable that whilst there exists a rich German literature from the seventeenth century on Craft-Gilds, and especially on the position of the workmen in these Gilds, nothing on this subject is to be found in England.  Most of the authors who have written on it in Germany were professors of universities or students, who had to write a dissertation in order to take their degrees.</NOTE1> especially as in England the journeymen were never obliged by the Gild-Statutes to travel for a certain number of years, whilst in Germany and France all journeymen's associations owed their origin to this system of travelling.</P><P>As to the general position of the workmen in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and especially as to the relations between masters and men, we find from the above ordinances of the English Clothworkers, that "controversies between the livery and their apprentices were to be settled in the old way before the master at the Common Hall," and that "journeymen should make no unlawful assemblies, brotherhoods, congregations, and flockings together."  The Gild-Statutes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries further ordain regularly, that "no person of the mystery was to hire himself to a person of another mystery, where greater wages were offered; no journeyman should work with any of another fellowship, if he can be set on work by a freeman of his own art;" no member was to suffer his apprentice or servant "to buy and sell to his own use, or that of persons of other mysteries," such practice having brought masters "to an after deale and sore damage."  On the other hand, we find a <EPB/><PB N="clxi"/>series of regulations, of which the maintenance became in later times the main object of Trade-Unions.  "No person was to exercise the trade, who had not served an apprenticeship of seven years, or been instructed by his father for that term;" no member was to instruct anybody in the trade, except his male children and apprentices regularly bound; no member was to employ any workman except he were free of the company; no journeyman was to work with a non-member.  Further, "None shall lend out or put forth any of his apprentices to work with any other, because it will hinder and take away the living of free journeymen; no foreigner shall be employed before a free journeyman; no householder shall keep above two apprentices at one time, except he employ a journeyman freeman, and then he may keep three; every master, warden, and assistant may keep three;" or as in Sheffield, "No person to have more than one apprentice in his service at one time, nor to engage another before the former be in his last year, nor take any for a less term than seven years."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS469">See Herbert, vol. ii. pp. 656, 657, and vol. i. p. 191; also Hunter's <HI1 REND="i">History of Sheffield</HI1>, p. 119, and <HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxvi. pp. 790-794.</NOTE1>  Besides, other accounts of the seventeenth century show that, in the trades in which these restrictions were not maintained—either because they were not corporate, or because the 5th Eliz. c. 4 did not apply to them, or because the regulations of the Gild or the Statute were not observed—the workmen, in consequence of the abuses practised by their employers, had fallen into the very hardships for the prevention of which the Trade-Unions in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have striven to maintain those old regulations.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS470">See "The Case and Proposals of the Free Journeymen Printers in and about London, humbly submitted to consideration.  Licensed Oct. 23, 1666."  "Whereas there are at this present in and about the City of London, to the number of a hundred and forty Workmen Printers, or thereabouts, who have served seven years to the art of Printing, under lawful Master Printers, and are reduced to great necessity and temptations for want of lawful Imployment, occasioned partly by supernumerary Apprentices and Turn-overs, which have increased the number almost to twice as many on the whole, as would be sufficient to discharge all the publick and lawful work of the kingdom, The Workmen Printers above-mentioned, &amp;c. propose:  1. That no Forreigners (that is to say) such an one as has not served seven years to the art of Printing, under a lawful Master Printer, as an Apprentice, may be entertained and employed by any Master Printer for the time to come. 2. That a provision may be made to hinder the increase of Apprentices and a limitation appointed as to the number, &amp;c.  3. That no Turn-overs be received by any Master Printer, but from a Master Printer; and that no Master Printer turning over any Apprentice to another Master Printer may be permitted to take any other Apprentice in his place, till the full time of the said Apprentice so turned over be expired: for otherwise, the restraint and limitation of Apprentices will be evaded, and the number supplied by Turn-overs," &amp;c. (British Museum.) Compare also the preamble of "An Act for the good order and government of the Makers of Knives, &amp;c. and other Cutlery Wares in Hallamshire, in the county of York, and parts near adjoining" (21 Jac. I. 1624).</NOTE1></P><EPB/><PB N="clxii"/><P>As the Craft-Gilds everywhere had sunk down to mere societies for the investment of capital, and as their dividends depended entirely on the exclusion of competition, it was unavoidable that the spirit of gain should lead them to restrictions which became always more oppressive for the public.  The annoyances they caused were considerably increased by a process which, after the sixteenth century, was of frequent occurrence in all countries:  those Craft-Gilds namely, which had hitherto comprised kindred crafts, split up into several, according to the individual trades.  These then watched each other with the utmost jealousy in order to prevent encroachments on their mutual rights, and continually fought each other in endless lawsuits. Thus, for instance, the Fletchers and Bowyers in London separated themselves into two corporations in the reign of Elizabeth.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS471">See Herbert, vol. i. p. 175.</NOTE1>  One might wonder that, on the one hand, the workmen, whose position was so much deteriorated by the degeneration of the Craft-Gilds, did not at once overthrow their dominion, as the Craft-Gilds had formerly superseded the degenerated Gilds of the patricians (pp. cx, cxi above); and that, on the other hand, the State did not, in the interest of the public, take any steps towards the abolition of the Gilds, which had already been desired so often.  But as to the working-men, though their position, and especially their prospects, had been greatly deteriorated by this degeneration of the Craft-Gilds, their interest was rather a reformation, than the abolition, of those bodies.  The Craft-Gilds maintained a number of regulations, which protected the working-men, and in consequence of which their material position appears comfortable and free from cares, if compared with that of the factory hands at the beginning of this century, when these regulations no longer existed. Uprisings of working-men are therefore to be found in those days only in consequence of infringements of Gild-regulations. But as for a reformation of the Craft-Gilds according to the interests of the working-men, the latter were not powerful enough to carry it out against their masters.  These still held strongly together in their Gilds, and did not yet, as in later times (and as formerly the patricians), rival each other in weakening competition.  The State also had changed, and no longer consisted, as before, of an organization of many smaller states.  As, after the sixteenth century, the State became in all countries continually more centralized by its kings, it was not possible for the journeymen to act with the same facility as the craftsmen had acted in former times in the towns.  Moreover, <EPB/><PB N="clxiii"/>owing to the men's isolated method of working, they had not yet acquired the same feeling of solidarity, or the same consciousness of the power of masses, as our factory hands since have.  And as to the State abolishing the Craft-Gilds—kings used the bourgeoisie as a support; first, as Henry VII. in England, against the nobility;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS472">See Herbert, vol. i. p. 109.</NOTE1> and then, because they needed them for pecuniary reasons.  The capitalists had yet to attain the same dominion in the State, which in the fourteenth century they had obtained in the towns.</P><P>The first loan to the kings by the Gilds in England was made to Henry VIII.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS473">Ibid. p. 112.</NOTE1> in 1544.  Thereupon followed, under the pretence of a holy zeal for the purity of religion, the most shameless confiscation of the whole property of the Craft-Gilds in favour of the king's private purse, by 37th Henry VIII. c. 4, and 1st Edward VI. c. 14—for the donations of which this property consisted had always in Roman-Catholic times been charged with yearly payments for supporting chantries for the souls of the respective donors.  The corporations of London had to redeem their property with £18,700.  From this period the extracting of money from the trading corporations became a regular source of supply to Government.  In most manifold ways Elizabeth, and afterwards James and Charles, contrived to screw out of the Companies their wealth.  This was especially managed by the granting of patents for monopolies, and for the oversight and control of different trades, to courtiers, by which the public suffered quite as much as the Companies.  During the Civil War too, and the Commonwealth, the Companies had to suffer great exactions and oppressions.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS474">Ibid. p. 113, &amp;c.</NOTE1></P><P>But the causes of the overthrow of the Craft-Gilds arose in the bourgeoisie itself.  These causes were, the rise of large capital, and its investment in manufacture.  The 2nd and 3rd Philip and Mary already indicates the commencement.  After stating that "the rich clothiers do oppress the weavers, some by setting up and keeping in their houses divers looms, and maintaining them by journeymen and other persons unskilful; some by engrossing of looms into their hands, and letting them out at such unreasonable rents as the poor artificers are not able to maintain themselves by, and much less their wives and families; some again by giving much less wages for the workmanship of cloth than in times past, whereby they are forced utterly to forsake their occupations, &amp;c.; it is enacted that no clothier, living out of a city, burgh, or market-town, shall keep more than two looms, nor more than two apprentices," &amp;c.  In short, <EPB/><PB N="clxiv"/>the Act endeavours to protect the small masters against the competition of the rich capitalists.  But neither this Act nor all the other attempts of the corporations could restrain the process of development, which, especially in consequence of a series of technical discoveries, threw manufacture altogether into the hands of the large capitalists.  Handicrafts, and the corporations together with them, lost continually in importance, and only made themselves hated and despised in their endeavour to arrest the natural progress of events.  I need not enter into the details of these excesses of the Craft-Gilds; for as the merits of the following system consisted chiefly in these faults of the former, and as in consequence of this peculiar kind of merits the followers of the new era were not restrained by modesty from selfpraise, the Craft-Gilds' ſaults are universally known.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS475">See however the account of the London Framework-knitters' Company in Part V.</NOTE1>  These excesses caused the removal of the trades carried on under the new system, to places free from the influence of corporate control. Birmingham, Manchester, and other places of kindred note, owe to this their career of prosperity, which was soon to leave the ancient cities and boroughs far behind.  The competition of the Great-Industry rising in the new cities deprived the old corporations of their real essence, by making the attainment of their chief objects illusory, and thus turned them into mere empty shadows of their previous grandeur.  In France the sovereign people finally swept the corporations away in the night of the 4th August, 1789.  In Germany, several bureaucratic enactments brought them piecemeal to death, and the last remnants were destroyed by the North German Industrial Code of 1869.  In England they died out gradually before the newly-rising Great-Industry; and all that remains of the ancient Gilds in the Livery-companies of to-day, is the common eating and drinking.</P><P>Yet in England there grew up successors to the old Gilds, in the Trade-Unions of working-men, which, like the first Gilds of the old freemen, sprang up as a defence against the great capitalists, who, like ever the strong, competed with each other at the expense of the weak.</P></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:3.11" TYPE="section"><EPB/><PB N="clxv"/><HEAD>V. THE ORIGIN OF TRADE-UNIONS.</HEAD><P>TRADE-UNIONS are the successors of the old Gilds.  With this assertion I concluded the foregoing part of this Essay.  It is far from being a new statement.  On the contrary, friends and enemies of these associations have repeatedly, in words and print, pointed at their connection with the old Gilds, the former to justify, by this pedigree, their existence, the latter to condemn them at once by describing them as continuations of institutions considered for long, and generally, at best as antiquated.  Their enemies, by the dodge of applying to them the epithet of "long-condemned associations for the restriction of trade," generally dispensed with all further inquiries into the real results of their working.</P><P>Indeed, every reader of the foregoing pages who has ever made himself familiar with the rules of a Trade-Society, or with one of the numerous blue-books inquiring into the organization of Trade-Societies, must grant at once their similarity to the Craft-Gilds.  But notwithstanding this striking likeness, and the numberless writings on the subject of Trade-Unions, nobody has yet inquired historically how these Unions originated,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS476">Mr. Thornton's chapter <HI1 REND="i">On the Origin of Trades' Unions</HI1> (in <HI1 REND="i">The Fortnightly Review</HI1>, New Series, vol. ii. p. 688, and in his work <HI1 REND="i">On Labour and its Claims</HI1>) bears the same relation to the real origin of Trade-Unions, as Rousseau's <FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Contrat Social</FOREIGN> to the historical origin of States.</NOTE1> and how far they may really be considered as the descendants of the old Gilds.  All opinions on this point which I have yet met with are vague, and, as I am obliged to say, far from corresponding with the reality.  The most plausible theory is expounded by Mr. Ludlow in one of the best papers ever written on Trade-Unions.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS477"><HI1 REND="i">Trade-Societies and the Social Science Association</HI1>, in <HI1 REND="i">Macmillan's Magazine</HI1>, February and March, 1861.</NOTE1>  According to his idea, the first Trade-Unions originated in the capitalist-masters withdrawing from the Craft-Gild, so as "to confine it to the operative class, so that <EPB/><PB N="clxvi"/>the Gild would necessarily merge in the Trade-Society."  He accordingly says, "The Trade-Society of our days is but the lopsided representative of the old Gild, its dwarfed but lawful heir."  For the historical proof of the identity between the two, he refers to Mr. Hill's <HI1 REND="i">Account of Trade-Combinations at Sheffield</HI1>.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS478"><HI1 REND="i">Trades' Societies and Strikes.  Report of the Committee on Trades' Societies appointed by the Social Science Association</HI1>, London, 1860, p. 521.</NOTE1></P><P>Considering only the rules and restrictions prevailing in the old Craft-Gilds, and comparing them with the regulations which our modern Trade-Associations, existing only among workmen, try to enforce, one might feel inclined to accept this opinion at once.  But the fact is, that in no one single instance did such a withdrawing of the masters from the Craft-Gild, leaving it to the workmen alone, ever take place.  On the contrary, I think it more probable that the masters generally remained in the corporation, to prevent its bye-laws being enforced against them, and to annihilate its influence.  Such, at least, was the case at Sheffield—as I will show further on—or the audience of Mr. Roebuck's declamations against the United States, the still existing Cutler's Company in Hallamshire, would have consisted of the same persons as returned Mr Mundella for Sheffield! Trade-Unions are no lopsided representatives of the old Gilds; they are complete Gilds themselves, as well as the Town-Gilds and Craft-Gilds.  And when calling them the successors of the old Gilds, I did not mean to designate them as continuations of the Craft-Gilds, nor do I think that their descent from these now certainly antiquated societies could justify their existence.  But if I succeed in proving that wherever we find in a trade the first formation of such unions among the workmen, and if, wherever more detailed records of their origin are extant, we see them arising under the same circumstances and for the same objects as the Frith-Gilds and Craft-Gilds previously arose, that is, under the breaking-up of an old system, and among the men suffering from this disorganization, in order that they may maintain independence and order, I think that this, together with the identity of their organization with that of the Gilds, will not only justify me in calling the Trade-Unions the successors of the latter, but will justify as well the existence of the Unions, as I shall then have proved that certain circumstances of disorganization, if unchecked by stronger restrictions,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS479">The want of a similar growth of Trade-Societies on the Continent must be accounted for by the military sway prevailing there at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, which suppressed all kinds of meetings and unions, and by the absence of a similar disorganization of trade to that which prevailed at that time in England.</NOTE1> call forth necessarily in <EPB/><PB N="clxvii"/>all times the same organizations into Gilds.  Indeed, in our time of physical and economical law-making, one might call this a historical law.</P><P>Our inquiry makes it necessary that we should first of all represent to ourselves the regulations of the Statute of Apprentices, the 5th Elizabeth, c. 4, which codified the order existing for centuries among the Craft-Gilds, and applied it to all the trades of its time.  There were indeed combinations and associations similar to Trade-Societies already before 1562.  But, as I have shown in Part IV., they were but exceptions, occurring chiefly in the building-trades.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS480">See p. cxliv, above.</NOTE1>  And the very fact of their occurring in the building-trades in the Middle Ages, is another proof of the justness of the theory which I am going to put forward in these pages; for these trades resembled entirely our modern manufactures, with their small number of masters and their masses of workmen, with sub-contractors, and deductions from wages.  And as to the 2nd and 3rd Edw. VI. c. 15, it has been shown above<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS481">See pp. clvii, clviii.</NOTE1> that this statute refers, not to associations of journeymen like our Trade-Societies, but to the abuses of craftsmen in general.</P><P>According to the 5th Eliz. c. 4, no one could lawfully exercise, either as master or as journeyman, any art, mystery, or manual occupation, except he had been brought up therein seven years, at least, as an apprentice.  Every householder dwelling in a city. town-corporate, or market-town, might take apprentices for seven years at least.  But only those youths might be taken as apprentices whose parents possessed a certain fortune; and none could be bound but those who were under twenty-one years of age.  Whoever had three apprentices must keep one journeyman; and for every other apprentice above three, one other journeyman. As to journeymen, it was enacted that, in most trades, no person should retain a servant under one whole year, and no servant was to depart or be put away but upon a quarter's warning.  The hours of work were fixed by the Act to about twelve hours in summer, and from the day-dawn till night in winter.  Wages were to be assessed yearly by the justices of the peace or the town-magistrates, at every general Sessions first to be holden after Easter.  The same authorities were to settle all disputes between masters and apprentices, and protect the latter.  The 1st Jac. I. c. 6 expressly extends this power of the justices and town-magistrates to fix wages, to the wages of all labourers and workmen whatever.</P><P>It is evident that, as long as the regulations of the Statute of Apprentices were maintained, the position of the workmen was <EPB/><PB N="clxviii"/>secure.  The long term of service assured them the regularity of employment, which they desired above everything.  The magistrates were, according to the intention of the Act, to assess the wages so as to "yield unto the hired person, both in the time of scarcity and in the time of plenty, a convenient proportion of wages;" and the hours of work were not excessive, especially as the manner of carrying on industry was not then so exhaustive as it is now-a-days.  Besides, the restrictions as to apprentices prevented a too great competition from lowering the skilled workmen to the level of common labourers.  But as Adam Smith<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS482"><HI1 REND="i">Wealth of Nations</HI1>, Bk. I. ch. x. Part ii.</NOTE1> tells us, the operation of this statute was limited by interpretation to cities, towns-corporate, and market-towns, and to those trades only which were established in England before the 5th Eliz.</P><P>In order to prove my assertion, that the Trade-Unions originated with the non-observance of these regulations, I will now successively consider, first, some of the trades subject to the 5th Eliz. c. 4; then, some of those which were incorporated by charter; and lastly, some which were free from any restrictions, whether by charter or Acts of Parliament.</P><P>The woollen manufactures were the old staple trade of England. I have already spoken in Part IV. of the great importance of the Craft-Gilds of the Woollen-weavers; and we have seen how the great number of workmen employed in this trade led them to combine whenever there was a temporary want of sufficient organization.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS483">See pp. cxliii, cxliv, above.</NOTE1>  Later on, the trade came under the 5th Eliz. c. 4, and was regulated besides by the 5th and 6th Edw. VI. c. 22 as to the use of machinery, and by the above<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS484">See p. clxiii.</NOTE1> cited 2nd and 3rd Philip and Mary, c. 11, as to the number of looms which one weaver might have.</P><P>According to a report of a Committee of the House of Commons in 1757, the assessment of wages by the justices seems to have fallen into disuse in this trade already before 1720.  In that year the justices fixed a rate of wages; but it was not carried out into practice.  This want of fixed wages evidently led to oppressions of the workmen by the masters, and induced the men to combine.  Accordingly, in 1725 the 12th Geo. I. c. 34 prohibited the combinations of workmen employed in the woollen manufactures; and an Act of the following year ordered the justices once more to fix the rate of wages in this trade.  In accordance with this Act, the workmen petitioned the justices in 1756 to fix such rates of wages.  But as the masters made a counter-petition, the justices refused to act.  The immediate consequence, according to the evidence of a master, was, that <EPB/><PB N="clxix"/>the Weavers revolted, hindered the journeymen who went on working, and drove them from their looms.  This master estimates the losses which arose to the country from these riots, at from £15,000 to £20,000.  This strike induced the master manufacturers to agree with the workmen, and peace was at once re-established.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS485"><HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxvii. pp. 730-733.</NOTE1>  In the same year the justices were ordered again, by the 29th Geo. II. c. 33, to settle the rates of labour yearly in the woollen manufactures.</P><P>But these were mere transitory skirmishes, called forth by individual attempts of the masters to abolish the existing order of things.  As, however, this order was still maintained by the legislature, these attempts did not at that time lead to the formation of lasting Trade-Societies.  This did not come about till the transition of the woollen manufactures from the domestic to the factory system, and till the attempt of the master manufacturers to get the 5th Eliz. c. 4 repealed.  A Parliamentary Report<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS486"><HI1 REND="i">Report and Minutes of Evidence on the State of the Woollen Manufacture of England</HI1>, July 4th, 1806.  Every single statement made in the following account in the text can be proved from this report, which I recommend every reader interested in the subject to peruse, as it is one of the most interesting reports I know of.</NOTE1> exists which gives almost a photograph of the state of the woollen manufactures at the time of these changes.  As it is of importance for the understanding of the origin of Trade-Unions in all trades to have a clear idea of this transition, I will give a detailed account of these changes in the woollen manufactures, and will then deal less fully with the other trades.</P><P>The woollen manufactures were carried on in the last century by small masters in their own homes.  They dwelt in villages and scattered houses, and often cultivated besides a little land, from three to twelve or fifteen acres.  Often too they had a horse to carry their cloth to market, or, in later times, to the public mill.  The number of such small masters in the environs of Leeds was estimated in 1806 as 3500.</P><P>Every master had served a seven years' apprenticeship.  Though the 5th Eliz. c. 4 was not known, either to masters or men, its regulations were maintained, because they corresponded to custom. Thus even in 1806 there were in Harmley, a clothworkers' village of from 4000 to 5000 inhabitants, ninety-seven apprentices bound for seven years, and only four bound for a shorter period.</P><P>Each master employed on the average ten journeymen and apprentices.  As a rule there was one apprentice to two or three <EPB/><PB N="clxx"/>journeymen.  Besides, the master was regularly assisted by his wife and children.  Children working with their fathers did not need to be bound by indenture.  As a rule, all these persons worked in the master's house, where the wool was worked through all the various stages, till it became undressed cloth, and, if necessary, was dyed.  Sometimes also the journeymen did the work in their own houses, and were assisted in it by their wives.</P><P>The master himself taught the apprentice his trade.  If the latter had the prospect of ever becoming a master himself, he was also taught how to buy raw materials.  In this case the master received a premium on taking the apprentice.  After the seven years' apprenticeship the apprentice could settle at once as a master; but as a rule he worked first for one or two years as a journeyman.  The fact that a young man of good repute could always get credit for as much wool as would enable him to settle as a small master, is especially urged in recommendation of this system.  The great stability and regularity of employment appears, however, as its chief advantage.  Slackness of trade did not at once stop work in the workshops.  The master went on working, although he could not find an immediate sale for his products, and took his wares to the market.  The fact is, that he seldom worked to order.  Sale in the cloth-halls was the rule. If, then, a sudden stagnation occurred in the foreign market, or a large firm became bankrupt, the losses distributed themselves over a larger surface.  They fell on the whole body of manufacturers; and though each individual small master suffered by it, there were but few, if any, whom it ruined.  In such extreme cases the small masters also often took work from other small masters, to maintain their families.</P><P>Like the trade of the masters, the employment of the journeymen was exceedingly regular.  As a rule, journeymen were hired for a year, and had board and washing at their masters'.  They received besides, annual wages of from £8 to £10.  There were journeymen who had continually for twenty years and more worked with the same masters.  If trade became slack, or there was a stop in the sale, journeymen were not suddenly discharged in masses.  Such discharges scarcely ever happened; as a rule, the masters let the men work on in the hope of better times. They considered it a duty to keep, in time of distress, the workmen to whose exertions in good times they owed their wealth. If a master was in want of work for his journeyman, he used to see about for a job for him at another master's; if one could not be got, he was kept on by his old master.  "The men and masters," says a master, "were in general so joined together in sentiment, and, if I may be permitted to use the term, love to each other, that <EPB/><PB N="clxxi"/>they did not wish to be separated if they could help it."  If, on the other hand, a master ever had more orders than he could satisfy, he asked another master to lend him a journeyman.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS487">See the <HI1 REND="i">Report</HI1> above referred to, p. 8.  See, for the passage cited in the text, p. 43.  As the statements in the text might be thought by some exaggerated, I will quote some questions and answers from the <HI1 REND="i">Report</HI1>.  "During the time you were employed by a domestic manufacturer, had you regular work constantly?" "Yes, I had; I never had reason to complain."  "Were you constantly employed without reference to masters, or were you sometimes employed and sometimes discharged?" —"I never was discharged; I have been with masters where they were short, and they used to see about for a job for me, and if one could not be got, I was continued."  "If the domestic master was short he wished you to pick up another job, if you could get it; if not, he would continue to give you employment?" —"Yes." (p. 117.)  "As to the habit of clothiers keeping the persons they employed, you have stated that to be your habit?"—"Yes."  "Would it have been possible for you, without evident disadvantage to yourself, to have kept on persons, paying them wages, without deriving any benefit from their work?"—"We consider it as a duty, and there is that good understanding between the employers and the employed, that we should think it a very irksome task to turn off a workman whom we consider as a good and an honest workman."  (p. 131.) And again on p. 40:  "I scarcely ever knew a man discharged from his master because his master could not give him employment."</NOTE1></P><P>The centres of this organization of trade were the cloth-halls, to which the masters brought their products to market.  In Leeds there were two halls, one for white cloth and one for coloured.  Similar halls were at Bradford, Halifax, and Huddersfield. There the cloth was examined and measured by the authorities.  The two chief cloth-halls at Leeds were under the direction of a certain number of Trustees, who were elected for three years by all the clothworkers of the manufacturing villages, as the most trustworthy and most intelligent of their body. They watched over the general trade interests, and especially the observance of all rules and bye-laws which were framed from time to time for the government of the halls.  No clothworker was allowed to bring his wares for sale in these halls, unless he had served a seven years' apprenticeship.</P><P>The introduction of machinery brought a change into this state of things.  Mills were now erected on rivers and streams, to make use of the fall of the water.  Various processes, which had before been chiefly performed by hand under the masters' own roof, were now executed in public mills by machinery.  In the neighbourhood of every manufacturing village were several such mills to be found.  The manufacturer brought his wares to them with little trouble and loss of time, and fetched them back after they had gone through the necessary process.  The cost was but small, so that he was enabled to get by these mills the advantage of very expensive machines.  Sometimes too the master himself performed the work by machinery in the mill, in order that it might be well done.</P><EPB/><PB N="clxxii"/><P>In this domestic system of industry the work was chiefly performed by persons who were its proprietors.  It was not so in the system of the "rich master clothiers" which arose in the West of England.  They bought the foreign wool directly from the importer, and the native in the fleece, or from the woolstapler. They then gave it to workmen to work up, partly in their own houses, partly in the masters'.  For every single process through which the wool had to go until its completion, the masters gave the ware to another class of workers, none of whom went out of his own line.  By this the workers obtained great skill in the performance of their operations.  As in this system, so also in the system of the master manufacturers which came into existence with the origin of machinery, the workers were not the owners of the work they worked on.  The merchants, for the most part possessors of large capitals, now became manufacturers themselves, and erected mills.  In one or several buildings they kept more or less operatives working-up by machinery, under the employers' or their overseers' superintendence, the materials belonging to them.</P><P>These changes in the manner of carrying on industry led to others in the position of the journeymen.  The first change was, that the apprentices were often no longer bound by indenture, though they mostly still served their seven years without it. In the mills, however, it also soon became usual to employ workers who had served no apprenticeship, besides great numbers of women and children; the latter at an earlier age than would have been possible without machinery, and according to the 5th Eliz. c. 4. Their labour was of course much cheaper than that of skilled workmen.  The number of employers who had served no apprenticeship increased more and more.  Whereas formerly the cloth of no master who had not served a seven years' apprenticeship was admitted to the cloth-halls, the trustees framed in 1796 a new regulation, according to which those manufacturers also were to be admitted who had carried on the trade of a clothworker for only five years.  Soon after, all persons were admitted to the cloth-halls without any qualification.</P><P>It seems that at the beginning neither masters nor journeymen resisted at once the violation of the old customs and laws.  But the employment of great numbers of children, apprentices, and journeymen who had served no apprenticeship, soon took the bread out of the mouths of the Weavers, and this led in 1796 to the formation of a Trade-Society, the so-called <HI1 REND="i">Institution</HI1>, among the Clothworkers at Halifax, to prevent people from carrying on the trade in violation of custom and law.  They did not know that, according to the 5th Eliz. c. 4, they might produce in court <EPB/><PB N="clxxiii"/>against the transgressors of this law, for they were entirely ignorant that this statute existed at all; they only knew the old restrictions as the customary order.  Another object of the Institution was the assistance of sick members.  When, by the 39th Geo. III. c. 81, in 1799, all such associations were suppressed, and the accumulation of funds by them especially prohibited, the Institution was nevertheless carried on.  The only change was, that instead of keeping accumulated funds, the necessary money was levied by subscriptions in each case of want. The Institution included the workmen of several places.</P><P>As the new system spread, the greater irregularity of employment was felt more and more by the workmen.  Every small fluctuation of trade affected the capital of a single large manufacturer much more than it had formerly affected a multitude of small ones, who had often even not noticed it.  Every stop in the sale led at once to a discharge of workmen.  Whereas formerly in bad times the small masters had worked on stock, the master-manufacturers avoided the accumulation of stock, and worked only to order.  Whilst formerly wages had been settled for the year, now every fluctuation led to reductions of wages.  Besides, "the opulent clothiers made it a rule to have one-third more men than they could employ, and then these had to stand still part of their time."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS488"><HI1 REND="i">Report</HI1>, p. 111.</NOTE1>  At the beginning, on the erection of a mill, the master-manufacturers enticed the workmen by high wages from the service of the domestic clothiers; but then every fluctuation brought reductions of wages and discharges.  Whenever such discharged workmen found work again even for less wages at a domestic clothier's, on account of the greater regularity of employment they never wished afterwards to change their place, even for higher wages at the factories.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS489">A journeyman who had formerly worked in a factory, being asked why he works for a small master though at less wages, says:  "My reason is, when I have been out of employ, I have gone from house to house to work; and it seldom happens that the smaller clothiers change their men, except in the case of death and sickness.  I never could lay hold of such an opportunity before."—<HI1 REND="i">Report</HI1>, p. 115.</NOTE1></P><P>The position of the domestic master-clothiers was also greatly deteriorated by the spread of the factories.  With the growth of these, home-work decreased.  Many who had been masters sank to be workmen.  Many who would formerly have become masters, now remained workmen for ever.  They began to fear that the factory system would entirely supplant the domestic, and they therefore supported the workmen in their resistance.</P><P>As, in consequence of the 39th and 40th Geo. III. c. 106 (1800), all combinations were severely prohibited, the workmen <EPB/><PB N="clxxiv"/>combined under the cloak of Friendly-Societies.  The Report from the Committee on Woollen-Clothiers' Petitions of March 14th, 1803, contains the rules of a Trade-Society which had been begun as a Friendly-Society on Sept. 24th, 1802, and also an advertisement from a newspaper, "calling a meeting of one weaver out of the parish he represents, in order to determine on prosecuting those who unlawfully exercise or follow the trade of a weaver."  At the same time we see the Trade-Society already anxious for the morals of the workmen—as before, the old Gilds —for they offer a reward to him who would detect any workman embezzling materials.  The chief object of this and similar Trade-Societies was the legal prosecution of transgressors of the 5th Eliz. c. 4, of the 5th and 6th Edw. VI. c. 22, and the 2nd and 3rd Philip and Mary, c. 11.</P><P>After several employers had been condemned, first the master-manufacturers of Somersetshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS490"><HI1 REND="i">Report from the Committee on Woollen-Clothiers' Petition</HI1>, March 14th, 1803.</NOTE1>and afterwards those of Yorkshire,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS491"><HI1 REND="i">Report on Yorkshire Woollen Petitions</HI1>, May 9th, 1803.</NOTE1> petitioned Parliament for the repeal of the last-named statutes.  They especially urged the fact, that there were no master-manufacturers, and very few journeymen, who had served a seven years' apprenticeship, and that masses of workmen would become breadless if the 5th Eliz. c. 4 was carried out.  Others<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS492"><HI1 REND="i">Report on Woollen-Manufacturers' Petition</HI1>, April 24th, 1804.</NOTE1> desired the repeal of the 5th and 6th Edw. VI. c. 22 only, but wished the maintenance of the two other statutes for the protection of the domestic trade, the 27th, 28th, and 32nd sections of the Statute of Apprentices excepted. On these petitions the said laws were in 1803 (43rd Geo. III. c. 136) suspended for one year for the woollen manufactures, and all prosecutions for violating them were stopped.  This suspension was renewed in 1804, 1805, 1806, and so forth, until the final repeal of the laws (49th Geo. III. c. 109) in 1809.</P><P>After these petitions had been presented to Parliament, the trustees of the cloth-halls at Leeds assembled the clothworkers of the villages which they represented, to agree on counter measures.  They signed counter petitions, and appointed agents to support them before Parliament.  The necessary moneys were raised by subscriptions.  Besides, the trustees prosecuted employers who violated the laws in question.  They acted for both masters and men.</P><P>But it soon appeared to their constituents, that the trustees did not proceed with sufficient zeal.  "When we saw," says a journeyman, "that they did not advance, and as we knew the evils arising therefrom, and that we thereby should become <EPB/><PB N="clxxv"/>breadless," the workmen took the affair into their own hands, petitioned Parliament by themselves, and appointed their own agents.  They again formed an Institution, about the year 1803. All journeymen belonged to it, and all working in any workshop contributed together to its funds.  Even so early as this, contributions are to be found from members of other trades, as from Bricklayers, Carpenters, &amp;c.  Many home-working master Clothiers also, and very wealthy ones among them, joined the Institution to push forward affairs before Parliament, as the trustees seemed to give up the concern.  It appears from evidence before the Committee, that the Institution spent from £10,000 to £12,000 on petitions to Parliament.</P><P>According to the "Rules and Orders of the Clothiers' Community, 1803," the chief object of the Institution was to carry out the legal regulations as to apprentices, in their original purity.  But it is declared at the same time that those who till now had carried on the trade contrary to these regulations should continue without molestation.  The activity of the society was only to extend to the future.  The Rules complain besides, that the abuses which had arisen, especially the large number of hands who had been driven into the trade, had destroyed the mutual dependence between masters and men, and had produced pride and overbearing on the part of the former.  Henceforth all apprentices were to be considered unlawful who had not been bound by indenture for seven years.  They were to be bound, moreover, at so early an age, that their term would have expired before their majority, as no indenture was binding after their twenty-first year.  The only exception was made in the case of a son of a lawful workman who served his father seven years. I must here mention, that with the factory system a new kind of apprentices sprung up, namely, apprentices bound to journeymen; hitherto all had been bound to the master.  Nobody, as the Rules further ordain, was to learn two trades at once.  In other Rules, workmen of other trades also stated that this regulation of the 37th Edw. III. c. 5<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS493">See pp. cxxiii, cxxiv, above.</NOTE1> was to be maintained.</P><P>To the prosecution of this chief object, the Institution added the assistance of the sick, and of the widows of deceased members, under entirely similar conditions as are still now usual in Trade-Unions. The necessary moneys were collected, in every single case, in the name of the sick, or of the widow of the deceased. In Leeds, the contribution of each member was 1d. a week, and at Halifax 3d.  Twice a year a committee of thirteen was elected by the members at a general meeting, to manage the affairs of <EPB/><PB N="clxxvi"/>the Institution.  Seven were to form a quorum.  Fines were imposed for not accepting office when chosen.  On resigning, the committee had to render account of their doings.  There were also stewards, who had to provide for the collection of contributions, and the assistance of the sick.  Besides, we find here also what we found in the Statutes of all Gilds, from the Gilds of Abbotsbury, Exeter, and Cambridge, namely, that all offences at meetings, by using bad language, ill-behaviour, and the like, should be punished.  The committee had the right to alter the rules according to need.  If any cause of complaint arose, either as to apprentices or as to some other rule, the men of the workshop were first to inquire into the case, to try and arrange the difficulty.  But wherever they did not succeed, the difference was to be brought before the committee, whose decision was to be final.</P><P>The masters, however, did not continue long in the Institution. The fact was, that it also assisted men on strike.  At one place the workmen of a master-manufacturer quarrelled with him and struck work.  The members of the Institution wished to assist them; upon this the masters left the society.</P><P>When the master-manufacturers heard that the object of the Institution was to petition Parliament for the maintenance of the 5th Eliz. c. 4, they required their workmen to leave it.  On refusing this they were all discharged.  The master-manufacturers even entered into combinations for suppressing the Institution, which, strange to say, notwithstanding the 39th and 40th Geo. III. c. 106, was considered allowable by the Parliamentary Committee, though it was hostile to the Institution.  On the other hand, the workmen at some places forced the owners of mills who worked for others on hire, to enter their society, as otherwise they declared they would not work for them.  They also hindered them from working for such masters as were hostile to the Institution.  Once, when a master-manufacturer employed unlawful workers, his journeymen struck work.  The rest of the master-manufacturers then promised their colleague assistance, and offered to do his work for him in the meantime.  But when they attempted to do this, all their journeymen threatened to leave their factories at once.  Finally, the masters signed a contract, according to which they obliged themselves to engage no more workmen for the future, contrary to the 5th Eliz. c. 4.</P><P>When, year after year, notwithstanding all petitions of the workmen, the Acts regulating the woollen manufacture were suspended, a factory was burnt down; and in September, 1805, the London Fire Insurance Companies received letters of caution <EPB/><PB N="clxxvii"/>from workmen, wherein they declared that, as Parliament refused to protect their right, they would do it themselves. Though the Report of the Committee expressly states, that not the Institution, but individuals, must be charged with these nefarious deeds, yet they prove the exasperation prevailing among the workmen.  But notwithstanding this exasperation, and the attachment of the journeymen to their Trade-Society, which even then was so great, that as a master said in evidence, if it were prohibited they would rather follow it than the laws of the land, yet this Trade-Society ceased at once, when in Christmas, 1805, the trustees of the cloth-halls again took up the petitions.  The workmen at once delivered them all their funds.  It is evident from this, that the object of the Institution was nothing but the maintenance of the existing legal and customary regulations of trade.  As soon as the State ceased to maintain order, it stepped into its place; and as soon as there was a prospect of a more legitimate authority putting the law into practice, the Institution ceased at once.</P><P>The Committee of the House of Commons before which this evidence was taken was, however, not favourable to the cause of the workmen.  As ever on such occasions, the followers of the movement were spoken of as "poor deluded wretches," and it was made an especial fault of the Institution, that "its inevitable though gradual result must be the progressive rise of wages among all classes of workmen."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS494"><HI1 REND="i">Report of</HI1> 1806, p. 17.</NOTE1>  The Committee met the petitions for the maintenance of the existing laws with the very naïve consolation, that the advantages of the domestic system were so great, that it could never be supplanted by the factory system; and by referring to the "true principles of commerce which were now so generally understood and acknowledged." But as the Committee recommended in the same breath the maintenance of the laws prohibiting the export of raw materials and machinery, the emigration of skilled workmen to foreign countries, and combinations of journeymen, it seems that they accepted Adam Smith's principles with conditions only.  Their reason for advising the repeal of the 5th Eliz. c. 4 appears rather to have been the one uttered by one of the members of the Committee, namely, that its "maintenance would put the determination of the price of labour in the power of those who had the means of working."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS495"><HI1 REND="i">Minutes of</HI1> 1806, p. 178.</NOTE1>  Indeed, Adam Smith was right in saying, "Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and workmen, its counsellors are always the masters!"</P><EPB/><PB N="clxxviii"/><P>After the repeal of the said statutes (p. clxviii) the combinations among the workmen in the woollen manufactures became chronic.</P><P>Earlier than the Trade-Society which the Clothworkers began in 1802 under the cover of a Friendly-Society, the Shipwrights of Liverpool had formed themselves in the last century into a Trade-Society, which was nominally a mere benefit-club.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS496"><HI1 REND="i">Social Science Association's Report on Trade Societies</HI1>, p. 480.</NOTE1>  Here too the abuse of employing chiefly apprentices caused the origin of this union.  But much earlier than the Trade-Societies in both these trades were those of the Hatters.  Besides being under the 5th Eliz. c. 4, the hat-trade was under two Acts of the 8th Eliz. and the 1st Jac. I., which only confirmed the regulations of the Statute of Apprentices expressly for that trade. In this trade prevailed, early in the eighteenth century, the system of carrying on industry by means of sub-contractors (<HI1 REND="i">alias</HI1> sweaters), who were called Little Masters.  They received the materials from the master-manufacturers, and got them worked up by apprentices only.  This led to combinations of the journeymen.  From 1772 an extremely vigorous Trade-Society existed among them for maintaining the existing order and providing for the interests of the operatives.  As soon as the employers attempted to give work to sub-contractors, they forced them by strikes to take it back.  The society was called the <HI1 REND="i">Congress</HI1>, was regulated by statutes, and framed bye-laws. All workmen of the trade belonged to it.  Every one had to pay a weekly contribution of 2d.  As the workmen thus prevented the masters from employing an excessive number of apprentices, the masters petitioned Parliament in 1777 for the repeal of the legal restrictions as to apprentices, and for prohibitions of combinations of journeymen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS497"><HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxvii. pp. 730-733.</NOTE1>  Both were granted by the 17th Geo. III. c. 55, which did not however repeal all restrictions, for every master-hatter was to employ one journeyman for every apprentice he might take.</P><P>In the Tailors' trade also combinations must have existed early in the eighteenth century, as the 7th Geo. I. c. 13 forbade them. I could, however, find nothing as to the cause of these combinations in the Journals of the House of Commons.  But it is probable that here also, as in other trades, as for instance in the woollen manufactures just mentioned, the discontinuance of the legal regulation of wages by the justices of the peace occasioned these combinations. This seems the more probable, as the preamble of the 8th Geo. III. c. 17 speaks of those who by "many subtle devices" tried to evade the regulations of wages by the justices <EPB/><PB N="clxxix"/>according to the 7th Geo. I. c. 13.  By these words masters are evidently meant, as the devices of the workmen would have simply been strikes.  In any case, however, the combinations of the Tailors seem to have been but transitory, and not to have led to the formation of lasting Trade-Unions.  At least, during the entire eighteenth century we hear no more of combinations of journeymen, and not even the 8th Geo. III. c. 17 makes mention of them.</P><P>I now turn to the consideration of some trades incorporated by charter.</P><P>The trade of Framework-knitting was not yet established in the 5th Eliz.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS498">Felkin's <HI1 REND="i">History of the Machine wrought Ho<SUPPLIED RESP="gw">s</SUPPLIED>iery and Lace Manufactures</HI1>, London, 1867, pp. 71, 75.</NOTE1>  But in the year 1663 Charles II. incorporated "several persons, by the name of Master, Warden, Assistants, and Society, of the Art and Mystery of Framework-knitters, of the Cities of London and Westminster, the Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales, for ever, with power to exercise their jurisdiction throughout England and Wales; and from time to time to make Bye-laws for the regulation of the said business of Framework-knitting, and to punish persons who should offend against such Bye-laws."  By ò 33 of the Charter<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS499">See the Charter in the <HI1 REND="i">Report from the Committee on Framework-knitters' Petitions</HI1>, 1812, p. 49.</NOTE1> the Master was directed to "enforce the statute of the 5th Eliz. c. 4, or any other statute as respects apprentices and the occupations of the trade."</P><P>By this ordinance of the Charter, therefore, the 5th Eliz. c. 4 had authority also over this trade.  But evidently the Charter was not of the same effect as the Statute of Apprentices would have been, if it had had direct authority over the trade.  The execution of the ordinances of the Charter depended on the Master and Wardens of the Company, that is, on the good-will of employers.  As early as the beginning of the eighteenth century the masters employed apprentices in unlimited numbers, often in the proportion of ten and more apprentices to one journeyman; and there is even a man mentioned who had for thirty years employed constantly twenty-five apprentices to one journeyman. Indeed, this abuse of the want of fixed legal restrictions cannot surprise us, for besides the less wages to be paid to an apprentice, the parishes often paid bounties to the amount of £5 for every boy taken from the workhouse.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS500">Felkin, p. 75.</NOTE1></P><P>By this system the adult workers immediately after the expiration of their apprenticeship fell into deep misery.  They <EPB/><PB N="clxxx"/>therefore, in 1710, petitioned the Company to carry out the regulations of the Charter with regard to apprentices.  But the Company refused.  This was followed by a riot of the workmen; they destroyed about 100 frames, threw them out of the windows, and thrashed the opposing masters and their apprentices.  The frightened masters gave in, and promised to observe for the future the ordinances of the Charter with regard to apprentices. But as the system of parish apprentices was continued, the trade, notwithstanding this promise, was so overstocked with lawful journeymen without employment, that the most serious seditions ensued.  The extent to which they went may be seen from the fact that in 1727 an Act was passed, prohibiting under penalty of death the breaking of frames, which was the men's chief way of revenging themselves on their masters.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS501">Felkin, pp. 73, 227-229.</NOTE1>  The overstocking of the trade with breadless parish apprentices who had served their term, brought them, in the years 1740 to 1750, near to starvation, according to Mr. Felkin's<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS502">Ibid. p. 82</NOTE1> account.  "There was often only one coat in a shop, which was worn by each in turn,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS503">Among the London tailors such a coat is called a "reliever."</NOTE1> as he went out from its precincts; so that one Moss, a Northamptonshire master, refused to employ a man possessed of a good coat, declaring the best workmen were only to be found in ragged ones."</P><P>On May 22, 1745, the Company ordained new bye-laws,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS504"><HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxvi. pp. 790-794.</NOTE1> which were confirmed by the Lord Chancellor in accordance with the 19th Henry VII. c. 7.  They enacted once more the old restrictions as to apprentices.  Besides, these bye-laws contain the first direct news of the practice which was to bring such infinite misery on the workmen, namely, of owners of frames who, though they did not themselves exercise the trade, let frames out on hire.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS505">See Felkin, p. 79.</NOTE1>  This is the first intimation of mere capitalist-employers. But when the Company did nothing further but attempt to enforce its authority in favour of the London employers throughout the whole country, this led to the entire loss of its influence.</P><P>When, at the beginning and in the middle of the eighteenth century, the trade retired more and more from London to Nottingham, the Company sent its deputies there to maintain its privileges.  But the Nottingham manufacturers did not acknowledge them.  They were already employers of the modern style; they had (for the most part) not served a seven years' apprenticeship themselves, and employed unlawful workers, such <EPB/><PB N="clxxxi"/>as journeymen who had not served their legal term or did not belong to the Company, as well as women and children; of two employers, we are even told that the one worked with twenty-three, the other with forty-nine, apprentices, without employing any journeymen.  The Company relying on its Ordinances confirmed by the Lord Chancellor, threatened to enforce these masters' submission at law.  But then its former conduct towards the petitions of the journeymen in 1710, and its own degeneration, were revenged upon itself.  The retort on it was that its members did not themselves maintain the seven years' apprenticeship as a qualification of trade,—that they had themselves given up the requisite of a masterpiece,—and that instead of preventing frauds they rather committed them themselves.  The fact is, that the London manufacturers were quite as much modern employers as those of Nottingham, and their whole proceeding appears nothing but a trick arising from envy.  The workmen, however, hailed with joy the proceedings of the Company.  The Company also addressed the men especially, asked them to join them, made easier for them the conditions of entrance, promised the re-establishment of the old order, and designated themselves as the true friends of the workmen, whilst they called their other employers their enemies.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS506"><HI1 REND="i">Journals, &amp;c.</HI1>, vol. xxvi. p. 794.</NOTE1>  The master-manufacturers, threatened with lawsuits by the Company, petitioned Parliament and accused the Company of ruining the trade by monopolies.  As Parliament was of the same opinion, the Company became unable to enforce its bye-laws legally, and therefore ceased henceforth to exercise a real influence over the trade.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS507">Felkin, pp. 79, 80.</NOTE1></P><P>Notwithstanding the enormous rise of framework-knitting in the period from 1750 to 1780, the workmen—as Mr. Felkin says—but slowly, partially, and indirectly profited by it.  The trade suffered under the constant influx of boys, girls, and nonfreed workmen.  Whilst these abuses had hitherto produced only violent transitory revolts, they then—when all hope in the efficiency of the Company had been finally destroyed—led to the formation of a Trade-Union of the workmen.  Thus arose the Stocking-makers' Association for Mutual Protection in the Midland Counties of England, for the purpose of making regulations as to apprentices, inasmuch as a legal order was wanting.  This body soon became so powerful in Nottingham that it influenced the elections for Parliament, and even made them.  Mr. Abel Smith was thus returned without opposition in 1778, when the members of this Association marched in procession before his chair, accompanied by two assistants, the clerk, and other <EPB/><PB N="clxxxii"/>deputies of the London Framework-knitters Company.  "This formerly authoritative body had," as Mr. Felkin says, "another opportunity thus given them, by wise and timely measures, to have rendered themselves useful between the master-hosiers and their discontented workmen.  The novelty of high rents exacted for frames, with other charges, had not yet settled into a legalized custom; the best of the journeymen and wisest of the masters might have been conciliated, and the Charter revived; but the time was wasted in squabbles about fees, and the Company lost almost its last hold on the trade."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS508">See for these statements Felkin, pp. 115-117.</NOTE1></P><P>As the complete abandonment of the workmen to the discretion of the employers plunged them, notwithstanding the flourishing state of the trade, into the greatest misery, they petitioned the House of Commons in 1778 for a legal regulation of the rate of wages.  In consequence of low wages, the payment of frame-rents, and other charges of the employers, they were, according to their statement, unable to maintain themselves and their families.  As the master-hosiers made a counter-petition, a Committee was appointed to inquire into the complaints of the workmen.  The witnesses examined confirmed the justice of the journeymen's statements in an alarming manner.  The earnings of a workman were affirmed to be about 6<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> a week.  Besides, there were the most infamous exactions on the part of the employers.  According to the evidence of an examined master, many of them hired workmen without giving them sufficient employment, for the mere purpose of obtaining frame-rents.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS509"><HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxxvi. pp. 635, 728, 740-742.</NOTE1>But notwithstanding the Report of the Committee, the influence of the masters prevailed, and the motion for enacting a law according to the petition remained in the minority.  On this the employers in the silk branch of the trade attempted at once to reduce the prices paid for the work 25 per cent., and a strike was the immediate result.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS510">Felkin, pp. 115-117.</NOTE1></P><P>On the 2nd of February, 1779, the Framework-knitters of Nottingham and the environs again petitioned the House for the regulation of the trade of framework-knitting.  This petition was followed by similar ones from Tewkesbury, Godalming, Derby, London, Westminster, and Northampton.  Witnesses from all these places were examined by a Committee.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS511"><HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxxvii. pp. 117. 295. 301, 370-372.</NOTE1>  The shameless exactions on the workmen by their masters unveiled by this Committee find their equal only in the articles of the <EPB/><PB N="clxxxiii"/><HI1 REND="i">Morning Chronicle</HI1><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS512">The numbers of December 14th and 18th.  See also <HI1 REND="i">Cheap Clothes and Nasty</HI1>by Parson Lot, 1850.</NOTE1> in 1849, on the position of the London Tailors, and their oppressions by Sweaters.  According to the evidence of all witnesses examined, wages had constantly fallen during the then last twenty years, whilst the prices of food had risen.  The employers had always endeavoured to reduce wages. After various deductions—which the workmen had to submit to—for frame-rent, winding, seaming, needles, candles, &amp;c., their wages are stated as 6<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> or 8<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> weekly.  Numbers of workmen could not even earn as much.  The most disgraceful abuse was carried on as to frame-rents.  The value of a frame is stated as £6 or £8.  But for its use the workmen had to pay rents from 1s. 3d. to 2s. a week, that is, up to 86 per cent.  The workmen were obliged to hire these frames, if they wished to get work; if a workman had himself a frame, he was refused work.  This rent the workmen had to pay whether they worked or not, even during their sickness, for Sundays and holidays, or when they had no materials, which the employers had to furnish.  Many employers in Nottingham stinted their workmen from making more than a certain number of stockings a week, though they could have made more,—evidently that they might thus be able to deduct the more frame-rent from a certain sum of wages. The workmen had to buy from the employers the materials for making the stockings.  The latter then rebought the stockings from the workmen.  But they also often left them on the workmen's hands.  The workmen, says the Report, were in a state of starvation.  They had to submit to any conditions of their employers.  A number of workmen who had signed the last year's petition to Parliament had had to leave off work.—The witnesses brought forward the fact that the masters and men at Dublin had agreed on a price list, and that the Lord Mayor had confirmed it; that both parties were there now content, and that the workmen had bettered themselves in consequence of the list, and earned more wages.  They desired a Bill fixing prices, which would, as they thought, produce a very wholesome effect.</P><P>On this Report the House resolved that a Bill should be introduced for regulating the trade of framework-knitting, and for preventing the frauds and abuses therein.  Mr. Meadows, one of the members for Nottinghamshire, brought in the Bill on May the 10th, 1779.  It was strenuously supported by Mr. Robert Smith (afterwards Lord Carrington), who said "the measure was moistened and saturated by the tears of the poor distressed families of framework-knitters."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS513">Felkin. pp. 115-117.</NOTE1>  Leave was given to bring in <EPB/><PB N="clxxxiv"/>the Bill, with only one dissentient voice.  Upon this the employers counter-petitioned.  They said that if the Bill should become law, this, "from various reasons" (<HI1 REND="i">sic!</HI1>), would be most injurious to the petitioners, and to the wholesale merchants in the trade of framework-knitting.  A Committee was appointed, which was once more to inquire into the state of the workmen. On the 9th of June they reported that the former statements of the workmen were <HI1 REND="i">true</HI1>, and proposed only a few amendments in the Bill.  The second reading was carried by twenty-four against twenty-three.  But it was thrown out upon the third reading by a majority of fifty-two to eighteen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS514"><HI1 REND="i">Journals of the House of Commons</HI1>, vol. xxxvii. pp. 386, 396, 421, 441.</NOTE1>  Indeed, I was wrong in approving above of the saying of Adam Smith, that whenever the Legislature has attempted to regulate the differences between masters and workmen, its counsellors have always been the masters. This statement contains but half the truth.  It has also always been the same whenever the Legislature refused such regulation.</P><P>Upon the rejection of the Bill, great excitement of the workmen ensued.  They crowded to Nottingham, broke the frames of those manufacturers by whose special influence the Bill had been lost—as well as of other employers—threw them out of the windows, burned a house down, and destroyed much property belonging to the employers.  More than 300 frames were broken on this occasion.  The whole of the employers then promised, if the riots would at once cease, to remove all grievances.  On this, peace ensued.  Public opinion seems to have been on the side of the journeymen, for the workman accused of having set fire to the house was acquitted.  But the employers kept their word badly.  They had formed a union of their own.  After the ferment had subsided, they issued an address, stating that they would oppose all regulations, whether by charter or Acts of Parliament, as tending to drive the manufacture to France, where workmen were contented with low wages.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS515">Felkin, pp. 117, 227-229.</NOTE1></P><P>The grievances of the workmen in the trade increased more and more.  From 1780, in consequence of the system of rent-charge for the use of stocking frames having become fully established, the construction of machinery proceeded very rapidly for the next thirty years.  The cost bore so small a proportion to the rent, as to induce many persons not in the trade to purchase frames.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS516">Ibid. p. 117.</NOTE1>  On this came a vast increase in the number of apprentices.  Mr. Felkin mentions an instance of a father and son in Nottingham having, in 1810, twenty-four apprentices; and two framework-knitters at Hinchley having 100 between them. <EPB/><PB N="clxxxv"/>The whole district was accordingly in a constant state of riot. In their distress the workmen turned their attention once more to the powers entrusted to the chartered London Company, and sought its intervention for their relief.  But it was then too late for its action.  The Company proceeded, indeed, at law against a manufacturer for taking apprentices in violation of the bye-laws of the Company, but the manufacturer was condemned in 1<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> damages only.  As wages became more and more dependent on the discretion of the employers, the workmen again applied in 1812 to Parliament to enforce payment by statement-lists. But though a Bill embodying such clauses passed the Commons, the appeal was unsuccessful in the Lords.  On this the workmen in all the branches of the trade entered into union in 1814.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS517">Felkin, pp. 435-439 and foll.—The London Company existed till 1835.</NOTE1>Since then, until the time of Mr. Mundella, attempts to fix statement-lists of prices have changed with strikes, when these were violated by the masters, and with unsuccessful applications to Parliament for laws regulating the trade.</P><P>To mention another incorporated trade, I take the Cutlers in Sheffield.  Already before 1790 the masters there must have attempted to violate the customary restrictions as to apprentices; and they were probably hindered in this by the journeymen. But far from withdrawing from the corporation, they complained of these restrictions in 1790 to Parliament, and petitioned for alleviations in the bye-laws of the Company.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS518"><HI1 REND="i">Journals</HI1>, vol. xlvi. pp. 11, 12.</NOTE1>  These were granted in an Act of June the 7th, 1791;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS519"><HI1 REND="i">Ibid.</HI1> p. 717.</NOTE1> and forthwith, on the 9th of September of the same year, we find combinations among the Scissor-grinders and other workmen.  On the 3rd of April following the Scissor-smiths' Benefit Society was formed. According to Mr. Hill's account,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS520"><HI1 REND="i">S. S. A. Rep. on Trades' Societies</HI1>, p. 526.</NOTE1> it was a Trade-Society to oppose the actions of the employers, which probably took the shape of a Friendly-Society to evade the 39th and 40th Geo. III. chap. 106.</P><P>The same phenomena which we observed in the trades incorporated by charter, or under the 5th Eliz. chap. 4, recur in those which had been always free from any legal restrictions.  Among these was the trade of the Calico-printers.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS521">See for the following statements, "Minutes of evidence taken before the Committee, to whom the petition of the several journeymen Calico-Printers and others working in that trade, &amp;c., was referred," July 4, 1804; and the Report from the Committee on these minutes, July 17, 1806.</NOTE1>  Nevertheless, though the regulations of the 5th Eliz. chap. 4 had no power over this trade, yet they were observed in it as the order sanctioned by the general <EPB/><PB N="clxxxvi"/>custom of trade before the introduction of machinery.  But simultaneously with the introduction of machinery, about the year 1790, the unlimited employment of apprentices in the place of adult journeymen became general in this trade.  And the disproportion between journeymen and apprentices which, not restricted by even the possibility of a legal prosecution, arose in the counties of Lancaster, Derby, Cheshire, and Stafford in England, and in those of Lanark, Renfrew, Dumbarton, Stirling, and Perth in Scotland, surpassed by far that existing in all other trades.  In Lancashire there were cases of fifty-five apprentices to two journeymen only; and in the county of Dumbarton cases of sixty to two.  These proportions had however been in no way caused by a want of hands from the great rise of the trade after the introduction of machinery.  On the contrary, whilst all apprentices were working full time in the factories, the journeymen sought in vain for work.  And whenever the state of the trade necessitated a discharge of hands, the journeymen were always discharged first, whilst the apprentices remained fully employed.  The reason was rather this, that the masters, by employing apprentices instead of journeymen, saved one-third in wages.  And it was not rare "that apprentices were discharged immediately upon the expiration of their apprenticeship, although the work was unfinished, the masters being unwilling to pay them journeymen's wages, even until such work was finished." Against the evil consequences naturally to be apprehended from the comparative unskilfulness of boys, the masters provided, by making at their discretion an adequate deduction from their wages, whenever work was spoilt by the boys.  The position of the apprentices was just as precarious as the situation of the journeymen was miserable.  The employers declined taking apprentices on indenture, and accepted them only on verbal promises of serving seven years.  To enforce the observation of this agreement, they required from the parents of the boy a bond of £50, and also retained a certain part of their earnings—as a rule £10—until the term of apprenticeship agreed to had elapsed. Besides, the apprentices often had to serve from eight to ten years instead of seven; for when at any time the employer had no work for his apprentice, he forced him to serve more than his term for the time in which he had no work.  The employer, on the other hand, did not take upon himself any legal obligation whatever towards his apprentices.  He could discharge him at will, and very often did so.  These apprentices were partly parish apprentices, partly children of workmen, who were forced by their employers by threats of instant dismissal in case of refusal to apprentice their children.  And whilst the trade "produced <EPB/><PB N="clxxxvii"/>among the generality of workers a great difficulty of breathing, diseases of the lungs, &amp;c.; whilst their sight was apt to fail them at an early age, and the period of old age very soon reached them," and they thus became unfit for any other employment, they were mostly discharged at once after the expiration of their apprenticeship.  There is also evidence as to workers being dismissed immediately on their sight beginning to fail them.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS522">Compare Sheridan's speech on these abuses in <HI1 REND="i">Hansard</HI1>, vol. ix. pp. 534-537.</NOTE1></P><P>This abuse of power on the part of the masters, and their aggressions, especially on the journeymen's customary right of preference to employment, which they had acquired by a regular apprenticeship, led at once, as might be expected, to the formation of Trade-Societies.  All journeymen of the trade belonged to this Calico-printers' Trade-Society, as all Clothworkers did to their Institution.  At first there were no regular obligatory payments, but all contributed voluntarily to a common fund. From this fund the sick members, and those out of work, were assisted.  When such accumulations of funds had been prohibited by the 39th and 40th Geo. III. chap. 106, the Calico-printer Unionists gave each member a ticket.  On presenting this, the bearer—like the wandering journeymen in Germany—received a donation from the workers in every workshop he passed. Originally, everybody was free to give what he pleased; but gradually there arose too great a disproportion, as the zealous often gave 6<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>, whilst the lukewarm gave nothing.  Then the journeymen were bound to fixed contributions, in England to a halfpenny, in Scotland to 1<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> each.  It seems that as the trade developed further, only the more zealous journeymen belonged to the Union, and that thus a closer and more restricted association arose, which no longer comprehended all workers in the trade. Another rule among these workmen which has a certain likeness to those of the German journeymen's fraternities, was, that every apprentice or workman who wished to work in a workshop, had first to apply to the journeymen, before asking the masters for work.  The reason was, that if discontent existed, or there was not plenty of work, the employers might not take advantage of the new offer of labour to discharge their journeymen or reduce wages.  If new apprentices were taken, a strike ensued.  When the journeymen struck work, the apprentices generally went with them, and were assisted during the turn-out by the journeymen. In London and the parts adjacent, however, the most friendly relations existed between masters and men; but it was also shown, on inquiry into fourteen workshops, that the proportion of apprentices to journeymen was only 37 to 216.</P><EPB/><PB N="clxxxviii"/><P>These combinations existed until the year 1802, when the journeymen first applied to the House of Commons for redress, and "the moment they found their petition entertained, and felt any ground of hope that their grievances would be fairly considered, all combination ceased, and their reliance for redress was entirely founded upon the justice and liberality of Parliament."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS523">The words are Sheridan's.  Compare also Report, p. 6.</NOTE1></P><P>The Committee appointed by the House made an excellent Report on the evidence which it had taken, and warmly recommended measures for the relief of the Calico-printers.  The Report dwelt specially on the fact, that the legislation of the then last years for the working-classes "had operated only in favour of the strong and against the weak."  "Everything," it says, "is made subservient to the interest of the masters, and exclusively too; for the diminution of expense, considerable as it is, the manufacture arising out of their multiplication of apprentices at reduced wages, and the introduction of machinery, do not appear to have produced any reduction whatever in the price of the fabric to the consumer."  Mr. Sheridan brought in a Bill in accordance with this Report, proposing (among other things) to lessen the number of apprentices.  Parliament, however, refused the Bill a second reading, especially on a speech of Sir Robert Peel (the father), who opposed it in the name of the masterprinters. He was a party to the question, as the evidence shows, for his manufactory at Church Bank, in Lancashire, was as overstocked with apprentices as those of other employers.  This refusal caused the revival of Trade-Unions among the journeymen Calico-printers; and it is worth mentioning, that the precarious condition of the apprentices themselves caused them even later on, in 1831, to form a Trade-Society of their own,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS524">See the account of the Young Society of Block-Printers in Manchester, in the essay <HI1 REND="i">On Combinations of Trades</HI1>, pp. 73-76.  London, 1831.</NOTE1>which was to assist and supplement the Trade-Society of the journeymen in their endeavours, just as the journeymen's fraternities of the fifteenth century on the Continent supplemented the Craft-Gilds.</P><P>As regards the Cotton-trade, I have not been able to find accounts of the first Trade-Societies among its journeymen.  But the following statement about it agrees with what occurred in all other trades, when the exceedingly well-informed author of the essay <HI1 REND="i">On Combinations of Trades</HI1> says (p. 15), "that this manufacture, which was of too modern an origin to be obnoxious to the 5th Eliz. c. 4, was never without unions among its artisans." An early organization of the journeymen Cotton-workers may also be inferred from the evidence contained in a Parliamentary Report <EPB/><PB N="clxxxix"/>of 1811.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS525"><HI1 REND="i">Report on Petitions of Several Weavers</HI1>, June 13th, 1811.</NOTE1>  It is said there, that for seventy years statement-lists of prices had existed in that trade, which were agreed upon by masters and men, and that they had been given up thirteen years before, by which great misery had been caused to the workmen.</P><P>Though the examples mentioned sufficiently prove my assertion as to the origin of Trade-Unions, I will yet give an account of the Trade-Societies in the Silk-manufacture; for the real nature of Trade-Unions comes out nowhere more clearly than here. Already before 1773 the assessment of wages by justices of the peace or by the Lord Mayor had fallen into disuse in the silk-manufacture in London, Westminster, Middlesex, and within the liberties of the Tower of London.  In consequence, the competition of employers to undersell each other had lowered the wages of workmen.  This led to continual differences as to wages between masters and men.  Several deeds of violence were committed by the exasperated workmen, and much property belonging to those employers who would not pay the customary wages was destroyed.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS526"><HI1 REND="i">Minutes of Evidence taken before the Committee to consider of the Several Petitions relating to the Ribbon Weavers</HI1>, March 18th, 1818, p. 40.</NOTE1>  Strikes were frequent; and the men on strike were assisted by contributions from all the workmen of the trade.  They chose a committee for managing all matters connected with the trade.  But when the committee once ordered a levy of 2<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> for every loom used by a workman, quarrels ensued with the masters, which finally led to the enactment of the 13th Geo. III. c. 68.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS527"><HI1 REND="i">Second Report of Minutes of Evidence</HI1>, April 20th and 28th, and May 8th, 1818, p. 57.</NOTE1>  According to this Act, the justices of the peace or the Lord Mayor at the above-named places were, from July 1st, 1773—from time to time, after demand so to do had been made to them—to assess the wages of the journeymen in the silk-manufacture.  Employers giving more or less than the assessed wages to their workmen, or evading the Act, as well as journeymen entering into combinations to raise wages, were to pay certain fines, the amount of which, after the deduction of the necessary expenses, was to be applied to the relief of needy weavers and their families.  By the 32nd Geo. III. c. 44, of the year 1792, these regulations were extended to the manufactories of silk mixed with other materials; and by the 51st Geo. III. c. 7, of 1811, to the female workers in the respective trades.  These three Acts were called the Spitalfields Acts.</P><P>After the enactment of the first Spitalfields Act, no more strikes <EPB/><PB N="cxc"/>took place in Spitalfields.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS528"><HI1 REND="i">Minutes</HI1>, p. 40; <HI1 REND="i">Second Report</HI1>, p. 194.</NOTE1>  Masters and men were unanimous in their praise of the effects of these Acts; and an employer even declared, that in case of their repeal, he would instantly retire from the trade.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS529">If the Spitalfields' Acts should be repealed, "I should in all probability leave the trade, and for this reason: I allude to no individual, but I have sufficient experience of human nature, and I have seen enough to know, that there are many people who would so oppress the poor to get goods manufactured very cheap, that I should not have a disposition to enter into competition with them, and I should in all probability retire from the trade."

Yet this case was evidently a rare one, as is proved by the rule of the statutes, that in case of more than one journeyman being out of work, the sum which was to be applied to the assistance of men out of work should not be augmented, but equally distributed between them.  This proves therefore, apart from the distinct evidence on the point, that after the enactment of the Spitalfields Acts no more strikes occurred; that strikes were not the object of the society.  And indeed, as the journeymen could protect their interests at law, there was no room for strikes.  If differences broke out between masters and men, the latter chose a committee <HI1 REND="i">ad hoc</HI1>, which was <EPB/><PB N="cxci"/>again dissolved after the case had been settled.  The journeymen sometimes also elected on this committee masters who had before been workmen themselves, and who, even after their rise, had known how to preserve the confidence of their former associates. This committee prosecuted, in the name of the journeymen, those employers who violated the said Acts.  It represented them also whenever a new price-list had to be fixed.  In opposition to this society of the journeymen the employers formed another, with the object of defending its members in court when prosecuted by the journeymen.  It also represented the masters on the settlement of a new price-list.  Whenever such a new price-list was to be fixed, the committees of both societies met; and after an agreement as to the prices had been come to, the committee of the journeymen brought the change, or the new regulation, before the magistrates to receive their sanction.  The complaint of the employers, that the magistrates regulated the prices always more according to the statements of the workmen than according to theirs, proves that the journeymen were not badly off under these legal regulations of prices.  Sometimes, also, such new regulations led to discussions before the magistrates.  But "in most cases," says a master silk-manufacturer, "where a dispute as to the fixing of prices has occasioned a discussion before the magistrates, it has arisen from the contending masters not being operative weavers; there would not then (i. e. if they had been operative weavers) be such disputes as there have been, as the masters were not capable of answering those articles which the journeymen have put them."  On the 4th of December, 1813, the journeymen's society consisted of 83 members, and was in possession of £5 8<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> 11 1/2<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>  In October, 1817, its finances seem to have been embarrassed.  It accordingly circulated an address to its members, calling for contributions.  This address gives at the same time an account of the society's operations.  "Within the last nine months upwards of fifty persons (by means of the Trade-Society) have obtained the lawful prices of their work, which was withheld from them to a very great extent by their employers; the expenses of obtaining which, with other things, have borne so heavy upon your finances, that you are embarrassed to a very large amount."</P><P>After a contest of almost a hundred years—for the violations of the 5th Eliz. c. 4 began about the eighteenth century—the master-manufacturers at last obtained the victory in 1814.  For the woollen manufacture the Statute of Apprentices had previously been repealed; by the 54th Geo. III. e. 96 the industrial system, which was as old as the Craft-Gilds, was abolished for all trades.  Indubitably, the condition of things before this repeal <EPB/><PB N="cxcii"/>had become untenable; for whilst the law was nominally in force, it was practically not observed.  All agreed, therefore, that a new law had become necessary. But whilst some wished for the amendment of the statute, others desired its entire repeal.  Petitions were presented to Parliament by the followers of both views.  But whilst 300,000 were for the maintenance of the statute, there were but 2000 for its repeal.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS535"><HI1 REND="i">Hansard</HI1>, vol. xxvii. p. 574.</NOTE1>  A Parliamentary Committee was appointed in 1813 to inquire into the facts of the question. All witnesses examined were against the repeal.  The arguments of the workmen brought round to their side even the Chairman of the Committee, who had formerly been little inclined to their views.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS536"><HI1 REND="i">Ibid.</HI1> p. 570.</NOTE1>  The workmen's petitions also laid particular stress on the point, that by the thitherto prevailing laws the journeymen lawfully educated for their trade had acquired a right similar to property, and that the repeal of the statute of Elizabeth would be to them what the deprivation of land or any other property would be to owners thitherto protected by the laws.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS537">See <HI1 REND="i">Report from the Committee on the Petitions of Watchmakers of Coventry,&amp;c.</HI1> , July 11, 1817, p. 47.</NOTE1>And, indeed, in this the workmen were right.  For what else is land but an opportunity of getting an income? and what else had the journeymen acquired by their seven years' apprenticeship, and by the expenses incurred for their education in the trade, but the opportunity of getting an income? and does not our age, which on expropriations pays compensations to landowners for the loss of this opportunity, owe such compensations also to those journeymen; at the least to the amount of the cost incurred by their education to their trades during the seven years required?  But we acknowledge only rights of capital, and these only when they are fixed in saleable commodities.</P><P>The debates in Parliament on the repeal of the statute show as its enemies, either employers or mere theoreticians, who, with the entire superciliousness of the followers of a still young theory, spoke with contempt of the glorious reign of Queen Elizabeth as of the time when nothing was yet known of the infallible doctrine of the new era.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS538">Compare <HI1 REND="i">Hansard</HI1>, vol. xxvii. pp. 564, 572, 884.</NOTE1>  It is remarkable, however, that these enlightened adherents of the new theory differed from Adam Smith in his justification of combinations of workmen.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS539"><HI1 REND="i">Hansard</HI1>, vol. xxvii. p. 572.</NOTE1>The employers, on the other hand, described this openly as a chief reason for the repeal of the statute, that the seven years' apprenticeship restricted the number of workmen, and thereby enabled them to combine with success against their masters.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS540"><HI1 REND="i">Ibid.</HI1> vol. xxvi. p. 213.</NOTE1><EPB/><PB N="cxciii"/>The spirit of the repealers may be seen by the assertion, that "the persons most competent to form regulations with respect to trade were the master-manufacturers."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS541"><HI1 REND="i">Hansard</HI1>, vol. xxvii. p. 572.</NOTE1>  Thus at last the statute was repealed in the interest of the employers.</P><P>I am not going to criticise further here the repeal of the 5th Eliz. c. 4, but I may be allowed a word on the dodge of the cry against State or Government interference by which this repeal was carried, and so many other regulations of trade desired by the workmen were refused.  It seems to me, on the contrary, that this repeal was an interference; and I can also imagine refusals of such regulations, which would constitute interferences.  For what does interference mean?  Evidently an unjust meddling with the affairs of another.  But what is the State, and what is Government; or rather, what ought they to be?  The State is the organization of the people, and Government the natural centre of popular life.  When this is really the case, there can be no question of State interference, so long as the State fulfils the will of the people.  For nobody who acts according to his own will can be said to interfere with himself.  The whole term "State interference" presupposes therefore a condition of the State as it ought not to be; it presupposes a State which is something else than the organization of the people, a government which is not the natural centre of popular life; both, something foreign to the people.  And such <HI1 REND="i">was</HI1> the State when the 5th Eliz. c. 4 was repealed, and when those regulations of trade were refused.  If it had been otherwise, it would not have acted in favour of the 2000 against the interests of the 300,000; and, in the case of those refusals, not against the expressed will of the majority of the interested part of the people.  This repeal, and these refusals, were acts of interference on the part of a minority with the wishes of the people.  And, indeed, the then existing Parliament did not even nominally represent the latter. This was also shown by the debates on the repeal.  A general want of interest prevailed on the deliberation of a law of such grave importance to the life of the people; the House was even counted out.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS542"><HI1 REND="i">Ibid.</HI1> vol. xxviii. p. 14.</NOTE1></P><P>The repeal of the 5th Eliz. c. 4 declared the state of industrial disorganization and disorder as the only lawful state.  This state became only too soon the prevailing one in all trades. Parliamentary reports<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS543">See the two above-referred-to <HI1 REND="i">Reports on the State of the Ribbon Trade</HI1>(p. clxxxix, notes 1, 2).</NOTE1> on the condition of the ribbon-trade and the silk-manufacture at Coventry, Nuneaton, and Macclesfield, describe, as the immediate consequence of the repeal, such a <EPB/><PB N="cxciv"/>growth of the system of sweaters and half-pay apprentices, that the journeymen were driven to famine, and the female workers to prostitution.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS544"><HI1 REND="i">Minutes of Evidence on the Ribbon Trade</HI1>, March 18, 1818, pp. 5, 24, 33.</NOTE1> "Whilst the statute of the 5th Eliz. was in force," says the Report, "the distressing circumstances now complained of never occurred."  The whole of the masters and weavers, therefore, petitioned in 1818 for the extension of the Spitalfields Acts to the silk-trade in the said places.  Reports of the years 1817 and 1818 give an absolutely identical account of the condition of the Watchmakers at Coventry.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS545"><HI1 REND="i">Report from the Committee on the Petitions of Watchmakers at Coventry, &amp;c.</HI1>, July 11, 1817; Report from the Select Committce to consider the Laws relating to Watchmakers, March 18, 1818.</NOTE1>  Further, as the justices of the peace no longer assessed wages after having heard masters and men, the workmen now endeavoured to introduce regulation of wages by statement-lists of prices, agreed upon by masters and men.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS546">Compare especially, as to the Silk-weavers of Macclesfield, the <HI1 REND="i">Second Report on the Ribbon Trade</HI1> referred to; moreover, the <HI1 REND="i">Report on Petitions of Several Weavers</HI1>, June 13, 1811.</NOTE1>  But they were violated upon every occasion by the employers.  The words which Pitt<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS547">I quote from Mr. Maxwell's speech, May 15, 1834, <HI1 REND="i">Hansard</HI1>, Third Series, vol. xxiii. p. 1091.</NOTE1> spoke on the subject of the Arbitration Act were now completely fulfilled. "The time will come," he said, "when manufactures will have been so long established, and the operatives not having any other business to flee to, that it will be in the power of any one man in a town to reduce the wages, and all the other manufacturers must follow.  If ever it does arrive at this pitch, Parliament, if it be not then sitting, ought to be called together, and if it cannot redress your grievances, its power is at an end.  Tell me not that Parliament cannot—it is omnipotent to protect."  The workmen were quite of the opinion of Pitt, and numberless were the petitions which, after 1814, they addressed to Parliament for the legal regulation of their trades.  But as Parliament thought it could not redress their grievances, they tried selfhelp. After the repeal of the Act of Elizabeth combinations and unions therefore arose in all trades.  But whilst, on the one hand, the workmen were refused legal protection, self-help, in consequence of the 39th and 40th Geo. III. c. 106, was considered a crime.  In 1818, bail to the amount of £200, and two sureties for £100 each, were required for the appearance of a common workman at the next Session to answer a charge of combining.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS548"><HI1 REND="i">Report of the Artisans' Committee</HI1>, 1824, p. 405.</NOTE1>  The greatest mischief was, however, that the Combination Laws, by confounding right and wrong, led men to <EPB/><PB N="cxcv"/>regard with less aversion things really vicious.  The people, in their despair, did not shrink from the greatest deeds of violence and the most infamous crimes, in self-defence.  The Combination Laws had deteriorated the character of the people to such a degree, that even after their repeal in 1824 such deeds of violence still occurred, as was disclosed by the Cotton-spinners' trial at Glasgow in 1838; and in several trades the instances descend, as we all know, to the latest times.</P><P>I will now briefly sum up the evidence with regard to the origin of Trade-Unions, supplied by this sketch of the condition of the workmen in the several trades during their transition from small to great industry.  We see first that the old regulations of trade by the Craft-Gilds and by the 5th Eliz. c. 4—which had originally been ordained in the interest of the public for securing good quality of work—now appear as really framed for the "better relief and comodytie of the poorer sorte."  Wherever an alteration of the order established by them occurred, the artisans and small masters were menaced in their secure and well-to-do situation, and the harmony between masters and men was destroyed.  And as soon as attempts were made to abolish this order, and legal protection was refused, the men combined for its maintenance.  I refer to the instances of the combinations of the Framework-knitters in 1710, of the Clothworkers in 1720 and 1756, and to the London Silk-weavers before the enactment of the Spitalfields Acts.  And, indeed, in the time after the repeal of the Statute of Apprentices it was notorious<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS549">Compare the <HI1 REND="i">Second Report on the Ribbon Trade of 1818</HI1>, p. 60.</NOTE1> that wherever labour was not regulated by law, or by an order agreed upon by masters and men, combinations of workmen prevailed.</P><P>As soon as the disorganization spread and the gravest abuses became general, whilst the prospect of a maintenance of order by the State disappeared, the workmen formed their Trade-Unions against the aggressions of the then rising manufacturing lords, as in earlier times the old freemen formed their Frith-Gilds against the tyranny of medieval magnates, and the free handicraftsmen their Craft-Gilds against the aggressions of the Old-burghers. And like the objects of those Gilds, the object of the Trade-Unions was the maintenance of independence, and of an entire system of order, in a time of industrial and social clublaw. The Clothworkers give an example of this.  Already, in 1796, the non-observance of the 5th Eliz. c. 4 had become so general in the cloth trade, that the trustees of the cloth-halls at Leeds admitted to them masters who had served no apprenticeship. <EPB/><PB N="cxcvi"/>And in the same year there arose a Trade-Society of workmen for the maintenance of the customary order.  Thus also originated the Congress of the Hatters, the Union of the Calico-printers, and the rest of the above-mentioned Trade-Societies.</P><P>But these societies arose only when those who had hitherto been obliged to protect the order of the trade refused this protection. Thus the Stocking-makers' Association for Mutual Protection was only formed after the London Framework-knitters' Company had proved itself either unwilling or insufficient to maintain the regulations of the trade.  The Clothworkers formed an Institution in 1803 only, when the trustees of the cloth-halls had ceased to perform their duty.  But as soon as the trustees again showed themselves ready to fulfil that duty, the Institution was dissolved.  And with this agrees Sheridan's account of the combinations of the Calico-printers.  The societies themselves also only resorted to self-help to maintain their regulations when legal aid was denied them.  Thus Trade-Unions arose in all trades under the 5th of Elizabeth, first, for the legal prosecution of employers who had violated this Act; and, indeed, in the silk-trade the Trade-Society existed merely for the better execution of the Spitalfields Acts.  On the other hand, we find incendiarism by the Clothworkers on the suspension of the 5th of Elizabeth, and riots of the Framework-knitters on the refusal of protection by the legislature.</P><P>Originally the organization of the Trade-Society comprehended all the workers of a trade in the place: thus was it with the Silk-weavers, with the Calico-printers, with the Institution of the Clothworkers. Likewise the amount of contributions depended originally on the free-will of the members.  It is only later that we find closer and more restricted associations among the more zealous, and fixed contributions.  As combinations of workmen were prohibited, especially after the 39th and 40th George III. c. 106, Benefit-Societies were frequently made the cloak of Trade-Societies. Such Trade-Societies were the Friendly-Society of the Clothworkers in 1802, the Benefit-Club of the Liverpool Shipwrights, the Scissor-smiths' Benefit-Society at Sheffield: and indeed this was almost the rule until 1824.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS550">See the ninth resolution of the Committee of the House of Commons in 1824.</NOTE1>  During the whole of the Middle Ages after Charlemagne, the Political Gilds abroad concealed themselves in like manner under cover of the Religious Gilds.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS551">See Pertz, vol. i. p. 68, cap. 10.  Ouin-Lacroix, pp. 423-425, cites a series of prohibitions of Religious Gilds by councils, kings, and barons, because they were <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"conjurationes vel conspirationes laicorum, quibus nomen confraternitatis imponunt, impietatem pollicentes sub nomine pietatis."</FOREIGN></NOTE1><EPB/><PB N="cxcvii"/>Mr.  Dunning's account of the London Bookbinders' Society shows also that societies first instituted merely for the purpose of "taking a social pint of porter together," changed afterwards into Trade-Societies.  Such changes of Friendly-Societies may often have happened.  I have pointed in Part IV. to the similar transformations of Religious into Craft-Gilds.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS552">See p. cxviii, above.</NOTE1>  If in the times of the Craft-Gilds in England journeymen's Associations had existed there like those on the Continent, there can be no doubt that later on Trade-Unions would also have arisen from those Associations.  I have already referred in Part IV.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS553">See pp. clix, clx, above.</NOTE1> to the different points by which this opinion can be supported.  The Trade-Society of the Calico-printers also showed similar regulations to those that prevailed in the German journeymen's Associations.</P><P>The rules of Trade-Societies cited in the foregoing pages are still very imperfect.  Yet even they show the essence of the Gilds as defined in Part I.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS554">See p. lxvii, above.</NOTE1>  Like the oldest Gild-Statutes, they show merely the outlines of an organization.  The system is not yet worked out into details.  But if one considers the statutes of one of our modern Trade-Unions, as, for instance, those of the Amalgamated Engineers, one finds an organization elaborated into the minutest details, which is very similar to the later Craft-Gilds. It would be very interesting to show from the history of this queen of Trade-Unions, which now (like the Hanse in former times) has its ramifications in all parts of the world, how its organization gradually developed itself in the same phases as that of the old Gilds did.  Attempts at General Trade-Associations by the Trade-Unions were also not wanting, quite as vain and short-lived as the German Town-Confederations.  I refer to the National Association for the Protection of Labour of 1830, and to the later similar experiment of Thomas Duncombe.  It would also be very interesting to show how the workmen, after the disuse of the customary regulations of wages, laboured continually to bring about an orderly condition of wages by statement-lists of prices; how they were constantly opposed in this, on principle, by the employers, who would not suffer restrictions where they considered themselves as alone having rights, until, in consequence of the threatening attitude of the workmen, they have, since the example set by Mr. Mundella, agreed at last to an institution which is nothing but an amended edition of the regulation of wages by the Craft-Gilds.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS555">See pp. cxxxvi, cxl, note 2, above.  It appears from the <HI1 REND="i">Report on the Petitions of Several Weavers</HI1>, June 13th, 1811, that statement-lists of prices, agreed on by masters and men, existed early in the eighteenth century in the Cotton-trade. About the beginning of this century they fell into disuse.  Masters and men therefore petitioned Parliament in 1811 for the appointment of a Committee, consisting of both parties, which from time to time should regulate wages, and which would have been very similar to the boards of arbitration of Mr. Mundella or Mr. Kettle.</NOTE1>  And in some noble instances <EPB/><PB N="cxcviii"/>we already see the return to the sharing of profits with the workmen, as it existed in Bruges before the degeneration of the Craft-Gilds.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS556">See p. cxxxvi, above.</NOTE1>  I believe that to show this would not only produce a "dim" consciousness that "the world is settling into a new order after more or less of disorder,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS557">Mr. Congreve in the <HI1 REND="i">Fortnightly Review</HI1>, New Series, vol. v. p. 417.</NOTE1> but that it would prove that social order has to a great extent already taken the place of disorder.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS558">Consider also the account of the Trade-Union of the "Knights of St. Crispin" in Massachusetts in the article in the <HI1 REND="i">Spectator</HI1>, Dec. 11, 1869, on "The Workmen's Revolt in Massachusetts."</NOTE1>  But to prove this in detail would require special essays which cannot be added here.</P><P>I shall be satisfied now if I have proved that the spread of disorder called forth at once in each single trade Gild-like organizations of those suffering by it, to maintain the old order, or to create a new one.  I wish only further to point to the fact that the English, among whom the old Gilds probably originated, have in this new movement again preceded all other nations.  As each new political era has begun in England—whether they were barons who wrung from King John the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Magna Charta Libertatum</FOREIGN>, or the middle-classes who in the seventeenth century obtained here first the dominion in the State—so the era of the working-classes comes first to development on English soil.  And as in the earlier Middle Ages from the days of Charlemagne the Frith-Gilds, and in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Craft-Gilds, so now the Trade-Unions will be the great engines for obtaining the sway.  Already since 1824 they have enjoyed a kind of recognition; and already they have fought contests quite as fierce as, if not fiercer than, those of the old craftsmen against the patricians.  The history of their sufferings since the end of the eighteenth century, and of the privations endured for their independence, is a real record of heroism.  It is only to be hoped that now, when they are free from all legal restrictions, they may use only—instead of the arms of violence, which belong to former times—the legal means which belong to our days, and which are thrown open to them by the franchise.  May the English working-men, like the English barons and middle-classes in former times, be a bright example in the attainment of freedom to their brethren on the Continent!</P></DIV2><EPB/><PB N="cxcix"/><CLOSER>P.S.

In every other place throughout the return, 'y' is used for the <HI1 REND="i">one-letter</HI1> sound of 'th.'  In other returns, sometimes 'þ' is used, sometimes 'y;' but whichever is used, it is constant throughout the same return. <HI1 REND="i">Second</HI1>, in this return alone is it stated, though the <HI1 REND="i">fact</HI1> was probably the same in every gild, that the offerings at the dirge were to be spent in buying bread to be given to the poor.  (Compare the return No. XLVI.)  And the bread so bought is to be 'wyht-al' or 'wastel' bread, that is, bread 'white and well baked.'  In other words, the dole to the poor shall be of eatable bread of the best quality, and not 'cocket' (seconds) or 'simnel' (twice baked) bread.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS632">In a vocabulary of the early part of the fifteenth century, contained in Mr. Mayer's privately printed volume of Vocabularies, no less than twelve sorts of bread are named (pp. 197, 198).  But among these there are many of very coarse quality, and not made from wheat.  Wastel, cocket, and simnel are the only sorts recognized in the "Assise of Bread." In the Vision of Piers Plowman, the contrast between the sorts of bread is strongly put.  Piers tells Hunger that, <Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L>"A lof of Benes and Bren, I bake for my children;"</L></Q1> but adds that, after harvest, <Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L>"Ne no Beggare eten Bread, þat Benes inne come, </L><L>Bote Cocket and Cler Matin, an of clene whete."</L></Q1><BIBL>(Mr. Skeat's edition of the Vernon Text, pp. 89, 90.)</BIBL>  See further, the Note at the end of the "Usages of Winchester," in Part III. of this work.</NOTE1>  The word 'wastel' is no doubt (by the very common transposition of the 's') the Old Northern 'veitsla' (feast), the wastel bread being what should always be given to guests.  'Veitslu-dagr' is <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">dies epularis.</FOREIGN></P><P>These two sentences seem to me to shew that part at least of the ordinances found in this return were copied from the now lost ordinances of some gild much older than the date when this one itself began.</P></DIV3></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:4.40" TYPE="return"><EPB/><PB N="103"/><HEAD>XXXIX. <LB/><SUPPLIED>GILD OF ST.

(A.D. 1389), from which the whole of those contained in Part I. are taken.  But none of the Returns used in this Part were made in English. They were made either in Latin, or in the old Law-French.  I have translated the substance of them more or less fully in each case, according as the original throws more or less light upon the usages and character of English Gilds, and so upon the Ordinances contained in Part I.  A note is here added in each case, as in Part I., stating the bundle, number, and condition of the Return used.</P><P>A few instances are taken from other sources than those bundles of Returns, though still from documents in the Public Record Office.  I give these in order to illustrate, as well the character of the Gilds themselves, as the existence of other important means, besides the Returns here chiefly used, of obtaining a knowledge of the old Gilds.  Some, again, are taken from sources other than the Public Record Office, the source of each being acknowledged in its place.  In both the cases where I have thus gone outside the Returns made in 1389, several of the originals are found in English, but some are in Latin, and some in the old Law-French.</P><P>The important, and hitherto wholly unknown, illustrations (in English) which I have been happy enough to recover from their long hiding-place among the old records of the city of Exeter, and which are here printed, stand out conspicuously among the rest, as well for their intrinsic interest, as for the strong light which they throw on the connection between the old Gilds and the Corporate Bodies of Cities and Towns.</P><P>This Part II. begins with the Writs sent round, at the end of 1388, to all the Sheriffs in England, to make proclamation for the sending up of the Returns called for by the Parliament of Cambridge.  The illustrations that follow are, with one exception, arranged in a rough geographical order, beginning in the North.  The one exception is the Gild of Berwick-upon-Tweed; which I put last of all because the <HI1 REND="i">Latin</HI1> original was printed in Germany in 1831, being, so far as I am aware, the only document used in this volume that had ever been printed, either in England or elsewhere, before the present work was begun.  It will be seen that the Return made by The Great Gild of the Hans-House of Beverley is no exception to the originality of the documents now for the first time used.  The Gild of Berwick-upon-Tweed is here used, because it serves well to illustrate the relations in which the old Gilds so often stood to the organic Commonalty, or Body Corporate, of the place; as is further done by Gilds that will be found under the heads of Lancaster, Birmingham, Bristol, &amp;c., as well as by the very complete case of Exeter.</P></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:5.2" TYPE="documents"><EPB/><PB N="127"/><HEAD>I. <LB/>WRITS TO THE SHERIFF OF EVERY SHIRE IN ENGLAND, TO MAKE PROCLAMATION THAT RETURNS SHALL BE SENT UP BY ALL THE GILDS.</HEAD><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.2.1" TYPE="writ"><HEAD>(<HI1 REND="i">a</HI1>) THE WRIT FOR RETURNS FROM THE SOCIAL GILDS.</HEAD><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS661">CCCIX. 1.

And one, and in some cases both, of the original Writs thus sent out, are still extant for a few places, besides London and Worcestershire.  Those place are, Bristol (<HI1 REND="i">social</HI1>), Cambridgeshire (<HI1 REND="i">crafts</HI1>), Cornwall (<HI1 REND="i">both</HI1>), Derby (<HI1 REND="i">social</HI1>), Lincolnshire (<HI1 REND="i">social</HI1>), Northamptonshire (<HI1 REND="i">both</HI1>), Rutland (<HI1 REND="i">both</HI1>), Southamptonshire (<HI1 REND="i">both</HI1>), Surrey and Sussex [as one shire<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS672">Surrey and Sussex were generally treated, till quite a modern time, as one shire.

Most of them are in bad condition.  The fewness of the Writs that thus remain to us, tells the same tale of loss as does the fewness of the Returns that remain to us out of all that were in fact sent up from the Gilds.  The number of those Returns that now remain, may be safely taken to stand in about the same proportion to the number of Returns that were originally sent up, as the number of the Writs that now remain stands to the number of Writs which we absolutely know were originally sent out to every Sheriff in England.</P><P>It is well worth attention, that not only do the terms of both these Writs distinctly affirm, twice over, that they are issued only by authority of Parliament, but there is incidental proof that this fact was thoroughly understood by those to whom they were sent.  The Sheriff's Returns to the Wiltshire Writs, setting forth the places and times of the proclamations, were made on separate pieces of parchment <UNCLEAR>?</UNCLEAR>, though tacked to the original Writs.  One of these Returns is thus indorsed:<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED">—"12 R. 2, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">apud Westmonasterium: 1 November: de Proclamacione facienda, auctoritate Parliamenti, de Gildis et ffraternitatibus, eorum terris et Tenementis</FOREIGN>, &amp;c."</Q1></P><P>Most of the Sheriffs' Returns as to the proclamations made, are indorsed upon the back of the original Writ; but some are, as in the case of Wiltshire, written on a separate slip of parchment [?], which is tacked to the original Writ.</P><P>In going carefully through these original Writs, I found a remarkable fact, before unknown; namely, that several of them, and also some of the separate Sheriffs' Returns, are written upon linen paper.  Paper was, it is well known, made and used before this time; but it was not known, before I observed these facts, that it was ever used in England for writs issued out of the Chancery; nor has the kind of paper which I thus found, been ever before described (except by myself), or been 
<EPB/><PB N="133"/>
even known to have existed. It is of the colour and stoutness, and has the general appearance and touch, of parchment; but the wire marks of the linen fabric that forms its basis are plainly to be seen on a careful examination.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS673">These wire marks are wholly different from the lines often found on parchment, which are made in the course of the tooling it undergoes to fit it for being written on.</NOTE1>  It is, however, so like parchment that an ordinary handling of it would not lead to the suspicion that it is not parchment, like the rest among which it is found.  No other instance of the use of this paper for official, or indeed for any, purposes, is at present known. None of it is found used in any of the Returns that were sent up, in compliance with these Writs, by the Gilds themselves; and I have been assured, by those habitually familiar with our old records, that they have never met with examples of this remarkable paper.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS674">This does not, however, prove that it does not exist; as it is only in a good and oblique light, and on very careful handling, that the wire marks can be well seen.  Search should be made in and between September and November 1388, for I think the original of the Writ given below, as to the Wardon share of expenses of the knights of the shire, is also made of the same paper.  It is certain that attempts were made, not far from this time, to manufacture artificial parchment.  See Mr. Way's note to the word "Sabrace," in <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Promptorium parvulorum</FOREIGN> (Camden Society), p. 440.</NOTE1>  It seems probable that some ingenious person hit upon this substitute for parchment, to meet some emergency, and made a small quantity, but that the process was too costly to be continued after the emergency had been met.  There is not, however, in the history of paper-making, a more curious, nor, at present, a more unknown chapter, than the paper which my searches among the records of the English Gilds have thus brought to light.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS675">See before, p. 44, <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>.  I have tried some experiments as to how such a paper as this might be made; and I have succeeded in producing several specimens closely resembling it, and much more like parchment, and much easier to write on, than what is now made and sold as artificial parchment.  The facts as to the before unknown paper thus found by me at the Public Record Office, were made generally known at the beginning of 1865, upon the suggestion of one who was better entitled than any other man in England to express an opinion on such a subject.</NOTE1></P><P>A curious incidental proof of the neglect with which the bundles of records so largely used in this volume have been treated through five centuries,—proving indeed that they can never have been read through at all by any one, since the Returns were made, until I undertook the task,—is found in the fact that, among the Writs above named, there is one touching, at first sight, a very different subject, and which certainly ought to be in a very different place. It is a Writ for the recovery, from 
<EPB/><PB N="134"/>
one Township in one Hundred in Northamptonshire, of its rateable share towards the expenses of the knights of the shire in Parliament. The matter is not, however, without a significant relation to the subject of English Gilds; the fundamental idea of Parliamentary representation being, that every Constituency, like every Gild, has an associated interest, coupled with an associated obligation.  As the subject is, in itself, little understood, while it is of high constitutional importance, and as this Writ escaped even the researches of the lynx-eyed Prynne himself, who would have thoroughly rejoiced to have printed it had he found it, it is due to the Parliamentary History of England that I should give here what I have thus found so strangely interpolated among the fragmentary remains of the Returns sent up by the old Gilds.</P><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS676"><P>From the earliest beginnings of Parliamentary History in England, the expenses of members were defrayed by the organic commonalties that sent them.  What is called the "Reform Act" of 1832, gives us the first time that the Statute Book was disfigured by a thing so repugnant both to Common Law and Statute Law as that a seat in Parliament should be a matter of sale and purchase, and therefore of personal ownership.  See section 71 of that Act, and, further in the same direction, the Act 26 and 27 Vic. c. 29, sections 2-7.  Compare with these the very different spirit of the Acts 34 and 35 H. VIII. c. 24, and 35 H. VIII. c. 11; which were made, as both of them declare on their front, simply in accordance with the old and universal practice.  It would be interesting to know who now enjoys the estate which was settled, by the former of these two Acts, with the careful intention of providing for the Parliamentary payments due to the knights of the shire for Cambridge. </P><P>One of the most valuable and interesting of the many works written by that man of undaunted courage, unswerving integrity, and untiring industry, William Prynne, was the fourth volume of his Parliamentary Writs.  In it he dwells on the great importance of keeping alive the practice of paying the expenses of members of Parliament; and he there answers, in long anticipation, all, and more than all, that has been said, in later times, against such a practice. </P><P>Though Prynne did not know of the Writ given above, he was well aware of the principle of law which it so admirably illustrates; namely, that "every village was, of right, particularly taxed towards knights expenses."

Writs, vol. iv. p. 381.)</P></NOTE1></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.2.6" TYPE="writ"><HEAD>WRIT FOR LEVYING UPON ONE TOWNSHIP IN A SHIRE ITS SHARE OF THE EXPENSES OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.</HEAD><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS677">CCCIX. 102.

on the fourth day of June last past, we commanded you by our writ that you should cause to be paid, by the commonalty of the shire aforesaid, as well within liberty as without,—those cities and boroughs only being excepted<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS678">Because they separately paid their own members.</NOTE1> whence citizens and burgesses came to our Parliament which we caused to be summoned at Westminster on the morrow of the Purification of the blessed Mary last past—to <HI1 REND="i">Sir Egidius Mallorre</HI1>, and <HI1 REND="i">John Wydevylle</HI1>, Knights of the Shire, who came to the said Parliament for the commonalty of the said shire, forty-two pounds and sixteen shillings, for their expenses in coming to the said Parliament, in staying there, and in going back thence to their homes; as is recorded in the rolls of our Chancery: And now, on behalf of certain men of the Hundred of Wardon, much complaining, it has been shown to us that the township of Wardon, which is within the Hundred aforesaid, and which ought to pay towards these expenses of the Knights like as the other townships in the same Hundred do, and which has, from time beyond the memory of man, been accustomed to pay its right share of the expenses of the said Knights, has altogether refused to pay, to the manifest burthening of the other townships of the said Hundred, and the hindering of the settlement of the expenses aforesaid: And so they have besought us to find them redress.  Now we, being unwilling that the other townships of that Hundred should be burthened more than is accustomed, command you to enforce upon the said township of Wardon the payment of its share of these expenses of the Knights aforesaid, like as the other townships of the same Hundred have done, and as it has been accustomed from of old time to do, according to the quantity of the lands and tenements there, and their means.  And if the township shall still refuse to do this, then cause Robert Brewode, Stephen Hikkes, John Bole, and John Bocher, good men of the said township of Wardon,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="n2">There can be no doubt that the four "good men" thus named, were the "four" chosen, by the men of the place, to represent the township at the Hundred-mote, and for other purposes touching the common welfare of the place, during the year 1388.  I have elsewhere shown that this was the old (and thoroughly effective) practice throughout England.  See "The Parish" (second edition), pp. 16-19 (particularly p. 19), 121, 230.  I add here another illustration, which will be found in Manwood's "Forest Laws" (ed. 1615), p. 252:—"It is to be noted that all the freeholders within the forest, as wel Spirituall as Temporal, must in any wise appeare before the Justice seat, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">primo die Itineris</FOREIGN>.  And <SUPPLIED>also</SUPPLIED> of euerie towne, the Reue and foure men also with him, which is called <HI1 REND="i">prepositus et quatuor homines</HI1>, &amp;c."  It will thus be seen that neither the Reeve nor the four chosen men were necessarily "freeholders."  Domesday book, the <HI1 REND="i">Inquisitiones Nonarum</HI1>, and every other original authority, prove that the "villani," or occupiers of any sort, took their active part in the local affairs. There has been so much misrepresentation put forth on this subject by superficial writers, that the truth cannot be too often brought to notice.

And herein fail not at your peril.  And have with you there this writ.  Witness myself at Cambridge, the 17th day of September, in the twelfth year of our reign.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS679">This Writ was thus issued for recovery of the expenses of the Parliament held in the early part of the same year (1388) in which the Parliament of Cambridge was itself held, though, owing to the date of his accession, the former fell in the eleventh, and the latter in the twelfth, year of Richard II.  The year 1388 thus happened to be one of the many years when the "oftener if need be" was put in practice,—according to the old law of Edward III., that a Parliament shall be held "every year once, and oftener if need be."  Two Parliaments were held within that year, with, as was always then the case, a fresh election to each.  Sir Egidius Mallorre and John Wydevylle are named in Prynne's Parl. Writs, vol. iii. p. 122, as members of the first Parliament of 1388, but neither of them was sent to the second Parliament of that year  John Harowedon and John Mulsho were returned, in their stead, as members of the latter.  Prynne found, and has printed, the records of the Writs issued for payment of the expenses of both these pairs of members (see Parl. Writs, vol. iv. pp. 397, 403), though he did not find the Writ which I have translated above.</NOTE1></P><SIGNED>BURTONE.</SIGNED></DIV3></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:5.3" TYPE="city records"><EPB/><PB N="137"/><HEAD>II. <LB/>YORK.</HEAD><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.3.1" TYPE="gild records"><HEAD>(<HI1 REND="i">a</HI1>) GILD OF THE LORD'S PRAYER.</HEAD><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS680">CCCVIII. 109.  Condition, fair.  Latin.</NOTE1><P>As to the beginning of the said gild, be it known that, once on a time, a play, setting forth the goodness of the Lord's Prayer, was played in the city of York; in which play all manner of vices and sins were held up to scorn, and the virtues were held up to praise.  This play met with so much favour that many said:—"Would that this play could be kept up in this city, for the health of souls and for the comfort of the citizens and neighbours."  Hence, the keeping up of that play in times to come, for the health and amendment of the souls as well of the upholders as of the hearers<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS681"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Audientium"</FOREIGN> in the original.  This was therefore a spoken play, and not, as with the gild next following, a dumb show of set pieces in an array of pageants.  In each case, however, it is equally clear that the performance, or show, was made whilst passing along the streets.</NOTE1> of it, became the whole and sole cause of the beginning and fellowship of the bretheren of this brotherhood.  And so the main charge of the gild is, to keep up this play, to the glory of God, the maker of the said prayer, and for the holding up of sins and vices to scorn.  And because those who remain in their sins are unable to call God their father, therefore the bretheren of the gild are, first of all, bound to shun company and businesses that are unworthy, and to keep themselves to good and worthy businesses.  And they are bound to pray for the bretheren and sisteren of the gild, both alive and dead, that the living shall be able so to keep the gild that 



<EPB/><PB N="138"/>
they may deserve to win God's fatherhood, and that the dead may have their torments lightened.  Also, they are bound to come to the burial services of the dead bretheren and sisteren of the gild.  And if any one does not leave enough to meet the cost of such services, the rest of the bretheren shall bear that cost.  And if any brother dies and is buried away from the city, the bretheren shall hold services for him within the city of York. Also it is forbidden that any brother of the gild shall, in the belief that he will have help from his bretheren, be forward in getting into lawsuit or quarrel, or in upholding any wrongful cause whatever, upon pain of losing all help and friendship, or any relief, from the gild.  And because vain is the gathering of the faithful without some work of kindliness is done, therefore the bretheren have made this ordinance:—That if haply it befall that any of the bretheren be robbed, or his goods or chattels perchance be burned, or he be imprisoned for any wrongful cause, or be brought to want through any visitation of God, the other bretheren shall, for kindness' sake, help him according to his need, under the guidance of the wardens of the gild, so that he may not haply perish through lack of help.  Also, they are bound to find one candle-bearer, with seven lights, in token of the seven supplications in the Lord's Prayer; which candle-bearer shall hang in the cathedral church of York, and be lighted on Sundays and feast days, to the glory and honour of God Almighty, the maker of that prayer, of St. Peter the glorious confessor, of St. William, and of all saints.  Also they are bound to make, and as often as need be to renew, a table showing the whole meaning and use of the Lord's Prayer, and to keep this hanging against a pillar in the said cathedral church near to the aforesaid candle-bearer.  Also they are bound, as often as the said play of the Lord's Prayer is played in the city of York, to ride with the players thereof through the chief streets of the city of York; and, the more becomingly to mark themselves while thus riding, they must all be clad in one suit.  And, to ensure good order during the said play, some of the bretheren are bound to ride or to walk with the players until the play is wholly ended. <EPB/><PB N="139"/>And once in the year a feast shall be held, and fresh wardens shall be chosen by the gild, and a true account shall be given to the newly chosen wardens of all that has been done on behalf of the gild during the last year.  Also it is ordained, that no one shall be let come into this gild, until after he shall have been questioned by the wardens of the gild as to whether he has bent his will to live rightly, and so to deal towards the gild and its affairs that he may be at one with the wardens.  And because the founders of the said gild well knew that they themselves might not be wise enough to make, at once, all needful ordinances, therefore, at the end of the ordinances then made, they added this clause:—"Whensoever, and as often soever, as it may perchance happen that we or our successors, wardens and bretheren of this gild, may become wiser than we now are, none of us nor our successors shall be deemed a rebel, or as standing out against our wishes or against those of any of our successors, if haply we put forth, or there shall be put forth at any time hereafter, any new ordinance that will be for the greater glory of God or the welfare of this gild."  Under which saving clause other wardens of the gild have since added, that a chaplain shall, once a year, celebrate divine service before the gild, for the good of the bretheren and sisteren of the gild, alive and dead, and for that of all the good-doers to the gild.  Moreover, the bretheren are wont to meet together at the end of every six weeks, and to put up special prayers for the welfare of our lord the King and for the good governance of the kingdom of England, and for all the bretheren and sisteren of this gild, present and absent, alive and dead, and for all the good-doers to the gild or to the gildbretheren; and also, once in the year, to have a general service for the dead bretheren and sisteren.  There do not belong to the gild any rents of land, nor any tenements, nor any goods save only the properties needed in the playing of the before-named play; which properties are of little or no worth for any other purpose than the said play.  And the gild has one wooden chest, in which the said properties are kept.</P><P><SUPPLIED>It is added that,</SUPPLIED> as the seals of the wardens of the gild will be <EPB/><PB N="140"/>unknown to many, they have asked that the seal of the Vicar-General of the Archbishop of York shall be put to this return; which has accordingly been done, in witness to the truth of the return, on the 21st January, 1388 [9].</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.3.2" TYPE="editorial commentary"><HEAD TYPE="supplied">Editorial Commentary</HEAD><P><SUPPLIED>The people of York seem to have been fond of plays and pageants.  Though nothing more is found touching any of these in the Returns made by the gilds in 1389, there is, in the British Museum (Lansdowne MSS. 403), a volume containing the ordinances of a very famous gild of that city, which long kept up an extraordinary annual show of pageants.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS682">This MS. fills a parchment volume, eleven and a quarter inches long, by seven and a quarter wide, containing 154 leaves.  Besides what follows, it contains ten lists of jewels, &amp;c., belonging to the gild, and one list giving a "Memo<HI1 REND="sup">d</HI1> þt thes er þe personelles off Iowelles þt standethe vpon þe Schryne off corporis Christi."  There are also a few other unimportant documents.  The ordinances are in Latin.  It is clear that several copies of these ordinances, &amp;c., were formerly in existence; for Drake names one in his History of York (p. 246), which is certainly not the one that is now in the British Museum.</NOTE1>  It seems to have been founded by the priests of York; and these ordinances, instead of being written in the unadorned simplicity of those contained in Part I. of this work, and of most of the others that were sent up with them, show themselves to have been drawn up by some learned ecclesiastic, more anxious for the display of his rhetorical powers than to bring himself to the level of men of common sense.  They begin with a tedious scholastic disquisition upon the creation of man, the fall, what thence followed, the mystery of Christ as appearing in the flesh and in the eucharist, subtle illustrations of the unity of Christ's body and of the bretheren, and the seven rules of charity upon which it is declared that the Gild is founded.  Then follow the ordinances themselves; the marked meagreness of which shows that, though the priest who wrote them might be equal to all manner of scholastic subtleties, he was not able to bring himself to the level of the ordinary common sense and good feeling of the laity in framing a body of gild-ordinances.  The following is the substance of these ordinances:—</SUPPLIED></P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.3.3" TYPE="gild records"><EPB/><PB N="141"/><HEAD>(<HI1 REND="i">b</HI1>) GILD OF CORPUS CHRISTI.</HEAD><P>The brotherhood was begun A.D. 1408.</P><P>The first ordinance is, that on the feast of Corpus Christi, all the priests in their surplices, and the masters carrying white wands, shall go in stately procession, to the glory of God and of the city of York.</P><P>The second ordinance is, that six priests, bretheren of the fraternity, shall be yearly chosen <SUPPLIED>as Masters</SUPPLIED>.  Whoever refuses, shall pay xl.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> to the brotherhood.

They shall not be bound by any kind of oath, but shall of their own will come into the brotherhood, without any bond other than the bond of charity; charging, however, their consciences that, according to their means and power, they shall so do that their coming into the gild may enable the charges of the gild, and its worthy works, to be the better borne and kept up.</P><P>The fourth ordinance enjoins upon the priests the saying of daily prayers, and the performance of services after the death of any brother.</P><P>The fifth ordinance requires that the lay bretheren of the gild shall make offerings for the souls of the dead.  But it adds that, although laymen may come to the prayers, and be received into the gild, they shall not be let take any share in the councils or in the governance of the gild.  No lay folks shall be admitted to the gild, save only those belonging to some honest craft; but all, as well clerks as lay folks, and of both sexes, will be received, if of good fame and conversation.</P><P>The sixth ordinance fixes the regular payments to be made by the bretheren and sisteren; and requires that all shall, under penalty of a fine, come when summoned.  It also enjoins <EPB/><PB N="142"/>the holding of certain services, and that payments shall be made by the gild to those who officiate thereat.</P><P>The seventh ordinance treats of lights that are to be borne at times named, and of the annual payments that are to be made for these.  It goes on to forbid the coming of children or servants to the meetings of the gild.  The six masters of the past year are told to give what help they can to the newly chosen masters of each new year, with a special charge that they shall let them know the dwellings of the bretheren and sisteren from whom they are to get payments.  Twopence a day, or his food, shall be given to the collector; for (it is wisely said) "the laborer is worthy of his hire or his food."  And it is ordained that the six masters for the time being shall annually, in the presence of their six fore-runners, and of six or eight other priests, and not more, who have before been masters, give an account of the goods of the gild to those who are chosen to follow them.</P><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.3.3.1" TYPE="note"><HEAD>NOTE.—</HEAD><P>Though the character of these ordinances could not have drawn many to join the gild, the way in which a procession of pageants was got up by the many crafts of York, to join with the procession of the priests, gave to the gild an importance which it could not otherwise have reached.  The MS. in the British Museum shows that an extraordinary number, of both sexes, did join it.  No less than 270 pages of the folio volume are filled with the names of the bretheren and sisteren.  There are, on an average, fifty-five names on each page, thus making a total recorded number of bretheren and sisteren of not less than 14,850.  That this gild should have become so popular, can only be explained by two things: <HI1 REND="i">first</HI1>, the love of show and pageant which it gratified; <HI1 REND="i">second</HI1>, a departure from the very narrow spirit of the original ordinances.  That the latter underwent changes, is proved by a MS. in the Bodleian Library, which informs us that, when it was written (which was probably in the last years of Henry VIII. or first of Edward VI.), the gild had "a master and six priests, called the keepers of the said gild.  Which master and keepers be yerely removeable with the octabes of the feast of Corpus Christi; and have for themselves no allowance nor fees. [This is not true.]  Nevertheless, they are bound to keep a solempne procession, the sacrament being in a shryne born in the same through the city of York, yerely, the Fryday after Corpus Christi day; and, the day after, to have a solempne mass and dirige, to pray for the <EPB/><PB N="143"/>prosperity of brothers and sisters lyving and the souls departed; and to keep yerely ten poor folks, having, every of them, towards their lyvinge, by yere, iij.<HI1 REND="i">l.</HI1> vi.<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> viii.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>  And further they do find eight beds for poor people being strangers, and one poor woman to keep the said beds, by the yere, xiij.<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> iv.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS683">Quoted in Drake's "History of York," p. 246.</NOTE1></P><P>A memorandum left by an old town-clerk of York<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS684">Also quoted by Drake, Appendix, pp. xxx-xxxij.</NOTE1> shows that the procession which fills so humble a place in the "ordinances," was taken up with so much spirit by the lay craftsmen of York that, in 1415, no less than ninety-six separate crafts joined in it, and no less than fifty-four distinct pageants were prepared and presented in the procession by these crafts, while ten crafts made the show the more glorious by bearing a vast number of blazing torches.

These charters confirmed the liberties granted by the charters of Archbishops Thurstan and William, and also, in express terms, the rights of the Gild-Merchant to toll, Hanshouse, etc.  The object of the charter of Richard II. is, to re-affirm all the charters which it states to have been thus 'inspected.'<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS702">No mention is made, in Poulson's "Beverlac," of the confirmation by Pope Lucius; nor are the Letters Patent of Richard II. set forth in that elaborate and interesting work.</NOTE1></SUPPLIED></P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.4.4" TYPE="gild records"><EPB/><PB N="154"/><HEAD>(<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>) GILD OF CORPUS CHRISTI.</HEAD><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS703">CCCVIII. 110.

When, with the assent of the whole gild, any fresh man and wife enter the gild, they shall together pay two shillings and twopence yearly during their lives, and afterwards the survivor shall pay the same sum.  If an unmarried man or an unmarried woman enters the gild, each shall be bound to make the same yearly payment.

Each charges his estate with the payment of two shillings yearly to the gild, payable quarterly.  If any payment shall be eight days in arrear, the alderman may levy double the amount.

Even existing London City Companies have such patron saints.  Perhaps some local circumstances made the priests unpopular in Chesterfield.  Certain it is that, while the ordinances of the Chesterfield gild last given treat priestly services with a slightness and coldness that are very unusual, the present gild does not even so much as invoke the patronage of any saint.

In another case, of a gild at Grantham in Lincolnshire, it is ordained that, on the day of the gild-feast, each couple, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"videlicet sponsus et sponsa,"</FOREIGN> and each unmarried man, shall feed one poor person.  It is added that, on the same day, there shall be given to the friars minors of the town who have gone in procession with them, fourteen loaves, eight gallons of ale, and half a kid or sheep.</NOTE1></P><P>On the death of a brother, xij. lights shall be kept burning round the body, until buried, and offerings shall be made.

If he has been sick, the claim of the gild must be the first to be satisfied.  And if he dies intestate, his goods shall be held bound to the gild, to pay what is owing to it, and shall not be touched or sequestrated until full payment has been made to the gild.</P><P>Should it happen (which God forbid) that any brother is contumacious; or sets himself against the bretheren; or gainsays any of these ordinances; or, being summoned to a feast, will not come; or does not obey the Elder Father when he ought, nor show him due respect; or does not abide by what has been ordained by the Elder Father and greater part of the gild;—he shall pay a pound of wax and half a mark.  Moreover, he shall be put under suspension, denunciation, and excommunication, without any contradiction, cavil, or appeal.</P><P>Any one proved to be in debt, or a wrong-doer, shall be deemed excommunicate, and shall not presume to come to the meetings of the bretheren; and his company shall be shunned by all, so that no brother shall dare to talk with him, unless to chide him, until he has fully satisfied the Elder Father and the bretheren, as well touching any penalty as touching the debt or wrong-doing.</P><P>To keep and faithfully perform these constitutions, all the bretheren have bound themselves by touch of relics.</P><P>[Copies follow of eight grants of land to the gild; the yearly value of each of which is stated.

But it must be remembered that this income is what comes from real estate, and that it does not include the moneys coming in from any other sources, such as bequests, fines, &amp;c.  Still, this gild seems to have made no provision, such as was usually made by other gilds, for regular payments by members or new-comers, and so its annual income would not be large.  Hence, no doubt, arose the necessity for it to join the Gild of the Merchants.

What I here translate "tankards" is <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"ciphos"</FOREIGN> in the original.  From the use of this word in many places, there is no doubt that it meant a great drinking vessel, and it is our guide to the meaning of the other words.  In Madox's <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Formulare Anglicanum</FOREIGN> (p. 432, &amp;c.), we find Ralph de Nevill, in 1424, bequeathing many costly drinking vessels.

In the ordinances of the Gild of St. Michael on the Hill (Lincoln) (after, p. 178), I find mention made of "four of the tankards (<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">ciphos</FOREIGN>) which are called 'fullas.'" Are "olla" and "fulla" the same thing? I translate "fullas" by the word "flagons."  Again, in the ordinances of a Grantham gild, I find <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"tres ciphos vocatos masers;"</FOREIGN> evidently costly things, for the price is put down as xl.<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">s.</FOREIGN>, while <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"tria cornua de quibus predicti fratres et sorores, die convivii sui, bibere solent,"</FOREIGN> are priced at xx.<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1>; and in another Grantham gild, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"una debilis mazera"</FOREIGN> is put down as worth vij.<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1>  A "maser" or "mazer" is supposed to be a cup of maple wood, richly mounted.

It is a sheet of vellum, two feet five inches long, and eighteen and a quarter inches wide; the Return itself filling a space of two feet long by thirteen and a half inches wide, with three lines in supplement.  It is impossible to look at it without the suggestion arising that it was not <HI1 REND="i">written</HI1>, but <HI1 REND="i">impressed with letter stamps</HI1>.  I have compared it with the facsimile of the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Codex Argenteus</FOREIGN> of the Gospels of Ulphilas, given in Dr. Bosworth's valuable edition of the Gothie and Anglo-Saxon, &amp;c. Gospels.  [The difference of date, both being earlier than the received date of printing, does not touch the matter.]  The size of the letters is much the same; but this Return assuredly seems much more like an impressed, and not written, document, than does the Codex Argenteus.  The objections named in Dr. Bosworth's preface (p. v.) are not, I think, sound.  Different stamps, cut (not cast) for the same letter, would be certain to differ somewhat; while it is very well known that, long after printing became common, contractions were used in print.  I have hundreds of proofs of this in my own library. </P><P>In this case, the impression of the letters is deep, insomuch that they can be felt, blindfold, with the finger.  The ink has not, as in other cases, eaten away the vellum, and made it transparent; but, nevertheless, where all trace of ink is gone, the letters remain clear, because stamped in the vellum.  It is curious that it was obviously intended to illuminate the first letter of every paragraph.  A large space is left for that letter, in every case.

Condition, good.  Latin.  This Gild of the Fullers, and the two that follow, are given here as examples of gilds which were neither wholly social gilds nor wholly craft-gilds.  They clearly did not consider themselves to come within the terms of the writ for Returns from craft-gilds (see before, p. 130).  The ordinances are not indeed such as the true craft-gilds usually made.  In each of the three cases, only two or three of the ordinances have anything to do with the members of the gild <HI1 REND="i">as craftsmen</HI1>. But those two or three are found in each.  These gilds are thus worth attention, as a sort of cross between the social gild and the craft-gild. Examples of the ordinances of true craft-gilds will be found under the heads of Worcester, Bristol, and Exeter: Reading must stand by itself.</NOTE1><P>The gild was founded on the Sunday before the feast of the apostles Philip and James, A.D. 1297, by all the bretheren and sisteren of the fullers in Lincoln.</P><P>A wax light shall be kept burning before the Holy Cross, on the days when they go in procession in honour of the holy cross.</P><EPB/><PB N="180"/><P>None of the craft shall work [i.e. full cloth by treading it with the feet] in the trough; and none shall work at the wooden bar with a woman, unless with the wife of a master or her handmaid.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS732">The original of this ordinance is, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Item providetur inter eos quod nullus eorum laboret in alveo.

Earlier than this, and even later in some places, the fulling was done by trampling the cloth with the feet.  It was called "cloth-walking."  A Worcester gild seems to have been hence called the Gild of "Weavers, <HI1 REND="i">Walkers</HI1>, and Clothiers."  The foregoing prohibition stops the workman from thus "cloth-walking" <HI1 REND="i">in</HI1> the trough.

It is remarkable that, while this ordinance, and two others below, assume that soul-pence will be paid by the bretheren, there is not (as is usual) any ordinance directly requiring anything to be thus paid towards masses for the dead. Did the copyist accidentally pass it over?  A former ordinance requires payments to be made towards buying bread for the poor; but these, however praiseworthy, were not offerings towards masses to be said for the soul.</NOTE1></P><P>When any brother or sister dies, the Dean shall put four wax lights round the body; and the Graceman shall offer a penny for a mass, and the Warden a halfpenny, out of the goods of the gild.</P><P>If any one is in arrear in the halfpence due for the soul, he shall pay half a pound of wax to the gild.</P><P>In witness whereof, and to have the greater proof thereof in time to come, the official seal of the Deanery of Christianity at Lincoln has, at the special request of the bretheren and sisteren of this gild, been put hereto.

At the outset they are spoken of as "ordinaunces, actes, and statutes, made, and of ancient tyme assigned and ordeyned, by the ffounders of the gylde,"—and as being "nowe renewed and affermed." The original ordinances were probably in Latin; and I have no doubt that what we here have, are the early translation of a lost original, with some later additions and alterations.</P><P>Two things are of special interest in these ordinances.  One of these is the speech of the Alderman to new-comers, with the oath of fealty that follows.  The latter carries the student of English history back to the twelfth century.  It belongs to the time, often so much distorted in what passes by the much abused name of "History," when men entered into mutual bonds together, neither of them thinking of sacrificing his own independence, but each aware that the bond was one for mutual help.  The spirit of this will best be shown by quoting the words of the elder Glanville; who, writing in the time of Henry II., says:—<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Mutua quidem debet esse dominii et homagii fidelitatis connexio; ita quod, quantum homo debet domino ex homagio, tantum illi debet dominus ex dominio, præter solam reverentiam."</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS745">Glanville, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">De Legibus</FOREIGN>, lib. ix. cap. 4.  Odd mistakes have been made, through some, even well informed, writers not being aware that there were two Glanvilles, both lawyers, and both of high authority.  The elder was Chief Justiciary in the time of Henry the Second.  The later prepared some most valuable and interesting Reports of Cases examined and adjudged on by the "Committee of Privileges and Elections" (H. of C.), of which he was Chairman, in 21 and 22 James I., as to the Common Law rights of Parliamentary franchise, &amp;c.  This work ought to be better known than it is.</NOTE1></P><P>The other thing which is of special, if indeed it is not of unique, interest in these ordinances, is contained in the last two of them; both of which order ringing, and the former of them the ringing of "peeles," in memory of the dead.  This does not mean, in either case, what is <EPB/><PB N="192"/>
known as the "Passing Bell."  I have not met with any such order or custom in the ordinances of any other gild of so early a date.  After the Reformation, peals of bells sometimes took the place of the obits and other services by which bretheren and benefactors were, in the older time, kept before the gild in hallowed memory.  Illustrations of commemoration by the ringing of "peals," will be found on a later page, in the ordinances of the gild of Ringers of Bristol.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS746">In the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Promptorium Parvulorum</FOREIGN>, we find "A-pele of belle ryngynge (a pele of bellis)."  See Mr. Way's edition, p. 13.</NOTE1></P><P>The former of the two parts of these ordinances thus specially named, I believe to be of very much older date than the A.D. 1494 of the preamble; while the clauses as to the "peeles," "the ringers," and "doo rynge for hym," seem to have been added not far from when, perhaps when, these ordinances, "of auntient tyme assigned and ordeyned," were "renewed and affermed" in that year.  Attention has been several times called to a state of things nearly like that here found, in ordinances recorded as in use by a gild at a given time.  For the study of the ordinances of the old gilds to be historically true, and really instructive, the fact must never be lost sight of, that all parts of them were not necessarily, and often can be shown not to have been, made at the same time, still less at the date found recorded on the MS. itself.  But they must have been of that date, <HI1 REND="i">or earlier.</HI1></P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.9.3" TYPE="editorial commentary"><HEAD>BULL-RUNNING IN STAMFORD.</HEAD><P><SUPPLIED>Among the Returns made from gilds in 1389, there are four from Stamford.  But the ordinances contained in all these are short, and of very much less interest than those of the Gild of St. Katherine.  A part of one of them is, however, worth putting on record.  In the Return made by the Gild of St. Martin, it is stated that, on the feast of St. Martin (11th November), this gild, by custom beyond reach of memory, has a bull; which bull is hunted [not <HI1 REND="i">baited</HI1>] by dogs, and then sold; whereupon the bretheren and sisteren sit down to feast.  Some light is thrown on this strange custom by what is said in Strutt's "Sports and Pastimes" (Book III. ch. 7, § xvii.), as to "Bull-running at Stamford."  This gild is not there named; but the day, and the description of the bull-running, seem to show that what was kept up in 1646 was the relic of what was stated, in 1389, to have been the custom of this gild from time beyond reach of memory.</SUPPLIED></P></DIV3></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:5.10" TYPE="city records"><EPB/><PB N="193"/><HEAD>IX. <LB/>LUDLOW.</HEAD><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.10.1" TYPE="gild records"><HEAD>GILD OF THE PALMERS.</HEAD><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS747">CCCVIII. 136, 137.  Condition, very bad.  Latin.</NOTE1><P>The names are given of twenty-seven men, described as Burgesses of Ludlow, who appear to have founded and endowed this gild.  It is then stated that a number of men and women, who seem to have since joined the gild, met in the church of St. Lawrence, on the morrow of Pentecost, A.D. 1284, and agreed that the gild should be called the "Gild of the Palmers."  It was also then ordered that three chaplains should celebrate three services; one for the living, another for the dead, and the third in honour of the Holy Cross.  It was afterwards (as a distinct thing) agreed that the following should be the ordinances of the gild:—<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS748">See the note to the last clause of this Return.</NOTE1></P><P>When it happens that any of the bretheren or sisteren of the gild shall have been brought to such want, through theft, fire, shipwreck, fall of a house, or any other mishap, that they have not enough to live on; then once, twice, and thrice, but not a fourth time, as much help shall be given to them, out of the goods of the gild, as the Rector and Stewards, having regard to the deserts of each, and to the means of the gild, shall order; so that whoever bears the name of this gild, shall be up-raised again, through the ordinances, goods, and help of his bretheren.</P><P>If it befall that any brother or sister be cast into prison within the kingdom of England, or that a man or his goods be in any <EPB/><PB N="194"/>
way unrightly seized (which God forbid), our Rector and Stewards shall, without delay, use every means in their power to get him and his goods freed.  This they shall do at his own cost, if he can bear the charge; but, if he has not enough, the common fund of the gild shall be taken in aid, so as to enable them faithfully and happily to do what ought to be done under this ordinance.</P><P>If any of our poorer bretheren or sisteren fall into grievous sickness, they shall be helped, both as to their bodily needs and other wants, out of the common fund of the gild, until their health is renewed as it was before.  But if any one becomes a leper, or blind, or maimed in limb, or smitten with any other incurable disorder (which God forbid), we wish that the goods of the gild shall be largely bestowed on him.</P><P>If any good girl of the gild, of marriageable age, cannot have the means found by her father, either to go into a religious house or to marry, whichever she wishes to do; friendly and right help shall be given her, out of our means and our common chest, towards enabling her to do whichever of the two she wishes.</P><P>Services for the dead shall be duly attended by all the bretheren and sisteren.</P><P>If any man wishes, as is common, to keep night-watches with the dead, this will be allowed, on the condition that he neither calls up ghosts, nor makes any mockeries of the body or its good name, nor does any other scandal of the kind; lest, by such scandals, the discipline of the church may be brought into contempt, and the great judge may be provoked to heavier vengeance, who ought rather, by reason of the sins of the people, to be asked for love and mercy.  And never shall any woman, unless of the household of the dead, keep such a night-watch.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS749">The beginning of this ordinance will hardly be thought true unless the original is given.  This is as follows:—<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Si vero masculus quisquam voluerit, ut est moris, ejusdem defuncti vel defuncte nocturnis vigiliis interesse, hoc fieri permittatur, dumtamen nec monstra larvarum inducere, nec corporis vel fame sue ludibria, nec ludos alios inhonestos, presumat aliqualiter attemptare."</FOREIGN>  These remarkable words imply two things; <HI1 REND="i">first</HI1>, that ghosts and other sprites can be called up after death; <HI1 REND="i">second</HI1>, that this may be hindered by the strength of human law,—which this gild-ordinance, in so far, of course has.  Those familiar with our Old Northern literature, will be well aware how often the forms of the dead were believed to be seen on earth again.  And there is an instance, in the old Sagas, where not only did shade after shade revisit the pale glimpses of the moon, to the long and fearful disquiet of a neighbourhood, but where their often-comings could only be stopped by formal process at law; by the use of which they were, however, at last driven away.  The strange tale of what once befel at Froda in Iceland, will be found in the <FOREIGN>Eyrbyggia-Saga</FOREIGN>, cap. 53 56 (ed. Havnia, 1787, pp. 270-280).  [Sir Walter Scott gave an abstract of this Saga at the end of Weber and Jamieson's <HI1 REND="i">Illustrations of Northern Antiquities</HI1> (1814).]  The date of that Saga is not more than about twenty years (1264) earlier than that of this Ordinance (1284).

The Letters Patent of 3 Edward III. show that this was so, for they speak of the gild as existing <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"ab antiquo."</FOREIGN>  The opening clause of this Return itself shows that the gild was one that had then already much increased; for, after naming the founders, it is added:—<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Vocatis, ad hoc, viris et mulieribus qui de jure fuerant evocandi."</FOREIGN>  The gild probably was only called by a saint's name before 1284, as the order was then made that it should be called the "Gild of the Palmers."</NOTE1> the Lord Edward, lately king of England, grandfather of the now king, confirmed by his letters patent.</P><P>Then follow copies of (1) Letters Patent, dated at Kenylworth, November 17, 3 E.

It will therefore be interesting to add here the statement made, as to this old Gild of the Palmers of Ludlow, by the Commissioners who were appointed A.D. 1546, to report upon the gilds and other then existing bodies whose property was about to be given up to plunder, in order to satisfy the rapacious cravings of hungry Court parasites.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS750">The particulars of this iniquitous affair will be found stated in the Introduction.</NOTE1>  All these reports were of course made as unfavourable as possible to the gilds, so as to gloss over, as well as could be done, the iniquity of the whole affair; but it will be seen that this Gild of the Palmers had, among other things, established a school, with (for that time) a well-salaried schoolmaster.

And it is a remarkable illustration of the success which (not-withstanding several phrases of moralists) high-handed and unscrupulous force so often has in killing out even the traditions of freedom and free institutions, that the historian of the city of Worcester does not seem to have been so much as aware of the existence, in that ancient and famous city, of any old gild whatever.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS756">In Green's History of Worcester, a list is given of certain "Mysteries, Crafts, Trades, and Companies, incorporated at Worcester;" but all of them are modern, as compared with the sense in which the early English gilds are treated of in this book.  It is, however, certain that there were several old craft-gilds in that city.  See article xxij. of the Ordinances of Worcester, in Part III. of this volume.</NOTE1>  That such gilds existed there, as elsewhere, cannot be doubted: and a few years ago the original matrix of a seal was found, which throws some light upon the subject.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS757">I am indebted to the Town Clerk of Worcester for an impressiontaken from this seal.

In shape it is oval, pointed at the two ends of the longest diameter.  It bears, as its main charge, the figure of what must be taken to be St. Nicholas, bearing a pastoral staff, under a canopy of Gothic architecture.  Below is a kneeling figure.  Around the seal is the following legend:—<FIGURE></FIGURE>that is, "The seal of the Gild of Saint Nicholas, Worcester."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS758">A wood-cut of this seal will be found on p 207.  It is curious that, while there is the proper contraction mark over the "u" in <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"sigillum,"</FOREIGN>there is no contraction mark where it ought to be in any of the other words: only a general one at the end of the second, third, and fifth. The second word, which is the contracted form for <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"comune,"</FOREIGN> must be read here as a noun, and not as an adjective.  In the Latin ordinances, the word <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"comuna"</FOREIGN> is often used for "gild."</NOTE1>In the absence of any return from such a gild among what were sent up in A.D. 1389, and in the absence of any mention of such a gild by the historian of Worcester, I have searched the original records of the reports made, in the times of Henry VIII. and Edward VI., by the King's Commissioners; and the interesting facts contained in the two separate extracts that follow, are the result.

And the fact that, so many years after the foundation of Henry VIII.'s school, the gild school was so largely attended, is the best proof how untrue was the statement that the latter was "no schole of any purpos."  But the teaching of the youth of Worcester was of course a matter of too small importance to be allowed to interfere with the designs of those needy men who were bent on seizing the property of the gilds to their own uses.  And, though delayed for a short time, the plunder of this gild seems to have been entire.

III., to find a priest to sing mass perpetually for the soul of the founder Richard, and all christian souls; as by the same license, shewed before the commissioners, may appear; and was so used.  The said Gyld or Brotherhood was established and confirmed by King Henry IV., 1404, to the laud of God and honour of the Holy Trinity, in the church or chapel of the Trinity there, by his letters patent; having authority by the same to stablish a certain perpetual chantry of three priests or chaplains, to sing mass perpetually for the said king; as by a copy of the said letters patent, shewed before the commissioners, may appear.  The said service, founded partly by the bequeaste of several <EPB/><PB N="207"/>
persons, partly purchased by devout persons for and towards the sustentation of one priest, not only to say mass within the said chapel, but also to help the parson and curate in time of need in the parish church, because it doth abound of houseling people.  The priest is removable.  The value of the revenues, according to the book of First Fruits and Tenths, is £11. 3. 7 per annum.  The yearly value, according to the present survey, £10. 2; out of which are deductions. This chantry, with divers houses and lands, both within the city of Worcester and without, belonging thereto, came to the king's hands by act of parliament tempore Edward VI.; which was granted by his majesty, 5 July 2 Edw. VI., to Sir Edward Warriner, knt., and Richard Catplin, gent., who in like sort granted the same, 24 Novemb. 2 Edw. VI., to John Keyme and Richard Keyme.</P><P>"Both these grants passing after through several hands, the Trinity Hall, with most of the lands and houses appertaining thereto, came to Robert Yowle, Thomas Wylde, John Rowland alias Steyner, Hugh Ashley, William Langley, and William Welbin.  Mr Robert Yowle, as worthy and charitable a citizen as his time produced, surviving some of these feofees, gave, as far as in him lay, the Trinity Hall to the Weavers, Walkers, and Clothiers of the City of Worcester. Mr. John Rowland alias Steyner, married the daughter and heir of Mr. Robert Yowle; who, outliving his father-in-law Mr. Yowle, and all the other feoffees, Mr. Robert Rowland alias Steyner, his heir by Mr. Yowle's daughter, and true heir of their bounty and hospitality and other good deeds, 17 Sept. 9 Jacob R. gave, to the corporation of Weavers, Walkers, and Clothiers of Worcester, the Trinity Hall which his grandfather Mr. Towle before intended, and to his power then performed."</P><P><FIGURE></FIGURE></P></BODY><EPB/></TEXT></Q1></DIV4></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.11.2" TYPE="gild records"><EPB/><PB N="208"/><HEAD>(<HI1 REND="i">b</HI1>) GILD OF THE JOINERS AND CARPENTERS.</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>[In the possession of the Corporation of Worcester are two volumes, containing the "Orders and Bylawes made and ordeyned" by this gild, or company.

Mr. Thomas Fisher, very early in the present century, had full opportunities given him, of which he carefully availed himself, to examine the Records of this Gild; and he distinctly informs us that he examined documents which "carried back its history to the reign of Edward the First."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="n6">"Gentleman's Magazine," New Series, vol. iii. (1835), p. 162; and see <HI1 REND="i">ib.</HI1> p. 375.</NOTE1>  But he gives no hint whatever of having found any traces of the existence of the documents that now follow.  Mr. Halliwell, in his "Descriptive Calendar of the Ancient MSS. and Records in possession of the Corporation of Stratford upon-Avon,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS770">Printed (only seventy-five copies) in 1863, in a very large folio volume containing 467 pages.

I have searched the volume in vain for any copies or any description of either the Ordinances or Reports.</NOTE1> has gone over the same ground as Mr.  Fisher went over nearly sixty years earlier. But neither does he appear to have found any trace of the documents now printed.  I deem myself happy in being able to <EPB/><PB N="212"/>give, in this volume, documents which will not only be interesting to every one who looks on the birth-place and home of Shakspeare as a sort of National Shrine, but which also have a high intrinsic value of their own.</P><P>As anything touching the birth-place and home of Shakspeare arouses more than a common attention in the mind of every<EPB/><PB N="213"/>educated man of the English-speaking race, I depart, in this instance, from the course followed in all other cases, and print the Latin original side by side with my translation; and need now only add, that this original is of very high antiquity, and is expressed with a terse brevity not often found in ordinances of later date.]</P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.12.1.2" TYPE="gild record"><EPB/><PB N="212"/><HEAD>(1.)

TRANSLATION OF THE ORIGINAL RETURN.</HEAD><DIV5 NODE="EGilds:5.12.1.3.1" TYPE="ordinances"><P>Nicholas Samer and Walter Golde, Wardens of the Gild of the Holy Cross of Stratford in the county of Warwick, in fulfilment of a proclamation made at Warwick under a writ of our lord the King, do now make known to your royal excellency, with all loyalty and respect, the manner and form and source of the foundation of the gild, and all such matters and things touching the gild as are set forth in that writ; all which is set down in this writing, which was made on the last day but one of the month of January, in the twelfth year of your reign:—That is to say; as to the source of the foundation and beginning and continuation of this gild, the gild has lasted, and its beginning was, from time whereunto the memory of man reacheth not.  And there are, and always have been, two Wardens of the gild, who are bound to manage and gather in all the profits of the houses and rents belonging to the gild, rendering an account thereof every year to the bretheren and sisteren of the gild; and who ought to take care that the ordinances made by the bretheren and sisteren of the gild are faithfully kept in all things: and these Wardens must be chosen by the bretheren and sisteren of the gild, and remain in office for such time as the bretheren and sisteren think fit.  The ordinances themselves are written below.  The bretheren and sisteren of the gild have, and their forerunners have had from time whereunto the memory of man reacheth not, many houses and rents belonging as of right to the said gild; which are particularly set forth in the charter of confirmation lately granted to the bretheren and sisteren of the gild, and their <EPB/><PB N="215"/> successors, by the Lord Edward, King of England, forefather of the Lord the King that now is; a copy of which charter is given in the schedule stitched to this return.</P></DIV5><DIV5 NODE="EGilds:5.12.1.3.2" TYPE="ordinances"><HEAD>These are the ordinances of the bretheren and sisteren of the Gild of the Holy Cross of Stratford.</HEAD><P><HI1 REND="i">First:</HI1> each of the bretheren who wishes to remain in the gild, shall give fourpence a year, payable at four times in the year; namely, a penny on the feast of St Michael, a penny on the feast of St. Hillary, a penny at Easter, and a penny on the feast of St. John Baptist.  Out of which payments, there shall be made and kept up one wax; which shall be done in worshipful honor of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the blessed Virgin, and of the Holy Cross.  And the wax shall be kept alight every day throughout the year, at every mass in the church, before the blessed Cross; so that God and the blessed Virgin and the much-to-be-reverenced Cross, may keep and guard all the bretheren and sisteren of the gild from every ill.  And whoever of the bretheren or sisteren neglects to come at the above named times [when the payments are due], shall pay one penny.</P><P>It is also ordained by the bretheren and sisteren of the gild, that, when any of them dies, the wax before-named, together with eight smaller ones, shall be carried from the church to the house of him that is dead; and there they shall be kept alight before the body of the dead until it is carried to the church; and the waxes shall be carried and kept alight until the body is buried, and afterwards shall be set before the Cross.  Also, all the bretheren of the gild are bound to follow the body to church, and to pray for his soul until the body is buried.  And whoever does not fulfil this, shall pay one halfpenny.</P><P>It is also ordained by the bretheren and sisteren, that if any poor man in the town dies, or if any stranger has not means of his own out of which to pay for a light to be kept burning before his body, the bretheren and sisteren shall, for their souls' health, whosoever he may be, find four waxes, and one sheet, and a hearse-cloth to lay over the coffin until the body is buried.</P><EPB/><PB N="217"/><P>It is further ordained by the bretheren and sisteren, that each of them shall give twopence a year, at a meeting which shall be held once a year; namely, at a feast which shall be held in Easter week, in such manner that brotherly love shall be cherished among them, and evil-speaking be driven out; that peace shall always dwell among them, and true love be upheld. And every sister of the gild shall bring with her to this feast a great tankard; and all the tankards shall be filled with ale; and afterwards the ale shall be given to the poor.  So likewise shall the bretheren do; and their tankards shall, in like manner, be filled with ale, and this also shall be given to the poor.  But, before that ale shall be given to the poor, and before any brother or sister shall touch the feast in the hall where it is accustomed to be held, all the bretheren and sisteren there gathered together shall put up their prayers, that God and the blessed Virgin and the much-to-be-reverenced Cross, in whose honour they have come together, will keep them from all ills and sins.  And if any sister does not bring her tankard, as is above said, she shall pay a halfpenny.  Also, if any brother or sister shall, after the bell has sounded, quarrel, or stir up a quarrel, he shall pay a halfpenny.</P><P>It is also ordained, that no one shall remain in this gild unless he is a man of good behaviour.</P><P>It is moreover ordained, that when one of the bretheren dies, the officers shall summon a third part of the bretheren; who shall watch near the body, and pray for his soul, through the night.  Whoever, having been summoned, neglects to do this, shall pay a halfpenny.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS774">Compare this ordinance with the very curious one near the end of the ordinances of the Gild of Palmers of Ludlow (before, p. 194).  It will be observed that in this case, as in that, the night-watching is to be done by bretheren only, not sisteren.  But here the night-watching is <HI1 REND="i">imperative</HI1>; in the case of Ludlow it is only <HI1 REND="i">allowed</HI1>, and under strict conditions.</NOTE1></P><P>It is ordained by the Common Council of the whole gild, that two of the bretheren shall be Aldermen; and six other bretheren shall be chosen, who shall manage all the affairs of the gild with the Aldermen; and whoever of them is absent on <EPB/><PB N="219"/> any day agreed among themselves for a meeting, shall pay fourpence.</P><P>If any brother or sister brings with him a guest, without leave of the steward, he shall pay a halfpenny.  Also, if any stranger, or servant, or youth, comes in, without the knowledge of the officers, he shall pay a halfpenny.  Also, if any brother or sister is bold enough to take the seat of another, he shall pay a halfpenny.</P><P>Also, if it happens that any brother or sister has been robbed, or has fallen into poverty, then, so long as he bears himself well and rightly towards the bretheren and sisteren of the gild, they shall find him in food and clothing and what else he needs.</P></DIV5></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.12.1.4" TYPE="editorial commentary"><HEAD TYPE="supplied">Editorial Comment</HEAD><P>[Stitched to this Return is a copy of letters patent, issued on the 12th November, in the fifth year of (as it seems) King Edward III., in which are enumerated a long list of grants made to the gild, by many people, of lands, houses, and rents; all which gifts it is declared that the King, "so far as in him lies," confirms to the bretheren and sisteren of the gild, and to their successors.  These letters patent contain neither any license in mortmain, nor any "pardon" because of the lands, houses, and rents having been granted to the gild without such license in mortmain.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS775">See an instance of such "pardon" in the second part of my "Memorials of Old Birmingham" (Men and Names), p. 27.  In the same work will be found several illustrations of the practice, common in old times, of granting certain "rents," i. e. rent charges, without granting the freehold. Hence the terms used in the foregoing ordinances.</NOTE1>  One or the other of these two would have been necessary, had the grants been made to the gild after the passing of the Statute of Mortmain.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS776">See before, p. 195, note.</NOTE1>  It follows, that all the possessions here enumerated, and they are very many, belonged to the gild earlier than the year 1279.  What these letters patent did was, to protect the gild against any claim that might be set up, in the name of the Crown, as to any of the lands, houses, or rent-charges named therein.  It was simply a precautionary measure.]</P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.12.1.5" TYPE="editorial commentary"><HEAD>NOTE.—</HEAD><P>The foregoing ordinances, while bearing every mark of great antiquity, were not, as is clear from internal evidence, drawn up at one time, but were from time to time amended and added to, as has been already seen to have been done in the case of many other gilds. Thus it is said, in the Preamble of the Return, that there are two "Wardens" of the Gild; while, near the end, there is an ordinance as to two "Aldermen" and six help-men.  Again, in the last ordinance but one, a "steward" (<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">senescallus</FOREIGN>), nowhere else named, is found; and, in two other ordinances, "hostiarii" are named, which I translate, on account of the vagueness of the term, by the general word "officers."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS777">See a similar case of variance of titles in the case of Chesterfield, before, p. 165, note.  And as to "help-men," see the Hull Gilds, before, pp. 156, 160, 162.</NOTE1></P><P>Mr. Thomas Fisher, after stating that the ancient records of the gild which he had been allowed to inspect and transcribe "carried back its history to the reign of Edward the First," adds:—"at which time there appeared to have been a Gild of Holy Cross, a separate fraternity of our Lady, and another of St. John Baptist; <HI1 REND="i">which three distinct societies were afterwards incorporated into one gild.</HI1>"  But he does not give us any information as to when this incorporation took place. The foregoing ordinances show that it had not taken place in the year 1389, when those ordinances were returned as what were at that time in use.  But it appears to have taken place before the year 1442; for Mr. Fisher found, and in 1835 printed in the "Gentleman's Magazine,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS778">See the references on p. 211, note.</NOTE1>"the constitucyons and ordinaunceys for the good gouernaunce and rewle of the Gilde of the Holy Cros, oure Lady, and Seynt <EPB/><PB N="220"/> John the Baptist, of Stratford-uppon-Auene, made and ordeynyd the Monday next after the fest of the translacion of Seynt Thomas the Martir, the yere reyne of Kynge Harry, the Sixte after the Conquest, the xxj<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1>."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS779">These are reprinted in Mr. Halliwell's volume, cited above.</NOTE1>  These constitutions and ordinances are entirely different from those printed above; more diffuse, made much more to serve the interests of priests, and having nothing answering to the picturesque passages that are found above, about the sisteren and the bretheren coming to the Gild-hall with their tankards, filling these with ale, and, after prayers said, giving the ale to the poor.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS780">It is particularly worthy of notice that the older ordinances, though enjoining every care for the decency of burials, and enjoining prayers (<HI1 REND="i">by the bretheren and sisteren themselves</HI1>) before feasts, say nothing whatever about any priests, and make no provision for them.  A large part of the ordinances of 1442 is, on the contrary, devoted to provisions for the support, board, lodging, and services of priests.  Compare the Chesterfield Gilds, before, pp. 165, note, 168, note.</NOTE1>  Neither do the ordinances of 1442 contain anything about the "night-watches," nor about the help to be given to those overtaken by the misfortune of robbery or poverty.</P><P>In a clause near the end of the ordinances of 1442, things there named are to be done "by the goode minde, wyll, and assent of the said Master and all his Aldremen, <HI1 REND="i">accordyng as hit is of old tyme ordeynyd:</HI1>" but the ordinances of 1442 contain not the slightest hint, except in this very indirect way, at the ordinances now printed.  It seems most strange that, as the ordinances of 1442 were put into shape not longer than fifty-three years—that is, within a life-time—after the making of the return containing the ordinances now printed, and which were then, and must have been for some time after, the ordinances in actual force, no trace of the latter should be found among what Mr. Nichols describes as the "Records of high antiquity, which belonged to the Bretheren of the Gild, and were preserved among the muniments of their successors, the Mayor and Corporation of Stratford, in a chest in the Gild Hall;" and which reached, Mr. Nichols tells us, "from before the reign of Henry the Third to that of Henry the Eighth."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS781">Preface to a volume of plates of old "Paintings in Fresco, discovered in 1804, on the walls of the Chapel of the Trinity, belonging to the Gild of the Holy Cross at Stratford-upon-Avon," by Thomas Fisher.

ELENE, AND THE FINDING OF THE HOLY ROOD.</HEAD><P>Two hundred and thirty-three years after Christ's birth, and six after Constantine became Cæsar of Rome, the Huns came down in mighty force against the Romans.  Constantine was affrighted; but, in a dream, the likeness of the holy-rood was shown to him, by one who told him that, with this for a beacon, he should overcome his foes. Then he had a rood-tree made, and borne as his standard before the Roman host; and the foe was smitten down.  Constantine asked his wise men what this rood-tree meant; but they could not tell him. Some however, who had been baptized, told him the gospel story, and the meaning of the Cross.  Thereupon he was himself baptized; and he besought his mother, Elene, to go into Jewry, and seek for the true holy-rood.</P><P>She went forth with many followers; and at length reached Jerusalem. She called together the Elders of the Hebrews, and spoke to them reproachfully.  They did not understand what she meant, till one Judas told them that he was sure she wanted to find the holy-rood; 
<EPB/><PB N="225"/>
but he charged them not to let her know where it was hidden.  Thereupon, the elders refused to tell anything to Elene; and she, filled with holy wrath, threatened to burn them all up with fire.  In this fearful straight, they gave up Judas to her.  She besought him to tell what he knew.  He would not; so she had him bound, and cast into a dry pit, and left him there to starve.</P><P>When Judas had borne this Christian kindness for seven days, his courage was worn out, and he said that he would tell the truth.  Then he was released; and he led the way to the hill of the Crucifixion.  He prayed for a mark by which he might be sure of the exact spot where the holy-rood lay; and straightway there rose up a smoke from the earth.  Gladly did Judas then dig; and, after digging twenty feet deep, he found three crosses.  The three were taken to Elene; but she wished to know which of the three crosses was the true holy-rood itself.  Judas did not know; and all waited for a sign from heaven, to make known the truth.  This was at length vouchsafed, by the raising up to life of a young man who was being carried out for burial; and who, after being touched in vain by the crosses of the two thieves, was at last touched by the holy-rood itself.</P><P>And now the Hell-devil grew mighty wrathful, and made a long speech, which is fully reported; but Judas answered him in a long speech, which is also fully reported.  Then Constantine bade Elene to have a church built on the hill-side where the holy-rood had been found.  And Judas was christened, and made bishop of Jerusalem, by the name of Cyriacus.</P><P>But Elene wished, furthermore, that the nails used in the crucifixion should be found; and these, as the holy-rood itself had been, were made known by a fiery token arising from the earth, in answer to the new bishop's prayer.

This charter, dated 20th May, 14 Ed. III. (A.D. 1340), is set forth at full length.  It recites that an inquiry had been held, under the Writ <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">ad quod damnum</FOREIGN>;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS789">The meaning and purpose of this Writ will be more fully seen under Birmingham (after, p. 240).</NOTE1> and that it had been found, by the jury, that no harm would befal Coventry, or any one, if a Gild Merchant were founded there, with bretheren and sisteren, and a Master, and the usual powers of a gild, including that of making ordinances.  The charter goes on to declare that King Edward, "so far as in us lies," enables the men of Coventry to establish their Gild Merchant, and to make ordinances as they list.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="n11">As the gild could have been founded without any charter, there can be little doubt that this charter was got in the hope of smoothening the way towards the licenses of mortmain which were needed to enable the gild to hold lands; and which licenses would be more likely to be given when the gild was thus formally acknowledged.  There seems, indeed, to have been some obstacle in the way of this gild as to getting these licenses; for this Return shows that, forty-eight years after the gild had been founded, the licenses were not yet got.  Probably the hitch arose through some of the middle lords; the license of every middle lord being quite as essential as the license of the Crown.  The way in which these licenses are spoken of near the end of this Return, seems to point to these middle lords as giving trouble on this matter.  See after, p. 231.</NOTE1>  The inscription round the Great Seal having shortly afterwards been changed, the charter of 20th May 
<EPB/><PB N="227"/>
was, two months later (20th July), confirmed by an <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">inspeximus</FOREIGN>charter, under the new Great Seal.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS790"><P>The curious facts here stated as to the Great Seal are instructive.  Superficial writers on English history often point to the frequent confirmations of Magna Charta, as showing that it was not much heeded.  The facts are exactly the reverse.  The Great Seal has always been held to carry unimpeachable authenticity.  But every Great Seal bears the style of the reigning king.  Parliament insisted on one king after another reaffirming the Great Charter, under oath and the Great Seal, in order that it might not be pretended that the obligations contained in it were <HI1 REND="i">personal</HI1>only to any one king.  The same idea is well illustrated, though in another shape, in the present case.  The letters patent (or "charter") of 20th May were sealed with the Great Seal then in use.  But, another Great Seal having come into use soon after, the Gild Merchant of Coventry took the wise precaution to have the same identical letters patent exemplified under the new Great Seal, so as to stop all quibble.  This was a <HI1 REND="i">new</HI1> Great Seal under the <HI1 REND="i">same</HI1> king (not the only change of the sort in Ed. III.'s time), and not the Great Seal of a new king.  But the principle is the same, and it is only brought out the more strongly by such an illustration.</P><P>These changes in the Great Seal of Ed. III. give rise to some puzzling questions.  We learn from the Close Rolls (14 Ed. III. p. 1, m. 33, d̄), under date of 21st February, that it was, on that day, made known to all the Sheriffs in England, that Ed. III. had taken the style of King of France, and that a new Great Seal would be therefore made, and would be thenceforth used; all which would be explained to the Parliament that was to meet on Wednesday next after Mid-lent Sunday (29th March, 1340).  The same Close Roll, a little further on (m. 35, d̄), tells us that, on the 1st March following, the King gave into the hands of the Master of the Rolls a Great Seal then newly made [<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">de novo fabricatum</FOREIGN>] for use in England, and which he had brought with him from abroad; the Master of the Rolls at the same time giving up to the King the Great Seal that had been used while the King was in parts beyond sea.  It is added, that the Master of the Rolls, on the same 1st March, opened the purse in which the new Great Seal was kept, and put it to use.  [<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Eodem die aperiri, et brevia inde consignari, fecit.</FOREIGN>]  This 1st March would, however, be four weeks earlier than the time when the promised explanation would be given to Parliament; and possibly the Parliament might demur to the new seal.  The Rolls of Parliament show that much jealousy was felt at the King's having taken the style of King of France; for it was formally declared, in this very Parliament, and admitted under the Great Seal, that the Lords and Commons of England owed no allegiance to the King as King of France, but only as King of England.  What then was the Great Seal actually in use in the May following?  The Coventry Charter of 20th July expressly says that the Charter of 20th May was sealed with "the seal which we <HI1 REND="i">then</HI1> used in England" [<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">sub sigillo quo tunc utebamur in Anglia</FOREIGN>]; and, after setting forth the words of the Charter of that date, adds, that this charter is (on 20th July) exemplified "under the seal which we now use in England," [<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">sub sigillo quo nunc utimur in Anglia</FOREIGN>].  It is therefore unquestionable that an authentic Great Seal was in use in England on 20th May, which was not the same as that which was in use on 20th July, though both were used in the name of King Ed. III.  The question is, was the general use of the new Great Seal, bearing the new style of Ed. III. as King of France, delayed until July, notwithstanding the writ sent round to the Sheriff on 21st February and the Close Roll of 1st March; or, was the seal used in July a <HI1 REND="i">special</HI1> Great Seal, used in the King's name, but, in the absence of the King, by the Duke of Cornwall (Edward the Black Prince)?  The Duke had been declared, by the same Parliament of 1340, Warden of the kingdom during the absence of Ed. III. in France.  Bearing in mind the facts, as to <HI1 REND="i">two</HI1> seals, stated in the Close Rolls of 1st March, the latter is perhaps the true explanation of this puzzle of dates and seals.  The Charter of May is tested by the King himself; that of July is tested by the Duke of Cornwall.  Still, there is a difficulty in accepting this explanation, inasmuch as the above Return expressly tells us that the reason for getting the second Charter was, that the inscription (<HI1 REND="i">i. e.</HI1> the style of the King) round the seal had been changed:—<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">"Quele chartre feust apres renouellez par mesme laiel, par cause que lescripture de soun seal feust chaunger."</FOREIGN></P></NOTE1>

It has already been seen that there was a Gild Merchant in Beverley, which seems to have included the whole of the townsmen.  In Winchester and in Worcester, as will be seen from documents printed in Part III. of this volume, there were Gilds Merchant, which seem also to have included the whole of the townsmen. In Coventry there was a Gild Merchant, the Return from which seems to assume that it was intended to be a general gild of the citizens, although, in point of fact, there were several other gilds in that city.  In the case of Berwick-upon-Tweed, it will be found that a number of "Particular Gilds" were merged into one "General Gild" for all the town.  But in none of these cases are we able to know the circumstances under which the gild was first brought into being; nor can we find whether it was (as has been heretofore alleged), a matter of course, and not merely an incident, that a gild which embraced a whole town should be called a "Gild-Merchant."  In the case of the Gild of the Holy Cross of Birmingham, we are able to trace every step of its beginning, and to see that, while its establishment was the deliberate work of the whole town, and that it was thoroughly carried out for the good of the whole town, it was yet not a "Gild-Merchant."</P><P>The records from which the story of the foundation of this gild is learned, illustrate in a striking manner the true and practical constitutional principles which, long ages ago, found their home in England: of which the fundamental basis was, that, in a sound political society, the men who make it up <EPB/><PB N="240"/>must be trusted; and that the men of every neighbourhood must best understand their own affairs, and ought to be held bound to fulfil their duties to their neighbours.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS807">In our days, instead of the responsibility being felt by the men of every neighbourhood to fulfil all that the welfare of the neighbourhood requires, <HI1 REND="i">doctrinairism</HI1> has superseded the constitutional life of the people by an array of costly "Commissioners" and "Inspectors," who assume to dictate to men everywhere what they are to do.  Hence, the most modest statement of the simple but sound principles that form the basis of the English constitution, bewilders many.  No greater misfortune can overtake a State than when, as now in England, the noblest branches of knowledge and study, and those most vital to a free people,—namely, the knowledge and the study of the Institutional Life and of the Constitutional History of the State,—are neither taught nor cared for in schools, colleges, or universities. The material for this knowledge and study is richer in England than anywhere else in the world.  Some further illustrations of it will be found in Part III. of this volume, and in the Introduction.</NOTE1></P><P>I now give translations of the two records which show the beginning of this gild.  The first of these states some earlier facts, while setting on foot, by the Writ called the "Writ <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">ad quod damnum</FOREIGN>," an inquiry, on the spot, by men of the neighbourhood. The second gives such authority as the very limited power of the Crown enabled it to give, for the endowment of the gild; and which proposed endowment it was that made a license of mortmain necessary.]</P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.14.1.2" TYPE="document"><HEAD>(1) WRIT FOR INQUIRY, TO BE MADE BY A JURY ON THE SPOT, TOUCHING THE PROPOSED FOUNDING OF THE GILD.</HEAD><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS808">Translated from the original, which is in the Public Record Office; but it is, oddly enough, there put among the <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Inquisitiones post mortem.</FOREIGN></NOTE1><P>Richard, by the grace of God, King of England and France and Lord of Ireland, to our well beloved Thomas Raleghe, our Escheater in the County of Warwick, Greeting.

<EPB/><PB N="241"/>
the church of St. Martin of Bermyngeham, to the honour of God, the blessed Mary his Mother, the Holy Cross, St. Thomas the Martyr, and St. Katherine; to be held by the said Chaplains and their successors for ever; as in our letters patent aforesaid is more fully set forth.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS809">The reason why the letters patent of 6 Richard II. never took effect, is not hard to find.  Wyclif and Piers the Ploughman were then abroad in the land, in the immediate neighbourhood of Birmingham.  A chapel had been built in Deritend (see after, p. 258), in which it is very remarkable that no provision was made for any chantry, or for any services for the dead. The original letters patent of 6 Richard II. contained the clause, always inserted in such cases, that the license could not be availed of until the scheme had been approved after full and open inquiry made by the men of the neighbourhood.  This seems to have been found hopeless, so long as the endowment was intended to be limited to formal church services.  It redounds much to the honour of the endowers, that they consented to merge their original scheme in the larger work of a gild of the whole town.</NOTE1>  And now the Bailiffs and Commonalty of Bermyngeham have prayed us that, instead of those letters patent, which have never, they say, taken effect, we will, for us and our heirs, grant license that they may make and found, in honour of the Holy Cross, a Gild and lasting brotherhood of bretheren and sisteren among themselves in the said town, to which shall belong as well the men and women of the said town of Bermyngeham as men and women of other towns and of the neighbourhood who are well disposed towards them: And that they may make and ordain a Master and Wardens of the said Gild and brotherhood, who shall have rule and governance over the same: And that they may make and found there a chantry, with chaplains to celebrate divine service in the church of St. Martin of Bermyngeham: And that they may do and find there other works of charity, for our welfare and that of the Queen, and for the bretheren and sisteren of the said Gild and brotherhood, and for all good-doers to them, and for their souls' sake and those of all Christians, according as the ordering and will of the said Bailiffs and Commonalty shall appoint in that behalf: And moreover, that we will, for us and our heirs, grant license to the said John Colleshulle, John Goldsmythe, and William atte Slowe, that they may give  <EPB/><PB N="242"/>
and assign, to the said Master and Wardens, eighteen messuages, three tofts, six acres of land, and forty shillings of rents, with the appurtenances, in Bermyngeham and Egebaston, to have and to hold to the said Master and Wardens, and their successors, Masters and Wardens of the said Gild and brotherhood, to enable them to find two chaplains to celebrate divine service in the church aforesaid, and to find other works of charity for ever, according to the ordering and will aforesaid; such lands, tenements, and rents, not to be any that are held of us in chief. Now we wish to know whether or not we can fulfil this prayer without harm or danger to us or to others; and, if it be to the harm or danger of us or others, to what harm and what danger, and to whose harm or danger, and how and whence; and further, of whom the said messuages, tofts, lands, and rents, are held, and by what service, and what kind and manner of service; and how much the said messuages, tofts, and lands, are yearly worth, according to the true value of the same; and who and how many are the middle lords of those messuages, &amp;c., between us and the aforesaid John Coleshulle, John Goldsmythe, and William atte Slowe; and what lands and tenements will remain to the said John Colleshulle, John Goldsmythe, and William atte Slowe, after the proposed gift; and where and of whom these are held, and by what service, and what kind and manner of service, and how much they are yearly worth: And whether the lands and tenements remaining to the said John, John, and William, after the proposed gift, will be enough to fulfil the customs and services which are bound to be rendered, as well in respect of the messuages, tofts, lands, and rents proposed to be given, as in respect of the other lands and tenements which will be kept by the givers; and also to meet all other burdens which it belongs to the holders thereof to bear, —such as suits, views of frank-pledge, aids, tallages, watches, fines, redemptions, amerciaments, contributions, and all other charges whatsoever incident thereto: And whether the aforesaid John, John, and William will still be liable to be put on assizes, juries, and all other recognisances whatsoever, the <EPB/><PB N="243"/>same as their ancestors have heretofore been: —So that, through the proposed gift, and in default of the givers, the neighbourhood may not become charged or burdened more than has been wont.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS810">The original words of this most significant clause are,—<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Ita quod patria, per donacionem et assignacionem predictas, in ipsorum Johannis, Johannis, et Willelmi defectum, magis solito non oneretur seu gravetur."</FOREIGN>Every owner of land holds it, under the English constitution, subject to several obligations; and he cannot be allowed to be sentimentally generous, if the so doing will throw more obligations on his neighbours. <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Patria,"</FOREIGN> in such cases as this, must be translated as "neighbourhood."</NOTE1>  We therefore command you that, upon the oath of good and law-worth men of your bailiwick, by whom the truth of the matter may be able to be the better known, you do forthwith make Inquisition<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS811">The word "inquisition" here means, not only the fact of an inquiry clearly and openly made, but the further fact of putting the result of this inquiry into writing.</NOTE1> touching all that is aforesaid; and that, without delay, you do send the same, clearly and openly taken, into our Chancery, with the seals put thereto of yourself and of those by whom it shall be made: and therewith send this writ.

</P><EPB/><PB N="250"/><P>It is important to a thorough understanding of the position of true <HI1 REND="i">Town Gilds</HI1>, such as was the Gild of the Holy Cross of Birmingham, to have it remembered that their action was, in every sense, identified with the whole town.  In many cities and towns in England (including the City of London), the "Gild Hall" and the "Town Hall" are still one and the same thing. It was so in Birmingham before the iniquitous plunder of the gilds which took place in the time of Edward VI.  The formal description of the building, in many documents in the Public Record Office, is, <FOREIGN>"le Towne Hall, alias dict' le Guilde Hall."</FOREIGN> But this fact, and all the "works of charity" done by the gild, availed nothing to stay the ruthless rapacity of hungry courtiers. A remarkable, and, so far as I know, a unique instance of survival, notwithstanding this rapacity, is found in the fact that a body which was called into existence to do the same sort of "works of charity" as were done by this gild, escaped the hand of the spoiler at this time, through (as it seems) the saving of the life-interest of the founder's wife; and it has come down to our own times, still doing, in Birmingham, the "works of charity" which the old Gild of the Holy Cross was accustomed to do more than four hundred years ago, "according to the ordering and will of the Bailiffs and Commonalty" of the town. The curious facts as to the thus happily saved relic of the old gilds of England, will be found next following.]</P><P><FIGURE></FIGURE></P></DIV4></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.14.2" TYPE="gild records"><EPB/><PB N="251"/><HEAD>(b) GILD COMMONLY CALLED "LENCHE'S TRUST."</HEAD><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.14.2.1" TYPE="editorial commentary"><HEAD TYPE="supplied">Editorial Commentary</HEAD><P>[This Gild is a direct off-shoot of the Gild of the Holy Cross. An endowment was put into the hands of feoffees, who were, after the death of the founder's wife, to do the same sorts of "works of charity" as the Gild of the Holy Cross was established to do, "according as the ordering and will of the Bailiffs and Commonalty shall appoint."  Had this endowment been merged in the gild, it would have been lost to the town.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS826">No doubt the feoffees of William Lenche carefully avoided using the name of "Gild," after the legislative plunder which had befallen the bodies so called.  But for this, the "Trust" would assuredly have soon been called a "Gild."  There is, in the British Museum, among the Harleian MSS., a curious instance of a body of feoffees formed, as far as can be made out from wills and ordinances, under circumstances very much like those of Lenche's Trust.  But these feoffees having unfortunately been in too great a hurry to call themselves a "gild," they fell, with the others, on the hapless day of the massacre of the gilds and the plunder of their property.  This case happened in Bury St. Edmund's.</NOTE1></P><P>Many instances have already been given of the foundation, as well as the endowment, of gilds by one or more persons.  In several cases it has been seen that, though the property was used towards the purposes of the gild, it remained still in the hands of persons generally called "feoffees," and was subject, in fact, to their disposition; and that, sometimes, no license of mortmain was, through whatever cause, obtained for many years, perhaps never.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS827">Two marked instances of this will be found in the cases of the Gild of SS. Fabian and Sebastian, Aldersgate, London (before, pp. 12, 13), and of the Gild Merchant of Coventry (before, pp. 226 note, 231).  In each case the independence of the feoffees is expressly admitted on the face of the Return.  Numerous other illustrations of the same thing could be given.  In such cases, if no license of mortmain was got, as well from the Crown as from all the middle lords, before the year 1547, the feoffees may, by skilful tact, have saved their trust from the general plunder.  But I do not know of any other case in which this happened than that of "Lenche's Trust."</NOTE1>  The present is another case, though happily a more lasting one, of this kind.</P><P>One William Lenche, living in Birmingham at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries, and the owner of lands there and in the neighbourhood, wished, being 
<EPB/><PB N="252"/>
childless, to follow the example of the first endowers of the Gild of the Holy Cross.  But he wished, at the same time, to assure to his wife, while she lived, the income from his estate.  So, instead of getting licenses in mortmain to enable him to vest his lands in the Gild of the Holy Cross, he made a deed of feoffment, vesting them in persons therein named; but requiring these feoffees to pay the income to his wife while she lived, and afterwards to apply it to identically the same "works of charity" as it has been seen that the Gild of the Holy Cross charged itself with fulfilling.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS828">That this was so, is made certain by the deed of re-feoffment of 1540; which expressed, in terms, the precise intentions of the endower, after the wife's death.  (See after, pp. 255, 256.)</NOTE1></P><P>The original deed of feoffment still exists, together with the declaration by William Lenche of his intentions.  In 1628, an Inquisition was made under the Statute of 43 Elizabeth, cap. 4. This inquisition was made on the spot, by a jury of the indwellers of Birmingham, to learn what had been done in the matter of Lenche's endowment.  The inquisition was duly made and recorded, in the same manner as the inquisition had been made and recorded before the founding of the Gild of the Holy Cross itself.  A Decree followed upon that inquisition, which reaffirmed the purposes of the original endowment.  From these documents and records, the purposes and ordinances of this relic of the old English gilds become plainly learned.]</P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.14.2.2" TYPE="document"><HEAD>(1) DECLARATION OF THE INTENT OF THE FEOFFMENT OF LENCHE'S LANDS.</HEAD><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS829">From the original in the possession of Mr. Charles Best, as Solicitor to "Lenche's Trust."

The master of the Gild of the Holy Cross was, at the same time, named one of the feoffees.

A separate gild existed in the hamlet of Deritend.  This is proved by a long series of charters, forming part of muniments of title in my own possession.  Not only is this gild continually named in these, but it is named on account of houses that belonged to it.  There was also founded in Deritend, in 1375, a chapel, which was liberally endowed by the inhabitants; but as to which it is remarkable that, neither in the agreement made as to services therein, nor in the declaration of the purposes of endowment contained in 
<EPB/><PB N="259"/>
the License of Mortmain, is there any provision whatever made for any chantry, or for any services for the souls of the dead. So entirely unprincipled, however, were the proceedings that were taken to grasp as much as it was possible to bring within that scheme of legislative plunder under which the English gilds were annihilated in the time of Edward VI., that the property of the old gild of Deritend, and that of the chapel endowment, were mixed up together, and were both described as belonging to a "chauntry," though no chantry ever existed in the place!  To illustrate these facts, necessary to a true knowledge of the story of English gilds, but which would otherwise be deemed incredible, I now quote some of what is said, in the Certificates of Colleges, about the pretended chantry of Deritend, but which really mixes up together the endowment of the gild and of the chapel.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS837">It is interesting to catch unprincipled people tripping.  Though the Commissioners and their followers were careful to speak only of a "chauntry" of Deritend, yet in one document, still in the Public Record Office, I find an interlineation of the words "sive Gilda."  Thus the truth got blurted out upon the face of the record, in a moment of inadvertence or of conscience-smiting. The facts as to the Gild of St. John the Baptist of Deritend will be found stated in the first part of my "Memorials of Old Birmingham," (published in 1863); while facsimiles and translations of the Agreement and License of Mortmain touching Deritend Chapel are given in the second part of the same work ("Men and Names:" published in 1864).

The above ordinance, which had the strongly expressed sanction of the Ecclesiastical Court and lawyers, as well as that of the bishop, is a striking practical illustration, almost in the same words, of what was shown by me, in 1857, to be the true law of England on this subject.</NOTE1></P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.15.1.6" TYPE="section"><HEAD><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">De quatuor tractatibus in anno.</FOREIGN></HEAD><P>All the bretheren, being summoned, shall come together before the Alderman, Stewards, and Dean, four times a-year; namely, on "Hokeday," the Nativity of St. John Baptist, Michaelmas, and Christmas, or within eight days next following, to consider and do whatever the welfare of the Gild needs; and every brother shall pay, on each of those days, or within eight days afterwards, sixpence to the Gild-stock.

The decree is dated 1st February, 1385.  This gild was not, however, like the Gild of Holy Trinity, favoured with the bishop's personal approval, nor with any grant of Indulgences.

Yet Oxford had an ancient "Gild Merchant," although the Return sent up from it in 1389 is lost.  A curious Return, unhappily in very bad condition, is still extant among the others, which gives copies of many very old charters as to Burford, in Oxfordshire.  In this Return, the customs of the Gild-Merchant of Oxford are again and again put forth as the great exemplar for Burford, just as those of York are put forth as the exemplar for Beverley.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS866">See before, pp. 151 153.</NOTE1></P><P>This contrast between the gilds of Cambridge and Oxford is made the more striking by the fact, that a copy has been sent to me of a MS. of gild ordinances found in the Bodleian Library, and naturally supposed therefore to be the ordinances of an Oxford gild.  So soon as I read it, I was satisfied that its true home was nearer East Anglia. This opinion has been wholly confirmed by copies of three sets of gild ordinances which I have since received from Cambridge.  One of these is taken from a MS. in the Library of Trinity College: the other two are taken from the Baker MSS. in the University Library.  The particulars of the gilds of which these are the ordinances, will be found next following.  They put it beyond even the possibility of doubt that the MS. in the Bodleian Library does not contain the ordinances of an Oxford gild, but that, however strange it may seem, it contains those of a Cambridge gild.

Not less striking is the entire change in this respect which took place in the fifteenth century. Nowhere else in all England have I yet found one gild after another copying the ordinances of an older gild.  In the fifteenth century this happened in Cambridge; and with such seemingly blind helplessness, that ordinances, professing to be those of distinct gilds, and which had more than forty years' difference between them in the dates of their foundation, are more 
<EPB/><PB N="273"/>
identical in shape and words, so far as these could be used by separate bodies, than are the different versions of what are avowedly copies of the same Bye-laws of Tettenhall-regis.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS867">See the last article in Part III. of this volume.</NOTE1></P><P>In the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, are the ordinances of the Gild of St. Clement, made in the year 1431. Among the MS. collections, now in the University Library, made by that industrious Cambridge antiquary, Thomas Baker, is a copy of the ordinances of the Gild of Saints Peter and Paul of Cambridge, bearing the date of 1448.  In the Bodleian Library at Oxford are the ordinances of the Gild of All Saints, with no place named, but bearing the date of 1473.  Among the before-named MS. collections of Thomas Baker, there is a copy of the same ordinances; and, though it is not so stated, either this copy must have been made from the MS. now in the Bodleian, or both were made from the same original; for the same loss of one ordinance is found and noted in each.  Copies of all these three sets of ordinances have reached me from the three different libraries wherein all have long rested in peace. The presumption was, that, though all in English, they would be found, as in the case of other gilds, different from each other. On comparing them critically, however, I found that, with only altered names and dates, and a few small details, they are all in the same words.  And all must have been taken from the same original, inasmuch as any addition to or alteration from the earliest of them is seen on the face of the later MSS.  I now give the ordinances of the oldest of these three gilds.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS868">From the Gale MSS. (O. 7, 15), Trinity College Library.  This must be the original set of the ordinances used by the gild, for the later entries are made in different hands.  (See after, p. 281.)  It is made up bookwise, as in the instance before, p. 262, and the other examples there named.</NOTE1>  The variations found in the later ordinances are shown, some in the margin and others in foot-notes.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS869"><P>Mere differences of spelling, not showing any dialectic change, are not noticed, nor are the occasional but obvious errors of the scribe.</P><P>For the copy of the ordinances of 1431 I am indebted to the kindness, indeed to the hand, of Mr. Aldis Wright, Librarian of Trinity College, Cambridge. The ordinances of 1473 were found, in consequence of searches made for the purpose of this work, by Mr. Coxe, Librarian of the Bodleian. Mr. Dalton, of Cambridge, has been good enough to make the extract from the Baker MSS.  To all these gentlemen my cordial acknowledgments, and those of the Early English Text Society, are due.  The fact of the identity of the ordinances is, in itself, a discovery that is highly instructive, and which could not have been made without my having had all the copies thus furnished.  The different MSS. are distinguished in the margin and notes of what now follows, by the letters "B," "C (1)," and "C (2)." "B" means the ordinances of 1448; "C (1)" means the Bodleian MS. of the ordinances of 1473; "C (2)" means the Baker MS. copy of the same. When reference is made to "B and C," it means that C (1) and C (2) are both of them like B.  I may add, that the fidelity of the copies found in the Baker MSS. is strikingly shown by the comparison of "C (1)" and "C (2)."  It may be useful to searchers to know that a list of the many volumes of the Baker MSS., which are partly in the British Museum and partly in the University Library, Cambridge, will be found in the second edition of the "Biographia Britannica," vol. i. pp. 521-525.</P></NOTE1></P><EPB/><PB N="274"/><P>Each set of ordinances is prefaced by some Latin quotations, and by a prayer for the bretheren and sisteren.

(Secularia, p. 102.)  What Mr. Lucas thus found in 1862, I have found in 1868.  But I wish to be just in fixing the blame. It is not the <HI1 REND="i">Officers</HI1>, but the <HI1 REND="i">Corporation</HI1> itself, that must be held up to reprobation.  The officers would not be narrow-minded if they did not know the narrow-mindedness of those whom they serve.  Happily, Bristol stands alone in this respect.  From English cities of oldest renown—Winchester, Worcester, Exeter, Coventry—I have met with the most courteous, cordial, and generous help, in my endeavour—with a labour of love not light—to put forth, in this volume, a picture of the spirit of self-help that lived in our middle-age England.  And the librarians of Oxford and Cambridge have, with equal courtesy, opened their stores, as well as private manorial owners, and the living representatives of ancient feoffees. Nothing is more pleasant than the acknowledgment of such courtesy.  It was reserved for Bristol, alone, among the Bodies and Persons to whom I have applied, to fill in the artistic touch which contrast gives.  The Corporation of Bristol has yet to learn that historical documents are the inheritance of the nation, and are not to be hugged as the private possession of a few persons who, happening to be in power, take the Dog in the Manger as their exemplar of conduct.  In this case, the conduct of Bristol becomes supremely ridiculous, because it is as practically futile as it is historically criminal.  So soon as this work was announced, Mr. Charles Innes Pocock, a gentleman personally unknown to me, was good enough to offer to place at my disposal a folio volume of MS. extracts from the old records of Bristol.  I gladly accepted his offer, and simply wished to collate what I found in this volume with the originals. Every obstruction has been thrown in my way.  The volume thus sent to me by Mr. Pocock is, however, written in so unusually clear a hand that the reader, indebted as he is to Mr. Pocock's courtesy, will lose nothing but the possible mistake of a letter here and there, the exactness of which I am unable to test through the narrow-mindedness of the Corporation of Bristol, which will, when too late, be repented of.</NOTE1><P>John Barstaple, Mayor of the town of Bristol, and the Commonalty of the same town, to all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting in the Lord.  Know ye, that We, with the assent of the whole Council of the aforesaid town, have seen certain ordinances, made in the present year, ordained by the Masters and good men of the craft of fullers of the same town, <EPB/><PB N="284"/>
and sealed with the seal of the mayoralty of the aforesaid town, as appears by their petition hereafter following, and which is enrolled on the red paper of the Court of Gihald<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS940">(<HI1 REND="i">sic</HI1>.)</NOTE1>, as a record for ever, in these words:—</P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>To the honourable and discreet sirs, the Mayor, sheriff, and all the other honourable burgesses of the Common Council of the same town, humbly pray the Masters of the craft of Fullers of the said town: Whereas the said craft has, of old time, had divers ordinances enrolled before you of record in the Gihald of Bristol, in order to put out and do away with all kinds of bad work and deceits which divers people, not knowing the craft, from time to time do, as well in fulling cloths as in "pleityng" and "rekkyng," and many other defects in the said cloths; by which defects the town and craft are fallen into bad repute in many places where the said cloths are put to sale, to the great reproach and hindrance of the said craft.  Wherefore, may it please your very wise discretions and honourable wisdom, to grant to the said suppliants that all their good ordinances of old time entered of record, and not repealed, be firmly held and kept and duly put in execution; and that four good men of the said craft be chosen by them every year, and sworn before the Mayor loyally to present all manner of defects which hereafter shall be found touching the said craft, with power, twice a week, to oversee such defects, and likewise to keep watch over the servants and workmen of the same craft, within the franchise of Bristol, so that the said servants and workmen should not take more wages than of old time is accustomed and ordained.  And <EPB/><PB N="285"/>
besides, discreet sirs, may it please you to grant to the said suppliants the new additions and points below-written, to the profit and amendment of the said craft, and to the honour of the said town.</P><P>First, it is ordained and agreed that, each year, four men of the craft shall be chosen as Masters, to search every house of the said craft, twice a-week, and oversee all defects in the said cloths, if any such there be; and to present them before you at the court; so that whosoever does such bad work shall pay for the same the full price of the cloth: one half to go to the town, and the other half to the craft, without any pardon or release: and this, over and above all reasonable amends made to the buyer of the cloths.</P><P>Also, the Masters of the craft shall not give more to the men of the said craft than fourpence a-day, beginning from the first Monday in Lent till the feast of St. Michael then next ensuing; and, from the said feast of St. Michael till the same Monday in Lent, threepence a-day.  And if any of the masters pays more to the workmen than is above ordained, he shall be fined, each time, ij.<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1>; that is to say, xij.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> to the commonalty, and xij.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>to the craft.  And if the men take more from the masters, they shall pay, each time, xij.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>; that is to say, vj.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> to the commonalty, and vj.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> to the craft.  And if the men are rebels or contrarious, and will not work, then the four masters shall have power to take them before the Mayor and Court of Gihald of the town, to be there dealt with according to law and reason. And moreover, the said servants shall work and rest in their craft, as well by night as by day, all the year, as has of old time been accustomed.</P><P>Also, whereas certain merchants of Bristol have been used aforetime to have some of their cloths fulled in divers parts of the country round about; which merchants, after the said cloths are thus fulled, seeing well that they cannot be set to sale by reason of their defects, without great amendment and work by the Fullers of Bristol; it is ordained and agreed that henceforth no man of the craft shall full or amend any manner of cloth which <EPB/><PB N="286"/>has been thus fulled out of the town, under penalty of vj.<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> viij.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>; that is to say, xl.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> to the commonalty, and xl.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> to the craft. Saving always that the masters will always be ready to amend cloths which shall be bought between merchant and merchant.</P><P>Also, it is ordained and agreed that, if the said four Masters do not well and loyally fulfil their office and duty as before said, they shall pay six shillings and eight pence sterling, to be paid to the bailiffs of the town of Bristol, to the use and profit of the commonalty of the said town, without any pardon or gainsaying.</P><P>Which ordinances we affirm, ratify, and confirm, for ever; saving always to us, the Mayor and the Council of the town, that if any ordinance, point, or addition, touching the said craft, may be profitable, as well to the town as to the craft, then, by the advise of us and the masters of the said craft, amendment thereof shall be made, these ordinances notwithstanding.  In witness whereof, at the special prayer of the said Masters, to guard and maintain their ordinances aforesaid, we have set to these presents the seal of the Mayoralty of the town of Bristol. Done in the Gihald of Bristol, the 14th day of February, in the 7th year of the reign of King Henry, the fourth since the Conquest.</P></Q1><P>And we, approving these ordinances, do hereby, for us and our successors, as much as in us lies, confirm them.  In witness whereof, at the special request of the said masters and good men of the craft aforesaid, we have hereto put our common seal. Given in the Gihald of Bristol, on the Monday next after the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the seventh year of the reign of King Henry, the fourth after the Conquest.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS941">The first and last paragraphs of the original are in Latin, while the Petition of the Fullers, and their ordinances, are in old Norman French.

In consideration whereof, there was a commission sent from Walter, bishop of Worcester, unto Robert Harell, rector of Dirham and Deane of Bristow, dated the 18th day of the kalends of June, anno 1318, to warne all persons that had any charters, writings, or privilidges, or mynuments, concerning the liberties or privilidges of the church of All Saincts and fraternities of the Kalenders, to bring them in, and also to enquire the truth of the same, in respect that most of the charters, writings, and recordes were lost and embezeled away, by reason of fire that happened in the place or library that was in the said church of All Sainctes.  To the execution of which commission were called and cyted the Abbott and Covent of St. Augustine of Bristow, and divers burgisses in the name of the Mayor and Cominaltie of the same towne, and also all Rectors and Vickers of the same deanery, who appeared some in person and others by theire procurators.  These certified the said bishop that, in times past, the said fraternitie was called the Guild or brotherhood of the cominaltie, cleargy, and people of Bristow, and that the place of the congregation of the brethren and sisters of the same was used in the church of the Holy Trinitie of Bristow, in the time of Aylworde Meane and Bristericke his sonne, who were Lordes of Bristow before the last conquest of England.  The beginning of which fraternitie did then exceed the memory of man; and did continue successively, after the conquest, the place of meeting of the said fraternitie, <EPB/><PB N="288"/>during the time of William the Conqueror, William Rufus, and King Henry the first, and also of Robert Fitzhaymon, Consull of Gloucester and Lorde of Bristowe, and subsequently in the time of King Steeven, who tooke this towne by warre from Robert earle of Gloucester, that was founder of the priory of St. James.  And after decease of the said Steeven, and reigne of King Henry the second, who was sonne of Maud the empresse and daughter to King Henry the first, one Robert Fitzharding, a burgis of Bristow, by consent of the said Henry the second and Robert earle of Gloucester, and others that were interessed therein, the said Guild or brotherhood, from the said church of Holy Trinitie unto the church of All Sainctes did translate and bring; and did found a schoole for Jewes and other strangers, to be brought up and instructed in Christianitie under the said fraternitie, and protection of the Mayor of Bristow and monastery of St. Augustine in Bristoll for the time being; which house or schoole is now called the Checker Hall in Wine Street.</P><P>Note here, that the place of Justice called the Tolsey of Bristoll and counsaile house of the same, was builded in the third yeare of king Edward VI., and in the yeare of our Lord 1549; which was many yeares after all these matters above written were mentioned.  And the place wherein the said kalenders and library were burned, is the roode loft or chamber next unto the streat, being on the north side of All Sainctes church, over the pictured tombe of queene Elizabeth.</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.16.3" TYPE="gild records"><HEAD>(c) GILD OF THE RINGERS.</HEAD><P>It is agreed and determined, that every one that is or shall be of the Company or Society of Saint Stephen's Ringers, shall keep all Articles and Decrees that are or shall be specified in this Ordinary concerning the good government and peaceable society of the said Company; and that none shall be of the said Society but those that shall be of honest, peaceable, and good conversation, and such that shall be at all time and times ready to defend whatsoever shall be alledged against the said Company, as well <EPB/><PB N="289"/>in regard of any challenge as of any other wrong or injury that shall be offered and done by any one, of what estate or condition soever he be; so that we may not only stop the mouths of those that would or shall exasperate themselves against us, but also gain credit and reputation by our Musical exercise; that others of our rich neighbours, hearing these loud Cymbals with their ears, may, by the sweet harmony thereof, be enlarged in their hearts to pull one string to make it more sweet.

In Mr. Pocock's MS. volume, a number of dates are given, as those of copies made one after the other, and through which this copy has come lineally down.  The earliest of the copies thus named is of the year 1620.  The internal evidence carries the true date of the original ordinances to a much earlier time, though each copy has, of course, adapted the spelling to its own time.  These ordinances bear every characteristic of those of gilds that can be identified as flourishing in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  Even the amount of the fines, as well as other internal marks, carry back the date to the same time. In the <HI1 REND="i">Bristol Mirror</HI1> of 7th December, 1822, there appeared an account of a meeting of this gild, with the addition of what professed to be some of the ordinances.  But the editor must have been made the victim of a hoax.  What were thus printed have some likeness to some of those now printed; but they are very incomplete and in-accurate, and are, moreover, disfigured by a fantastic spelling which the writer no doubt thought gave them an air of antiquity, but which, in fact, at once stamps them as spurious.  Probably some member of the gild who had seen the original ordinances, quoted those fragments of them from memory, and dressed them up in this fashion under the much mistaken notion that an indefinite multiplying of consonants and misplacing of vowels would make them pass for "early English."</P><P>Mr. Pocock's MS. gives many further particulars as to this gild, including the names of the Masters and Wardens up till A.D. 1834, and many fresh memoranda made and ordinances passed, from time to time, since 1620.  Of these, two may be quoted; the one of which shows that the gild admitted others than the usual class of mere Ringers; while the other shows that this gild, like all the old gilds of any importance, was accustomed to have its annual feast day, with the obligation on all the bretheren, save such as were specially excused, to be present at the feast.  They are as follows:—"Nov. 18, 1700.  Admitted Mr. James Hollidge, late sherriffe, who paid his fine, 3.<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> 8.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>; and David Kinlock, Rector of St Stephen Parish, who paid for his admittance 3.<HI1 REND="i">s.</HI1> 4.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1>, as allso 4.<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> to the Sextone.

Moriœ Encomium,</FOREIGN> ed. 1633, p. 115; the prefaratory letter to which work, addressed to Sir Thomas More, bears the date of A.D. 1508.</NOTE1>  The ordinances of several gilds given in this volume have shown how the bretheren and sisteren delighted to go in procession, "with much music"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS944">See, for examples, before, pp. 148, 149.</NOTE1> [<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">multa melodia</FOREIGN>].  But, besides this, there were gilds formed for the express purpose of practising music.  Warton gives an interesting account of one of these in his "History of English Poetry."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS945">Vol. ii. p. 536, ed. 1840.</NOTE1>  Bishop Percy mentions another in the Essay prefixed to the first volume of his "Reliques."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS946">Ed. 1812, p. xlv.</NOTE1> Among the Returns made in January, 1389, there is one from the "Gild of the Minstrels and Players" of Lincoln.  It has already been seen, in the ordinances of the Gild of St. Katherine of Stamford, how that most charming of all the forms of melody—the ringing of bells in peal—was established, at least as early as 1494, as one mark of honour to the memory of good-doers to the gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS947">See before, p. 190.</NOTE1>  This Bristol Gild of Ringers illustrates the same thing in a very striking manner.  Where older gilds appointed <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">placebo</FOREIGN> and <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">dirige</FOREIGN> to be said, with, sometimes, as in the case of Stamford, a peal of bells, this gild kept the anniversary of the death of good-doers by the ringing of a special peal.</P><P>The importance attached to church Bell-ringing, as a science, can be carried back, by the help of our English records, to an early date. In Stowe's "Survey of London" is the following passage:—"The same year [1244] the king [Henry III.] commanded the keepers of his works at Westminster, that they should provide for the Abbot of Westminster one strong and good beam, to support the Bells of the king's gift; and deliver the said beam to the sacristan.  And in the 39th of the said king, he gave 100 shillings, by payment each half

year, to the bretheren of the Guild at Westmmster, and their successors, who were assigned to ring the great Bells there, to be paid out of his Exchequer, till the king can provide them the value of 100 shillings Land or Rent."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS948">Stow's Survey, Book vi. p. 8, ed. 1720.</NOTE1></P><P>Several records are to be found in the Public Record Office as to these Westminster and other Bells.  One, of 34 Henry III., desires Edward Odson to make a bigger bell than those he had made the year before; and if he has not metal enough, he must buy it: He must not break up any of the old bells to get the metal: And the new Bell must be ready by the feast of Edward the Confessor.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS949">Close Rolls, 34 Hen. III. m. 8.</NOTE1>  Next year, Edward of Westminster (no doubt the same man who was, in the last year, called the son of Odo) is desired to make another Bell, to chime in harmony with the Great Bell of Westminster, though not so big.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS950">Close Rolls, 35 Hen.

Mangnam eciam crucem collocari faciat in Naui ecclesie Westm̃., et emat duos angelos, in modum Cherubyn, ex utraque parte illius crucis collocandos."</FOREIGN></NOTE1>  Within a month of the last date, the same Edward of Westminster is desired to buy two little Bells, and to deliver them to the Constable of the Tower of London, to be hung in the Chapel there.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS951">Close Rolls, 35 Hen. III. m. 16.</NOTE1>Four years later, letters patent, still extant in the Public Record Office, were issued (A.D. 1256), granting, to the Gild of Ringers of Westminster, the (for that time) large yearly payment of a hundred shillings out of the treasury, until rents to that amount were settled upon the Gild.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS952">The original words are:—<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Concessimus pro nobis et heredibus nostris, ffratribus de Gilda Westm̛. qui assignati sunt ad pulsand. magnas campanas,"</FOREIGN>&amp;c.  This is the grant mentioned by Stow, as quoted above.</NOTE1>  It is added, that these bretheren shall have all the liberties and free customs <HI1 REND="i">which they have had, from the time of the blessed Edward, King and Confessor, until now.</HI1><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS953"><P>The original words are:—<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Et quod fratres ipsi, et eorum successores inperpetuum, habeant omnes libertates et liberas consuetudines quas habuerunt a tempore beati Edwardi Regis et Confessoris usque ad tempus confectionis presencium."</FOREIGN>  Patent Rolls, 39 Hen.

Ellacombe, rector of Clyst St. George, Devonshire, has in the press, while this is being written, a work on Bell-Ringing; and, as he and I have exchanged communications on the subject, some of the same facts will probably appear there as here.  But Mr. Ellacombe's book will be a full and valuable account of a subject of great interest, at which I here only incidentally glance.</P></NOTE1>  The antiquity of the <EPB/><PB N="296"/>Gild of Westminster Ringers is thus put beyond the reach of doubt. And "Big Ben" of Westminster proves to be only the young offspring of a very ancient race.</P><P>Other examples might be given.  Thus, Birmingham has long been famous for its peals of bells.  The Gild of the Holy Cross paid "ffor keping the clocke and the chyme."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS954">See before, p. 248.</NOTE1>  In 1552, it was formally recorded that there were, in the old church of St. Martin's of Birmingham, "iiij Belles, with a clock and a chyme."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS955">See "Memorials of Old Birmingham" (second part, <HI1 REND="i">Men and Names</HI1>), p. 91.</NOTE1>  And a piece of land was, some centuries ago, given to "Lenche's Trust,"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS956">See before, p. 251.</NOTE1> which has ever since been called "Bell-rope-croft," and the purpose of which was, and still is, that the income shall "be employed and disposed of for buying of Bell-Ropes for the said Church, and keeping the same in order from time to time."</P></DIV4></DIV3></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:5.17" TYPE="city records"><EPB/><PB N="297"/><HEAD>XVI. <LB/>READING.</HEAD><HEAD TYPE="sub">THE GILD OF READING.</HEAD><DIV3 NODE="EGilds:5.17.1" TYPE="editorial commentary"><HEAD TYPE="supplied">Editorial Commentary</HEAD><P>[Among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum, is a Chartulary of Reading Abbey.

A literal translation would be unintelligible.  The case is historically valuable, as showing another source whence information as to the old English gilds may be got.  It has already been seen how the Archbishops of York, one after another, did what they could to help on the spirit of local self-reliance.  And it has been seen how the Bishop of Ely avowed his approval of ordinances that denounced, in the strongest terms, the intermeddling of the clergy in secular affairs.  It is well known that many others, not only of the higher ecclesiasties, but of the monastic writers of the chronicles of our history, were among the most earnest asserters of free English institutions.  But there were of course some who were overbearing, and who cared nothing for lawful right.

There is an apparent anomaly on the face of these records; inasmuch as, while a charter was granted to the gild in the sixth year of Edward IV., everything contained in this charter was repealed, by Act of Parliament, on petition of the Mayor and Corporation of Exeter, in the twenty-second year of the same reign: and yet we find the gild afterwards going on, and prospering, and exercising all the powers named in the charter, just the same as if no such Act had passed.  And, what seems even stranger, no trace can be found, on the records of the gild, either of the petition of the mayor, or of anything that befel the gild, or was done by the gild, in consequence of that petition and the enactment that followed it.</P><P>The only explanation seems to be that, a quarrel having arisen between the corporation and the gild, the former went to extremes; but that, after the prayer of their petition had (perhaps unexpectedly) been granted, the parties came to terms, settled their differences, and mutually agreed to treat the Act of Parliament as a nullity.  Certain it is, that the gild and the corporation thenceforth both flourished, side by side, and on the best mutual terms, just as if there had never been any quarrel or act of suppression, and that the authority of the gild was never practically questioned.  The charter of Edward IV. was, indeed, again and again recognised and confirmed by later <EPB/><PB N="300"/>kings; and fresh ordinances and bye-laws were again and again made by the gild in later times, and sanctioned by the judges in due form of law.</P><P>It will be most convenient to give here, <HI1 REND="i">first</HI1>, an outline of the original charter; <HI1 REND="i">second</HI1>, some particulars of the quarrel that arose between the Gild and the Corporation, and of the transactions that took place thereon, including the Petition of the Mayor and Corporation against the Gild, with the enactment founded thereon; and, afterwards, the Ordinances of the gild, with some illustrations of their practical working.

He replied that there were none.  But the Corporation of Exeter, wiser than many others, bethought themselves, thereupon, that it would be well to know what really was contained in their archives.  They were happy enough to engage the services of Mr. Stuart Moore, a gentleman not only of great experience in such matters, but who takes a lively and intelligent interest in them.  Under his skilfully applied wand it is that, knowing what I have been seeking, the discovery has been made of all the records here given as to this gild, except that which I had already found on the Rolls of Parliament.

Some tailors who were on the city council were even refused the usual gifts, of <EPB/><PB N="303"/>wine and canon bread, made at Christmas to the members of that body; while some men are found to have been of souls so mean that, to keep the city franchise, they "renunced the charto<HI1 REND="sup">r</HI1>purchased by the taylo<HI1 REND="sup">r</HI1>ys contrary to the liberties of the cite, and euery poynte of the same, and the use of h<HI1 REND="sup">t</HI1>, by ther oth made vppon the crucifyxe and the holy Euangelistes."<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS959">It must have been cases of this kind which roused the indignant action of the gild, of which an example will be found after, p. 323.</NOTE1>  But, on September 22, 17 E. IV. (that is, after the King's Award), we find that, "in opyn Court, the Mayer and baylleffes, by the assent of the xxiiijti, at instans and contemplacyon of owre soverayne lord the kyng, according to certyn instrucyons bynethe wretin,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS960">These are what are given on the next page, under the head of <HI1 REND="i">The King's Award.</HI1></NOTE1> toke, reputed, and declared the said persones nott discomened nor disfraunchesid for any matter or cause touchyng the variances bytwext the sayd Mayer, baileffes, and Communalte, on the tone party, and the Maister and Wardens of the craft of Taylours, yn the other party, passid before this tyme."</P><P>On the other hand, it seems that the Tailors' gild tried to carry their charter into active effect with a very high hand. Doubtless the facts were highly coloured by the corporation officers; but on the Rolls of the Mayor's Court of Exeter, during the 15th, 16th, and 17th years of E. IV., there are found many presentments, which set forth how divers of the gild have tried to enforce the payment, by tailors in the town, of their fees to the gild; and we are told, in the extraordinary Latin of the day, how, <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"modo guerrino arraiati, vi et armis, videlicet jackis, doblettis of defence, swerdis, bokelers, gleyves and stavys, in domo"</FOREIGN> of the offender they went, and beat and threatened certain men who held out.  Sometimes their weapons are described as <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"arcubus, glayvis, baculis, et daggariis,"</FOREIGN> or as <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"gladiis et daggariis;"</FOREIGN> but the object is always the same.  In one instance the offence is aggravated by one of the wrong-doers being further presented as playing dice and cards within the city.</P><P>All these things were going on during the 15th, 16th, and 17th years of E. IV.  Meantime, the corporation was sparing no expense to get up a case against the gild.  Entries are found <EPB/><PB N="304"/>
in the Receivers' Accounts, and elsewhere, of moneys paid, again and again, to those going to London <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"pro materia Cissorum;"</FOREIGN>for large expenses incurred in the same matter from time to time; for horse-hire in riding to Taunton to get some evidence, and getting it written out under the common seal of Taunton; and for taking that evidence up to London, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P><P>At length the matter was brought before the king in council; and the following is the curious record of the award made:—]</P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="EGilds:5.18.1.4" TYPE="document"><HEAD>(3) THE KING'S AWARD.</HEAD><DIV5 NODE="EGilds:5.18.1.4.1" TYPE="prologue"><P>Memorand̄: that, concerning this corporacion, greate trobles grewe betweene the Mayer and Comminalte of thone partie, and the company of the saide Taylors of thother partie;  Thone supposinge the new graunted Charter to be prejudiciall, and agaynst the lyberties of the Citie, and thother parte, beinge men of good welthe and countenance, and sundrie of theyme then of the common counsell of the Citie, standinge upon theire reputation, and myndynge not to take the foyle, stande to meaneteane and defende theyre cause.

Having urged upon Mr. Moore (see before, p. 300, <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>) that there must be some traces among the records of the Corporation, giving fuller details as to the facts, and the costs, of the proceedings taken, he at length found several entries, in the old account books of the Receiver of Exeter, which throw much light upon the whole matter.</P><P>The following is the substance of some of these (the originals being in Latin):—</P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><P>14-15 Ed.

It differs somewhat in form from the usual underwritten Conditions to Bonds, which were even more common at that time than now. A Bond was then usually given, with the Charter of a grant of land, as an additional assurance to the title.  The Bond itself is not recorded in this case; but it, and this underwritten Condition, were plainly parts of a transaction in which John Hamelyn and Joan his wife had given to the Gild a close of land in Tadyford, in consideration that the Gild would take care that prayers were said for the souls of the givers,—trusting, as again we see, rather to the Gild than to an ecclesiastical corporation. Compare before, p. 143.  It is not the only instance of the kind recorded in these volumes of the Gild of Tailors of Exeter.  Instances of this kind are of great importance, as enabling us to know thoroughly the true character of the English Gilds.</NOTE1><P>To all trew Cristen men to whom this present writyng indented shall come, John, Pryor of the Priory of Seynt Nicholas in the citee of Exceter, and of the same place the Covent, sendith grettyng, in the savoure of all thingis.

There are bodies of "Bye-laws, Acts, and Ordinances," made so late as A.D. 1713 and 1716, bearing the signatures, in approval of them, of the Justices of Assize in those years. (See before, p. 210.) One of James the Second's unlucky Charters (17 October, 3 Jac. II.) was also granted to this Gild.  But, while it is well to mention these facts in proof of the vitality of the Gild, the giving copies of those later documents would be beyond the scope of this work.</P><P>The extracts, of an earlier date, which I have received from the records of Exeter touching this Gild, beyond what I have here printed, are numerous; but, highly interesting and instructive as the story of this Gild is, it would have unduly swelled the treatment of it here to have given fuller details.

IV.  These interesting Rolls exist from 48 Henry III., A.D. 1264, to the beginning of last century.  The present Ordinances show what a tight hand the Corporation of Exeter sought to keep upon the Gilds in that city.  They enable us, therefore, the better to understand the anger and long-continued feud against so independent a body as the Tailors' Gild. The Cordwainers' Gild was, from the first, content to put itself under the condescending patronage of the Corporation.  Izacke says that "the cordwainers and curriers were first incorporated by grant under the common seal of the city 21 R. II. (1387); which was confirmed 21 E. IV. (1481); and lastly 3 Marie, 1555."  (Antiquities of Exeter, ed. 1724, p. 62.)  The above extract is therefore the confirmation of 1481.</NOTE1><P>To all men that this presentez schall here or see, gretyng in oure lorde euerlastyng.

The Tailors' Gild never submitted to anything of the sort, but took up "swerdis and daggariis" rather, in maintenance of their independence.  See before, p. 303.

It by no means follows that it does not exist there; for neither the "Olde Vsages" of Winchester, nor the Gild Ordinances of Exeter, which are here printed from the originals (see before, p. 299, and after, p. 349), were known to exist in those old cities of renown, till I asked for search to be made in both places, my reasons being given for thinking they must exist there, together with the indications by which each might be known,—my wishes being, happily, in both cases cordially seconded by the corporate authorities of those ancient cities.  Having been informed by the town clerk of Berwick that these ordinances are not in the archives of his borough, and, moreover, that they never were there (which is of course a mistake), I have not thought it necessary to pursue the search, because (1) these ordinances are not in English, and so do not give us a sample of the local tongue then spoken in Berwick; and (2) they have already been twice printed, and one of these prints, though not following as closely as I could wish the Latin original (for no Latin was written and spelled in the thirteenth century as it is there given), is sufficiently reliable for the use made of it here.  This print will be found in Houard's "<FOREIGN LANG="FRE">Traités sur les coutumes Anglo-Normandes, publies en Angleterre, depuis le onzième jusqu'au quatorzième Siècle</FOREIGN>" (Rouen, 1776), vol. ii. pp. 467-487.  An imperfect copy of the ordinances, printed, moreover, with inexcusable carelessness, though avowedly taken from Houard, is given in Dr. Wilda's "<FOREIGN LANG="GER">Das Gildenwesen im mittelalter</FOREIGN>" (p. 376); and it is the only sample he gives of gild ordinances.  But, most strangely, he leaves out, from beginning to end, the titles of the ordinances.  These are always valuable, in every case where they are found, as giving the authentic substance of what, when set forth at length, is sometimes obscure.  I give these titles here, and a short summary of each ordinance.</NOTE1><P>Statutes of the Gild, ordained by the pleasure of the Burgesses: so that, where many Bodies are found side by side in one place, they may become one, and have one will, and, in the dealings of one toward another, have a strong and hearty love.</P><LIST><EPB/><PB N="339"/><ITEM><LABEL>(1) <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Una Generalis Gilda observari debet</FOREIGN>.</LABEL> All separate gilds, heretofore existing in the borough, shall be brought to an end.

The meaning of the word "cavil" clearly appears to be part or share.  See Halliwell's Archaic Dict.; and Spelman's Glossary, word "Lot," where a bye-law is quoted much like the Berwick one (20) above,—"<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">quod nullus burgensis rure manens habet lot neque cavil cum burgensibus inhabitantibus</FOREIGN>."  The phrase is thus equivalent to the modern "part nor lot" (see Acts viii. 21).</P><P>The use of this word may throw some light upon the true meaning of the discussed phrase "scot and lot," about which my Father had no doubt whatever.  The words of the oath given before, p. 189, "I shalbe redy at scott and lotte, and all my duties truly pay and doo," do but strengthen and confirm the interpretation given by him, and which was corroborated by the conviction that within this homely phrase was contained the essence of English independence.  The following was printed in "The Parish" (2nd ed. p. 474): "What follows from being one of the Body of a Parish is, the liability to two distinct things.… These two things are, <HI1 REND="i">bearing lot</HI1>and <HI1 REND="i">paying scot</HI1>.

The Offices [Parish offices] already named illustrate the former of these liabilities.  All Parish Rates (and not any one of these in particular) illustrate the latter."

Already much has been seen of this, in dealing with the Gilds of Beverley, Birmingham, Bristol, Berwick, Exeter, &amp;c.  In those cases, the Gilds were the stand-point.  In what follow, the Municipal Body is, in each case, the stand-point.  As a general rule, the result is found to be one of harmony, and not of antagonism, between the Municipal Bodies and the Gilds.</P><P>In the first three of the very interesting documents which follow, the Gilds are expressly named, and their connection with the Municipal Body is more or less clearly seen.  In the last, the Costomary of Tettenhall Regis, we have an important proof of how much of the spirit of the old Gilds lived on, notwithstanding the iniquitous plunder and subversion of them, under colour of an Act of Parliament, in the time of Edward VI. The tenants of the manor, who were a thoroughly self-governing Body, in shaping their bye-laws adopted many regulations of the same class as what are found in the more important of the old Gilds.  The document is one of very special and instructive interest to those who would understand the real basis of free institutions.</P><P>I have to thank the Mayor, Council, and Town Clerk of Winchester for their liberal courtesy in placing the highly-interesting and valuable Roll of their "old usages" in my hands for the purpose of this work.</P><P>In the same manner am I indebted to the Corporation and to the Town Clerk of Worcester, for entrusting me with the four original volumes of Records from which I have here made large extracts (see before, p. 200, note).</P><P>Not to the Corporation of Bristol do I or any reader of this volume owe any thanks.

With the "Usage" itself, and the one that follows, the statute 4 Ed. IV. c. 1 (A. D. 1464), as to the length and breadth of broad cloths, &amp;c., should be compared.  It was not passed till more, probably, than a century later than the time of these "Usages of Winchester;" but it shows that the necessity for some regulations, to prevent fraud, had then become general, and were not confined to Winchester.  It is a very remarkable statute.  It begins by reciting that,—</P><P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED">"Whereas many years past, and now at this day, the workmanship of cloth, and things requisite to the same, is and hath been of such fraud, deceit, and falsity, that the said cloths in other lands and countries be had in small reputation, to the great shame of this land; and by reason thereof a great quantity of cloths of other strange lands be brought into this realm, and there sold at an high and excessive price, evidently shewing the offence, default, and falsehood of the making of woollen cloths of this land; Our said lord the king, for the remedy of the premises, and to the preferment of such labours and occupations which have been used by the making of the said cloths, by the advice, assent, request, and authority aforesaid, hath ordained and established certain Statutes and Ordinances in manner and form ensuing."</Q1>  It is then enacted:—</P><P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED">"First, that every whole woollen cloth, called broad cloth, which shall be made and set to sale after the feast called <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">St. Peter ad vincula</FOREIGN>, which shall be in the year of our Lord M.CCCC.LXV., after the full watering, racking, straining, or tenturing of the same, ready to sale, shall hold and contain in length xxiv yards, and to every yard an inch, containing the breadth of a man's thumb, to be measured by the crest of the same cloth, and in breadth ij yards, or vij quarters at the least, within the lists; and if the said cloth be longer in measure than the said xxiv yards, and the inches, then the buyer thereof shall pay to the seller for as much as doth exceed such measure of xxiv yards, according to the rate of the measure above ordained.  And it is enacted and established by the authority aforesaid, That all manner of cloths called streits, to be made and put to sale after the same feast, after the full watering, racking, straining, or tenturing thereof, ready to sale, shall hold and contain in length xij yards and the inches, according to the measure aforesaid, and in breadth one yard within the lists.  Also it is ordained and established by the authority aforesaid, That every cloth called kersey, to be made and put to sale after the said feast, after the full watering, racking, straining, or tenturing of the same, ready to sale, shall hold and contain in length xviij yards and the inches as is aforesaid, and in breadth one yard and a nail, or at the least one yard, within the lists." </Q1></P><P>The Act goes on to ordain penalties against certain mixtures with the woollen cloth; that cloth shall be made of uniform workmanship, "without difference in the weaving, fulling, knotting, or burling;" and that every piece of cloth shall be sealed with a seal, showing, by its shape and make, what is the quality and quantity of the cloth (in fact, an assay-mark). Provision is then made for the appointment of Keepers of the cloth seals (who are called "Aulnegers"), their duties and rewards.  It is then recited that, "Whereas before this time, in the occupations of clothmaking, the labourers thereof have been driven to take a great part of their wages in pins, girdles, and other unprofitable wares, under such price as stretcheth not to the extent of their lawful wages, and also have delivered to them wools to be wrought by very excessive weight, which hath driven, and driveth men and women into discourage of such labour;" and it is enacted, under penalties, that clothmakers shall pay their "labourers, in any part of the said trade, <HI1 REND="i">lawful money</HI1> for all their lawful wages and payment of the same," and shall deliver wool to them according to the due weight.  On the other hand, the workmen, and especially the fullers, are enjoined to duly perform their duty in their occupations; likewise under penalties.  Provision is made for the hearing and disposal, by the local authorities of every place, of all complaints and cases arising under these two last clauses.  The whole statute is well worth careful study.  Probably it did not touch the sort of woollen goods named in the above "Usages," because those Usages, kept alive under the vigilant eye of the bailiffs of Winchester, had already been found strong enough to meet the case.  As to the means and the care formerly taken for the prevention of trade frauds, see further the General Note at the end of these Usages.</P></NOTE1> shal habbe tweye ellen and an halfe<EPB/><PB N="352"/>to-fore þe tapener in þe werke; þe chaloun of lengþe of fowre ellen and an halfe, shal habbe in worke þre ellen to-fore þe chaloun-makyere; þe chaloun of v. ellen, shal habbe in langenesse fowre ellen in þe werk to-fore þe chaloun-makyere.

But it is well known that an important "Gild of Merchants" existed in that city at the time.  In "Transcripts from the Municipal Archives of Winchester," by the late Town Clerk of that city, for a copy of which I am indebted to the courtesy of his son, the present Town Clerk, this "Gild of Merchants" is often mentioned, both early and late.  So late as 1705, Prince George of Denmark was made a freeman of Winchester and "one of the Gild of Merchants" of the city. The close connection between the Gilds and the Corporations has already been shewn in the Introduction to this volume.  It is not therefore strange that the arrangements for the great periodical sales, or fairs, such as the above "Usage" seems to deal with, should be found in a record of the Usages of this city.  In some places in England there were "hans-houses," which were probably used as the head-quarters of these great sales or fairs, just as very many parishes used to have a so-called "Church House" for public purposes.  It seems from the above "Usage," that, in Winchester, four houses were used for these great sales.  It is not clear whether they belonged to the Gild, or were hired for the time.  The statement that the serving-men "ought, in all times," to be in the four houses, perhaps means that the houses belonged to the Gild, and ought never to be left empty.</NOTE1></P><EPB/><PB N="358"/><P>Off Gates of þe towne of Wynchestre, whanne þe baylyues of þe town shulle nyme of hem þat beþ out of þe fraunchyse and custome, shulle is þus:—Þat euerych cart þ<HI1 REND="sup">t</HI1> bryngeþ corn to towne to selle, an halpeny of custome as many tyme as he comeþ, and þe horsecharche a ferthynge.</P><P>Also, euerych cart þ<HI1 REND="sup">t</HI1> bryngeþ yre oþer steel, twey pans; an horse-charche, a peny.</P><P>Also a cart þ<HI1 REND="sup">t</HI1> bringeþ newe sadeles, to carye, by strete oþer by lanes, corden oþer tray, shal of custome twey pans; an horsecharche a peny.</P><P>Also euerych cart þ<HI1 REND="sup">t</HI1> ledeþ mylle-stones, fowre pans.

In neither case, however, has any writing been destroyed, except that the initial letters of the nine lower lines are partially gone. One small word is destroyed in the first paragraph, a hole having been eaten in the Roll.</P><P>The original writing was in a strong and fair hand; but many parts have become so worn and faint, through time and use, that they have been by no means easy to decipher.  The heading is written in red ink; and the first letter of every paragraph is also put in a large capital red letter.  There are also rubrications, after full stops in the middle of several of the paragraphs.  A wavy red line is put between each of the first twenty paragraphs, and also between the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh paragraphs, but not elsewhere.  The Roll is written on both sides.</P><P>The greater part of the Roll is of general interest; and I have given a marginal abstract of all those parts.  But the latter nineteen clauses of the "Usages" touch upon technical matters of pleading, &amp;c.; and, <EPB/><PB N="364"/>though useful to the philologist, they can have no general interest. I have, therefore, only pointed out their subject.</P><P>I have added a few notes.  To do full justice to such an interesting document would alone require a volume.</P><P>[As to the exact date when these Usages were made, that cannot be now ascertained.  In the cases of the Bristol Ringers (before, p. 293), and of the Tettenhall Customary, we have the ancient Ordinances preserved to us through later copies taken one after another.  In the case of Winchester, the record itself, though very ancient, points back to the still earlier "tyme of oure elderne," in which these now "olde" Usages were used, so that this, itself written in the fourteenth century, must be a copy of a still older document.</P><P>The curious picture of the municipal self-government of so important a city as Winchester, presented by these Usages, is of the highest interest.  It not only carries us back to the early municipal and commercial life of the city, and its connexion with the Gild of Merchants (see p. 357), but shows what care our forefathers had, among themselves, ages ago, for the matters that pertain to general health and justice.  As the study of the old laws on those subjects helps the understanding, both of these Usages and of the Ordinances of Worcester and of Bristol, a short summary of some of them will not be out of place here.</P><P>From a very early time the need for establishing some general rules, touching the fair supply of certain necessaries of life, has been recognized in England.  As Lord Coke says, "for weights and measures, there are good laws made before the Conquest;"<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1032">Second Institute, p. 41.</NOTE1> but without going back so far, it is enough to begin with the Magna Charta of John, which contains a chapter (35) declaring that there shall be uniform measures and weights throughout the kingdom.  The substance of this chapter is found in the subsequent confirmatory editions of Magna Charta.  In that confirmed in the 9th year of Henry III., and again in the 25th of Edward I., it stands as follows:—"One measure of wine shall be through our realm, and one measure of ale, and one measure of corn, that is to say, the quarter of London; and one breadth of dyed cloth, russets, and haberjects, that is to say, two yards within the lists.  And it shall be of weights as it is of measures." As the prices of bread and of ale depend on that of corn, the importance of this law was very great.  A general principle was here affirmed, other Statutes however dealt more with details, the examination of which throws much light on many of the clauses in the Winchester Usages.</P><EPB/><PB N="365"/><P>There is a group of three Statutes, usually assigned to the date 51 Hen. III. (1266), of much interest on this subject.  The first of these, called "The Assise of Bread and Ale," begins by settling the weight of the farthing loaf of different qualities of bread relatively to one another, and goes on to fix a table of the relative weight of bread to the price of corn.  The first sentence of this table declares that "when a quarter of wheat is sold for xviii<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>., then wastel bread of a farthing, white and well baked, shall weigh iv<HI1 REND="i">l</HI1>. x<HI1 REND="i">s</HI1>. viii<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>.;" as the wheat increases in price, of course the farthing loaf diminishes in weight, so that when we come to wheat at 20<HI1 REND="i">s</HI1>. the quarter, it only weighs 6<HI1 REND="i">s</HI1>. 9 3/4<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>.  It is further shown what gain there will be to the baker, "as it is proved by the King's bakers."  As to ale, it is declared that "when a quarter of wheat is sold for 3<HI1 REND="i">s</HI1>. or 3<HI1 REND="i">s</HI1>. 4<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>., and a quarter of barley for 20<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>. or 2<HI1 REND="i">s</HI1>., and a quarter of oats for 16<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>.,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1033">They made beer of oats in Berwick (see before, p. 345).</NOTE1>then brewers in cities ought and may well afford to sell two gallons of beer or ale for a penny, and out of cities to sell three gallons for a penny.  And when in a town three gallons are sold for a penny, out of a town they ought and may sell four; and this Assise ought to be holden throughout all England."  Punishments are added for not keeping these Assises.</P><P>The second of these Statutes, "The Judgment of the Pillory," sets forth the manner of making local inquests;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1034">"The Boke for a Justyce" (1541) charges the jury to inquire "of Mayres, Bayliffes, Sheryffes of Towneshyppe, if they haue putte and done their offyces of settynge of the assyse of breade and ale." (Book I. p. 20 b.) See this in active working in Worcester, after, p. 381.</NOTE1> and gives detailed articles of inquiry to be made (among other things) as to weights and measures; the price of wheat, and the agreement therewith of the weight of the "wastel of a farthing" (for default in which "the baker ought to be amerced, or to undergo judgment of the pillory, according to the law and custom of the Court");<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1035">Is not this judgment the "juwyse of the town"?  See p. 355.</NOTE1> the Assise of wine and of ale, and the price of the latter.  It is declared that upon every measure, weight, "and also upon every loaf, the name of the owner shall be distinctly written."</P><P>The third Statute, "Concerning Bakers, &amp;c.," declares that "the Assise of bread shall be kept, according as it is contained in the writing of the Marshalsey<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1036">The "marchasye" of the Usages, before, p. 354.</NOTE1> of our lord the King, delivered unto them, after the sale of wheat, that is to wit, the better, the worse, and the worst.  And as well wastel bread, as other of what sort soever they be, shall be weighed, according as it is said, by the sale of the middle<EPB/><PB N="366"/>corn."  "Every baker shall have a mark of his own for his bread." Bakers and brewers not keeping the Assise are to be punished.</P><P>In "The Mirrour of Justices," written in the time of Edward I., among the articles of inquiry set forth as usually made at the view of frankpledge in the Hundred-court, is the following:—"Of every breach of the Assise of bread, beer, wine, clothes, weights, measures, beams, bushels, gallons, ells and yards, and of all false scales, and of those who have used them."  Like inquiries are directed to be made by the Statute known as "The View of Frankpledge" (18 Edw. II.).</P><P>The Act 23 Edw. III. c. 6 (A.D. 1349) enforces the responsibility of the mayors and bailiffs of cities, boroughs, and sea-ports, for the sale "of all manner of victual" (among which are bread and ale) at "a reasonable price."  This Act is confirmed and re-enforced forty years later by the 13 Rich. II. c. 8.  The Usages of Winchester illustrate the recognition of the responsibility thus declared.</P><P>The making of horse-bread was formerly a regular part of the baker's business.  The Statute 13 Rich. II. Stat. i. c. 8 (1389) ordains "that no hosteller make horse bread in his hostry nor without, but bakers shall make it."  The Ordinances of Worcester also affirm the same (after, pp. 376, 406).  At Exeter the horse-loaf was to be made of "clene benys" (before, p. 337); but the "Assise of Bread" had it that "the lof of <HI1 REND="i">al maner of corn</HI1>, that is to say, the horse lof, shal wey two halfpeny white lofis." (MS. Book of Orders for Bakers, by two Clerks of the Market.  Date about 1468; quoted in Strype's Stow's Survey, cd. 1720, bk. v. p. 341.)  In Elizabeth's time the bakers are to "sell and deliver unto innholders and victuallers in horsebread, but three loaves for a penny, and 13 pennyworth for 12<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>., every one of the same three horse loaves weighing the full weight of a penny white loaf, whether wheat be good, cheap, or dear."  ("Book of Assise," by J. Powel, quoted in Strype, as before, p. 338.)</P><P>As to weights and measures and the care taken to maintain these just, the enactments are too numerous to specify them all here. It has been seen what Magna Charta declared on the matter.  In the Statute "Concerning Bakers, &amp;c." before mentioned, after providing for the maintenance of the imperial standard of bushels, gallons, and yards, it is enacted that "no measure shall be in any town unless it do agree with the King's measure, and be marked with the seal of the commonalty of the town….And all the measures and yards, both great and small, shall be viewed and examined twice in the year….The standard of the bushel, gallon, and yard, and the seals wherewith measures are to be sealed, shall be in the custody of the Mayor and bailiffs, and of six lawful persons of the same town being sworn, before whom all measures shall be sealed."  The Statute <EPB/><PB N="367"/>25 Edw. III. Stat. v. c. 10 (A.D. 1351), after reciting "the Great Charter that one measure shall be throughout England, which Charter hath not been well kept and holden in this point in times past," proceeds to enact "that all the measures, that is to say, bushels, halfbushels, peck, gallon, pottle, and quart, throughout England, within franchises and without, shall be according to the King's standard." This Act was confirmed by an Act of 8 Hen. VI. c. 5 (A.D. 1429), when it was further ordained that a common balance, with common weights sealed according to the Standard of the Exchequer, should be kept in every city, borough, and town.  This appears to have been done in Winchester (see before, p. 356).</P><P>That these enactments were not a mere form, but were carried out in practice, is also illustrated by the following articles of inquiry to be made by the jury of every Court Leet, quoted from "The Maner of Kepynge a Courte Baron and a Lete" (published about 1541).  "Also of all common bakers amonge you that make vnholsom breade for mannes body &amp; kepe nat the assyse, ye shall do vs to wete.  Also of all brewers &amp; tapsters that brewe and kepe nat the assyse, and sel by cuppes, dysshes, and bolles, and by measures vnsealed, ye shall do vs to wete.  Also if there be any amonge you that vsethe double measures, that is to say, a great measure to bye with, and a smaller to sell with, or vseth false ballaunce or weyghts or yardes in deceyte of the kynges people, do vs to wete."</P><P>It will be observed above, in speaking of the Assise of bread, and also in the clauses of the Usages of Winchester touching the sale of bread, that the weights made use of were <HI1 REND="i">pounds</HI1>, <HI1 REND="i">shillings</HI1>, and <HI1 REND="i">pence</HI1>—the baker is to be punished according to the amount that his "ferthing loaf is in default of weight over twelve pence," or "over three shillings" (see before, pp. 354, 355).  A Statute called "The Assise of Weights and Measures" (printed as 31 Ed. I.) is worth study in connexion with this point.  It begins thus:—"By consent of the whole realm the King's measure was made, so that an English penny, which is called the sterling, round without clipping, shall weigh 32 grains of wheat dry in the midst of the ear; 20 pence make an ounce; and 12 ounces make a pound London, to wit, twenty shillings of sterlings; and eight pounds make a gallon of wine; and eight gallons of wine make a bushel of London; which is the eighth part of a Quarter."  The Act gives much curious information as to the value and worth of measures, weights, and computations then declared to be in use.  Among others,—"Item, it is to be known, that the pound of pence, spices, confections, as of electuaries, consisteth in weight of twenty shillings.  But the pound of all other things weigheth twenty-five shillings.  But in electuaries the ounce consisteth of twenty pence, and the pound contains twelve ounces: but in other things the pound <EPB/><PB N="368"/>contains fifteen ounces: but the ounce in either case is in weight twenty pence."</P><P>Ill-seeming men were apt, in ancient times as well as modern, to overreach their neighbours in the way of trade if they could.  Piers Ploughman gives a long string of the sins of Covetous, and makes him confess that<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L>"Wikkedly to weye</L><L>Was my firste lesson;</L><L>To Wy and to Wynchestre</L><L>I wente to the feyre</L><L>With many manere marchaundise.</L><L>Ne hadde the grace of gyle y-go</L><L>Amonges my chaffare.</L><MILESTONE N="* * * *" UNIT="typographic"/><L>My wif was a webbe</L><L>And wollen cloth made.</L><L>She spak to spynnesteres</L><L>To spynnen it oute.</L><MILESTONE N="* * * *" UNIT="typographic"/><L>This craft my wif used.</L><L>Rose the Regrater</L><L>Was hire right name.</L><L>She hath holden hukkerye</L><L>All hire lif tyme." </L><BIBL> (Passus Quartus.)</BIBL></Q1></P><P>The frauds in cloth-making which Covetous here says he used,<Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L>"Till ten yerdes or twelve</L><L>Hadde tolled out thrittene,"</L></Q1>were met by many and various Statutes, of which examples have been given before, pp. 351, 356.</P><P>The Acts directed against "fore-stallers of wines, victuals, wares, and merchandises which come to the good towns within the realm by land or water," (2 R. II. Stat. i. c. 2), engrossers, and regrators,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1037">See before, p. 353.</NOTE1> are numerous, and were continued till comparatively recent times.  The before-named Statute of Bakers, &amp;c. (51 Hen. III.) gives a good specimen of the mode of dealing with a forestaller, who is pointed out in indignant words to be "an open oppressor of poor people and of all the commonalty, and an enemy of the whole shire and country;" it is declared that "he that is convict thereof, the first time shall be grievously amerced, and shall lose the thing so bought, and that according to the custom and ordinance of the town; he that is convict the second time shall have judgment of the pillory; at the third time<EPB/><PB N="369"/>he shall be imprisoned and make fine; the fourth time he shall abjure the town."  And a principal object of the inquiries that used to be systematically made before the administrative officers throughout the country, was to ensure the due execution of the laws against these and other like offences against just and fair trading (see "Ye Office of Shyryffes," about 1530; "The Boke for a Justyce of Peace neuer so wel and dylygently set forthe," 1541, pp. 20 <HI1 REND="i">a</HI1> to 21 <HI1 REND="i">b</HI1>; Lambard's "Eirenarcha," 1614, pp. 349, 450, 607).</P><P>Forestalling, regrating, and engrossing seem to have been, notwithstanding, ever-living offences, for so lately as the year 1800, the "high price of provisions having manifestly been occasioned by forestalling and regrating, more than by any real scarcity," (<HI1 REND="i">Aris's Birmingham Gazette</HI1>, Aug. 4, 1800), the inhabitants of Birmingham were obliged to appoint a Committee for their prevention in the town and neighbourhood. The Committee advertised "clear definitions" of the offences, which agree almost exactly with those given by Statute 250 years before.  ("Century of Birmingham Life," vol. ii. p. 101.  By J. A.

A few small extracts only are in the Appendix, No. 14, to Green's History of Worcester, the body of Ordinances given by him being of a later date (Henry VII.), (see next page).</P><P>Besides the two volumes of "Orders" of the Gild of Joiners and Carpenters (see before, p. 208), the Corporation of Worcester possess two highly interesting volumes of the ancient records of their city.  The first of these, whence the above Ordinances are taken, and the hand-writing of which is contemporary with its contents, is a small folio volume in a plain strong modern binding, lettered at the back "<HI1 REND="i">Ordinances, Edward IV</HI1>.," containing fifty-four leaves of parchment, for <EPB/><PB N="410"/>the most part closely written on both sides, with a broad ruled margin. The book is composed of six "quayers of parchemyn" (see before, p. 379), upon the first three of which, in a clear and regular hand, these Ordinances are written.  The Articles LXXX., LXXXI., LXXXII. appear to have been added later, the style of handwriting and the spelling differ from those of the foregoing, and they are not included in the "Kalender" of the Articles which follows (see before, p. 370).  On the space left on the page between the last of these and the Kalendar have been inserted six other Articles,—the first only of which is in English, the rest being in Latin,—written in a close and crabbed hand; these, relating chiefly to trade, it was not thought necessary to give here.</P><P>The volume however contains, besides the Ordinances now printed, which were made in the time of Edward IV. (1467), a body of "Ordinances, constitucions, &amp; Articles" made by the citizens in the twelfth year of Henry VII. (1497).  The old laws were evidently then "openly redde and declared" (see before, p. 376), and amendments made where found necessary; for these Articles are the same in substance with those of Edward IV., but their arrangement is different, and various additions and transpositions have been made.  Though some of the Articles are fuller, there are not so many as in the earlier body, their number reaching only to thirty-eight, both actually and in the Kalendar of their contents, which, as in the first instance, follows them.</P><P>The next leaf illustrates the old mode of taxation in England; it contains tables showing the sum due from Worcester for tenths and fifteenths, and the proportions to be paid by each ward within the city, at two periods; the first being what was gathered "olim in Wigorn," the second "tempore H. sexti."  Below these are some fees to city officers.  This page seems to have been written out at the same time, and is signed with the same name, as the Ordinances of Henry VII. Next follow transcripts of several of the old city charters, probably some of those ordered by Article I. (see before, p. 376), beginning with that of Edgar, A.D. 964, headed by a curious short historical preface, in which the ancient scribe tells us that Worcester was founded by Wolfhere, King of Mercia, in A.D. 679.  The volume is closed by a curious table of "wages and fees" to the Town-Clerk, and a minute description of the perambulation of the city (the value of which is seen in Article IV., p. 378), made, "as in tymes passid," on 12th April, 1497.  This "perambulation" is printed by Green, Appendix, No. 15.</P><P>The other volume is of a much later date, and appears to be formed of two books which have been bound up together by a modern hand; it is lettered at the back "<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Liber Legum</FOREIGN>."  As has been seen, the volume just described is the true <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Liber Legum</FOREIGN>,—the book of ancient laws of the city;—the second volume however possesses an independent interest of its own, for it not only brings down the history of the local bye-laws, <EPB/><PB N="411"/>but it shows the actual working of an important English institution, now forgotten.  It contains the records of the Courts Leet, or Views of Frankpledge, held in the Gild-hall of Worcester, from 1624 to 1710, at which the laws of the city were perused, amended, and confirmed; the grand jury-men being frequently pointed out as "The Lawmakers." The Leet itself is, in both volumes, often called the "Lawday;" while another proof of the close relations between the municipal body of the city and the Gild, is given by the fact that it is, as often, spoken of as the "yeld" or even "yeld-marchant" (see before, pp. 376, 377, 385).  At the beginning of the volume, and again at the beginning of the second book, are recited and confirmed a body of laws; for, says the preamble thereto, "the particular lawes and constitucions of all Cytties and Corporacions are said to bee the very sinewes and strength of the same, and that noe persons comonly proue more vncivill and vnwise then those which doe contemne and dispise the Authorytie of them."  Many of these treat of the same matters as some of the older Ordinances, but though the "Guild-hall" remains, the Gild-merchant does not seem to be found at this date.  It may be that this Gild had become overshadowed by the number of other Gilds in the city, for in the preamble to a third recital of laws in this volume, made A.D. 1671, for the purpose of obtaining the Justices' signatures under the Act of 19th Henry VII. (see before, p. 210), it is stated that the citizens and inhabitants of Worcester "for the greatest part are vnited into Guilds, ffraternities, and Brotherhoods."</P><P>The intimate connection of the Gild with the Corporate body which appears by many of the Ordinances of Worcester, is found to have existed from the beginning of the Gild.  In a Charter of Henry III. (A.D. 1227) confirming several privileges to the citizens, it is expressly set forth "that they shall have a Gild-merchant with a hanse and other liberties and customs pertaining to the Gild."  In the table of "wages and fees" to the Town-Clerk before-named, after the fee "for entering the name of anyone when he is made a citizen, ij.<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>.," it is stated that "proclamations must be made in the accustomed places four times before the holding of the gild [<FOREIGN>gildam tenendam</FOREIGN>], that all who are citizens and are willing" may appear.  Also "there must be written upon the door of the chamber all the officers of the gild, and the day of the holding the gild, that all who come that way may know when it is to be."  The five pageants of the Craft-gilds, with their lights and their tapers, were kept up by the yearly attention given to them by the grand jury of the Leet (before, pp. 385, 407), and must have much resembled those of the show-loving men of York (before, pp. 140, 143).</P><P>These old Ordinances here given obviously were not the originals, but were, like those of Winchester and others, copied from laws still older. This is seen from some of the Articles themselves, which show that <EPB/><PB N="412"/>they are but those "of old tyme" renewed, or made at "yeldes precedents" (see pp. 377, 382, 397).</P><P>A volume might be written were all the topics of these highly suggestive Ordinances dwelt on.  The officers of the complete municipal government, the High Bailiff and the Low Bailiff; the 24 men of the upper chamber, wearing the chief livery, the 48 men of the commoners, the lower chamber, of the Common Council (see p. 386); the aldermen, chamberlains, recorder, town-clerk, and serjeants, are all named here, with others who were appointed when it was found necessary, as the "judges," and "afferors," or assessors of fines (pp. 379, 395); while the relations of the city to the State are recognized by the Ordinances as to the choice and duties of members of Parliament, and keeping the peace (pp. 393, 385, 388, 389).  As in Winchester, so in Worcester, much heed was given to those things pertaining to health and safety; some of the laws as to nuisances were frequently re-iterated, and in 1657 the grand jury-men indignantly desire that certain laws on that subject "bee without further delay putt in execucon, or else wee desire yo<HI1 REND="sup">u</HI1> doe never trouble anie more lawmakers, for in tyme, if [one of them be] not executed, and sicknesse comes, it is enough to poyson most parte of the Cittie."  The notes to the Winchester Usages (before, pp. 351, 353, 364) apply also to many of these Ordinances which touch on food and trade.</P><P>That these Ordinances were made in the true gild spirit of mutual aid among all is strongly shown by those touching clothmakers and tilers (pp. 383, 399; also before, p. 352, <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>), which betoken a sense of the free rights of the working-men not always carried into practice even at the present day.  And how these laws were neither made in a corner nor kept out of sight of all concerned, is very instructively taught by Articles I. and LXII. (pp. 376, 402), according with the ancient custom in England, which provided, not only for the full assent of the citizens being given to their own laws, but also, for the frequent reading and declaration of them among all the people.</P><SIGNED>[L.

She was remarkable in having among her Gilds one devoted to keeping "the ancient recordes and mynaments, not only of the towne, but also of other societies in other remote places of the kingdome;" whose history, could it be written, would be one of the most curious in England; the unhappy burning of whose library, in A.D. 1466, is recorded before, p. 287.  (See also Dallaway's Antiquities of Bristow, p. 35, <HI1 REND="i">note</HI1>). There seems a note-worthy fitness of things in the circumstance that Robert Ricart (or, as some call him, Ricaut), the Town Clerk who wrote this most interesting record here printed, which adds another instance of the working of the Gilds with corporate bodies in towns, should have been himself a member of the ancient brotherhood of the Kalendars of Bristol.  This fact is mentioned of him by nearly all the histories, upon what authority is not stated, but the inference seems that he so speaks of himself in some of his writings.  (See Pryce, p. 619; Rogers' Calendars of Al Hallowen, Brystowe, p. 165; and others.)</P><P>Since the first two Parts of this volume passed through the press, under my father's eye, I have been enabled, owing to special circumstances and the courtesy of several gentlemen in Bristol, to examine the original work from which Mr. Pocock's MS. was taken, and to make a careful collation of this print.  To those gentlemen, among whom I may mention the Town Clerk of Bristol, my best thanks are due for the facilities they afforded me herein, by which means I have been able, happily, to render this portion of the work more complete than was otherwise possible.</P><EPB/><PB N="429"/><P>In Mr. Pocock's MS., an extract from the beginning of Ricart's Chronicle states that "the Mayor Spencer, 18 Edw. IV. <SUPPLIED>A. D. 1479</SUPPLIED>, commaunded me, Rob. Ricart, the same yere electid and admitted into the office of Town Clerk of the said worshipfull towne, for to deuise, ordaigne, and make this present boke for a remembratif evir hereaftir, to be called and named the Maire of Bristowe is Register, or ellis the Maire is Kalender." (This, in the original, continues as follows)—"In the which boke is and shalbe enregistred a grete parte of the auncient vsages and laudable custumes of the saide worshipfull towne, tyme oute of mynde vsed and exercised in the same; which boke in substance shal rest vpon vj principall matiers."  The subjects of these six "principal matters" or Parts is then set forth at some length, the design of the book apparently being to give a history and descriptive account of the city.  What is here printed is the fourth of these Parts, four pages only having been left out, some of which are cancelled, and seem to be in a different writing.  It is stated by Barrett that besides this Register Ricart was the author of "many curious notices we have in the two red books, the book of wills, orphans, &amp;c." (Hist. of Bristol, p. 456).  See also Corry and Evans' Hist. of Bristol, vol. ii. p. 285, to the same effect.  One of these "red books" is referred to in Ordinances 10, 15, and 16 (before, pp. 416, 419).  The "little Red book" I have seen, and one among the many points of interest connected with it is, that an inscription on parchment, on the outside of the volume, bears the veritable signature of Ricart himself.</P><P>Seyer, in his "Memoirs Historical and Topographical of Bristol," thus describes the "Maire is Kalender." "It is a thick folio, in good preservation, well written, partly on vellum, and partly on paper, ornamented with rude portraits of the kings and several other paintings of the same kind.… About the beginning of Henry VII.'s reign the handwriting changes, and the chronicle is continued by different persons nearly to the present time."  (Pref., pp. xi. xii.)  The part containing the "Office of the Mayor," is also adorned with a very curious painting on vellum representing the ceremony of installation. The paragraphs are not numbered in the original, but figures are here inserted for the sake of convenience; and for the same reason the few side-notes there occurring are here omitted.</P><P>Ricart's Kalendar, or even this portion of it, has never before been printed.  Seyer and Barrett quote short passages; other authors only allude to it; but Evans, in his compendious little work, under the date 1503, when he says Ricart ceased to be Town Clerk, gives the best account of any in a short abstract of the "Office" (Chronological Outline of History of Bristol, p. 127).  Barrett (p. 121), followed by Mr. Lucas in his "Secularia" (p. 115), quotes a part of a speech made by the Mayor on going out of office (apparently another <EPB/><PB N="430"/>version of that given before on p. 415), but without giving any authority for the quotation.</P><P>There can be no doubt that Ricart, writing down these Articles or Ordinances touching the officers and government of the town "for a remembratif evir hereaftir," and exhorting his fellow-officers to study them (see before, p. 413), copied them from some older and well-known laws, as indeed is shown by several of the Ordinances themselves (10, 15), and by the phrase used at the beginning of many of them, "hit hath be usid."  They form no exception in this respect to the other examples of ordinances given in this volume.  It may be remarked that Ricart actually has written them down in the order of the Calendar according to the modern sense of the word, beginning with 1st September and ending at Christmas.</P><P>Incomplete as this body of Ordinances is, many of them contain provisions as to matters concerning the general welfare and good municipal government parallel to those of Berwick, Winchester, and Worcester; ordinances of which the best example hitherto published is found in the Liber Albus of London.  But the most important point as regards the subject of the present volume is, that these ordinances show the amicable connection of the Craft Gilds with the corporate body of the city, the Mayor evidently having possessed a ministerial function in confirming the election of the masters of the crafts (see Ord. 16), similar to that which he exercised as to the ordinances of the Gild of Fullers (see before, p. 286).  The famous Gild of Kalendars held a high and honourable place in the good graces of the city (see before, pp. 287, 417), and the relation of the officers of the corporation with other crafts appears to have been of much the same sort as it was in Worcester (Ordinances 27, 28).  The crafts also appear to have attended the Mayor and other officers on vigils, as they did in Worcester (before, p. 408), and to have found it thirsty work, for Barrett (p. 125) cites from "the great White Book" that "20th May, 28 Hen. VI., it was ordained by Wm. Canynges, Mayor, and the Common Council, that the drinking at St. John's and St. Peter's nights should be wholly to persons of crafts, going the nights before the Mayor, Sheriff, and other notable persons; and that the Mayor and Sheriff on forfeiture of five marks a-piece, the one at St. John's night, the other at St. Peter's, should dispense wine to be disposed of to the said crafts at their halls: viz. to the weavers and tuckers each 10 gallons," enumerating 26 crafts, who were to have 94 gallons of wine among them. The "Canynges" here named was the celebrated William Canynges, the merchant of Bristol, four times her Mayor, and her benefactor in many ways; also the munificent restorer of Redcliff church, where he founded two chantries (see before, pp. 416, 421).</P><P>Like Worcester, Bristol also had a Gild Merchant, for according to <EPB/><PB N="431"/>Barrett "it appears by the great Red Book of Bristol, p. 30, that the Mayor, bailiffs, and commonalty had a free guild of merchants in the town and suburb from time beyond the memory of man, and all things belonging to a guild" (p. 179).  What further discoveries this "great Red Book" has to disclose must however await a future time.</P><P>The lover of old English manners and customs will find in Ricart's quaint descriptions of ceremonies and of what we are accustomed to call "sports," but which were evidently matters of seriousness, much to gratify his curiosity and study.  Much light is thrown upon Ordinances 18 to 22, and 30 to 32, by passages too long to quote here, in Strutt's "Sports and Pastimes," pp. 339, 346; and Brand's "Popular Antiquities," vol. i. pp. 308, 321-336.<LB/>[L.T.S.]</P><P>[NOTE.—On a later examination of the Bristol books I found that Barrett had made several errors in the passage quoted in the last paragraph of p. 430, which is taken from the <HI1 REND="i">Great Red Book</HI1>, fol. xiiii. <HI1 REND="i">b</HI1>, not from the <HI1 REND="i">White Book</HI1>; it should run as follows:—"the drinking at St. John's and St. Peter's nights should utterly be lefte among persons of crafts, going the nights before the Mayor, Sheriff, and notable persons; and that the Mayor and Sheriff on forfeiture of five marks apiece, the one at St. John's night, the other at St. Peter's, should dispense wine to be disposed to the said crafts at their halls: viz. to the weavers and tuckers each 10 gallons, provided that the craftsmen send their own servants with their own potts for the same."</P><P>Ricart's Kalendar was printed by the Camden Society, 1872.</P><SIGNED>L.T.S. 1892.]</SIGNED></DIV3></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:6.5" TYPE="record"><EPB/><PB N="432"/><HEAD>IV. <LB/>THE COSTOMARY OF TETTENHALL REGIS.</HEAD><OPENER>A Trew coppy of the Costomary of the mannor of Tettenhall regis, coppied out of one taken out of the Originall, the 22<HI1 REND="sup">d</HI1> of July 1604.</OPENER><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1055">As before stated (p. 348), two copies of the Customary were kindly placed in my father's hands.

This copy, while it is more complete, and spelled of course according to the more modern style, contains several variations from the older copy, which however consist chiefly of turns of expression not affecting the general tenour of the bye-laws.

The oldest copy known is the one given above, which, as is declared on its title, is of the date of 1604.  Mr. Neve's later copy, from the same original, is written on paper which bears the water-mark of 1817, and as the differences in it go so far as to show that it cannot have been taken from this earlier copy, there must have been in existence, fifty years ago, either the original Customary itself or another duplicate of it.  In Mr. Neve's MS. (in which the bye-laws are followed by a "true Rent Role" of the tenants) mention is made, at the end, of four separate copies, one of which is described as "more antient, subseribed by a jury of the tenants at a Court Leet;" the others were all made in 1604.</P><P>Whatever the actual age of this Customary may be, there is no doubt that it contains the bye-laws made by the tenants of the manor at their Leet or Law-day, from time to time; and is an important illustration of the exercise of the practice of making such laws for their own guidance formerly in active use in every neighbourhood all over the country. Winchester and Worcester have afforded other instances of the same ancient practice, differing from these in details in proportion as the corporation and the manor have grown up, different institutions, developed from the same original germ.  And this leads to the reasons for the introduction in this volume of a document that at first sight might seem foreign to its subject-matter.  Regrets are now unavailing that the note, full of research and intimate knowledge of the laws and principles upon which English society has rested for ages, which my Father intended here, was left unwritten.  It must be enough to say

now, that he would have explained the methods in use from the earliest times, by which, when men met together in their different neighbourhoods —parishioners, villaners, citizens and others—they appointed some of their own number, sworn to the truth and their duty, to make the bye-laws to which all present should assent, and to inquire and see that those laws were kept; methods which, anciently having as a principal end the maintaining of the peace-pledge and the rights of property, continued to be kept up not only, in the words of Lord Coke, "for conservation of the king's peace, and punishment of common nusances," but that the tenants and resiants should have justice "done unto them at their own doores without any charge or losse of time" (4th Institute, p. 263; 2nd Institute, p. 71).  How the spirit which guided them, though the forms might be changed, had ruled through these and like institutions, from the days when Domesday Book was given in as a true record of the finding of the juries of all the country; to the times when the Sheriffs sent in their returns of how men, on their own showing, demeaned themselves in their social, commercial, and other gatherings in Gilds; and again, when the Courts Leet and Courts Baron of the most insignificant parish or the most important city alike were discharging their duties to themselves and their neighbours; and how it was still the same English spirit of mutual responsibility and self-reliance: all this and more would have been clearly shown and have been illustrated by quotations from record and manuscript.</P><P>In the absence of this exposition, the following passages from a letter published by my Father in the <HI1 REND="i">Birmingham Journal</HI1> of 4th May, 1867, will not be inappropriate here, while the subsequent quotations, suggestively given, will serve to carry on further the story that is told by the Customary of Tettenhall.</P><P>"There were in Birmingham, as elsewhere, two distinct Courts and sets of Records; namely, the Court Leet, with its records,—and the Court Baron, with its records.  The distinction is important and significant. Every male inhabitant, of fit age, was bound to attend the Court Leet, and was liable to be fined if absent.  At the Court Baron, only those were bound to attend who held land under the custom of the manor.  Both were popular assemblies; and the study of the system of local self-government, which each of them worked very effectively, is one of the most interesting and instructive studies that any lover of free institutions can take up.</P><P>"But the Court Leet was a court chiefly of criminal procedure; while the Court Baron dealt with the rights of property, and the course of inheritance, and the different obligations that existed between the lord of the manor and the owners of land.  Each Court had the power of making bye-laws; and these bye-laws were of the utmost importance to the welfare of every place.  No lord of any manor could impose <EPB/><PB N="440"/>bye-laws.  These could only be made in the open Court; and it rested with the Court itself to declare what the customs of the manor were."</P><P>Tettenhall has given an instance of the embodiment of such customs into a standing "Customary."  What next follow show them in use in other places, and give an instance of how they were declared.</P><P>The Court Rolls of Bushey in Hertfordshire, extending from the 15th of Henry VIII. to the 38th of Elizabeth (1523 to 1596), which fell into my Father's possession, are in a very perfect state.  The records of the Court Leet and of the Court Baron are sewn up together, but though they often appear to have been held on the same day and are then recorded on the same strip of parchment, they are always kept entirely distinct.  They are written in Latin, much contracted, as was usual in such documents.  At the "View of Frankpledge with a Court" held on 27th July, in the 1st Edward VI. (1548), a jury of thirteen is sworn; they present upon their oaths that eleven named men owe suit to the View [that is, ought to have come to the court] and make default, each is therefore amerced.  They present "that Humfrey Corston and John ffoxe are the common bakers of man's bread [in distinction to horse-bread, see before, p. 366] and have broken the assise;" also "that Thomas Ravensby, John Smythe, and Thomas Hamond are the common brewers of ale, and sell by unlawful measures [vasa];" also "that the common tipplers sell by measures not sealed," all which offenders are then amerced.  On 16th April, in the 22nd Elizabeth (1580), we find the jury (sixteen men) ordering "that Thomas Atkines shall scour his ditch before the feast of the nativity of St. John the Baptist next, under pain of forfeiting to the lord, for every yard, iiij<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>;" four others are ordered to do the like: it is also ordered that "no one shall break the hedges," that two other men shall "remove their dunghills," and that "every one shall ring his swine before the said feast of Pentecost," all under penalties.  At this Leet too were chosen, as usual, the officers for the year, constables, headboroughs [capitales plegii], and ale-tasters.  At the Court Baron of 27th July, 1st Edward VI., the sworn men of the homage present that "Humfrey Conyngesby esquire, William Blakewell gentleman, Henry Goodyere gentleman, Robert Smythe, Dorothy Pavyor widow," and others owe suit to the court, and, making default, they are amerced.  Among other presentments, the homage say that a "rent of ten shillings, arising from a certain mill called Watford Mylle," was not paid "on the death of William Davyd to the bailif of the manor;" that "Richard Scott, holding by custom of the lord, has died since the last court, who at the time of his death held of the lord for himself and his heirs, according to the custom of the manor," certain properties, and they declare what heriot is due, and who is the right successor, who is then admitted in full court.  On the 28th June, 8th Elizabeth, <EPB/><PB N="441"/>there was held a Court Baron, apparently the first after the succession of a new lord to the manor, when the property, and the tenure by which each was held of a long list of tenants, were declared. It is to be supposed that there was needed some reminder of the customs or bye-laws of the manor at this time, for at the next court, held 7th February, 9th Elizabeth (1566), after the usual business, there is entered on the Roll a document which is in fact a "Customary" of Bushey, the origin of which is thus stated:—"Whereas at the last court the homage were ordered, upon their oaths, to present at this next court held for the said manor what the customs of the said manor may be, upon certain articles then given in writing and in order by the steward of the manor; the homage have come, and present in writing as follows;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1096">This preamble is in Latin, the "Answer" is in English; besides being entered on the Roll at length, an indented copy of the original, signed by the homagers, is tacked on to the middle of the parchment strip. </NOTE1>  The Aunswere and verdytt of Walter Wythe, Robert Blackwell, <SUPPLIED>and nineteen others</SUPPLIED> custumary tenaunts of the mannor of Busshey in the countie of Hertf., to certayne artycles gyuen them in charge vpon ther othes to enquyer of by Andrewe Joyner gent., lorde of the sayde mannor, touching and concerning the customes of the seid Mannor of Busshey.  <HI1 REND="i">Imprimis</HI1>, to the fyrste artycle we saye that no copy holder at the tyme of his deathe dying seased of twoe coppyholds hath payde any more then one quycke herryott, by the tyme of our remembraunce or before, to our knowledge.  <HI1 REND="i">Item</HI1>, to the seconde we saye that the lorde oughte to haue the seconde best for hys herryott, and the heyer the beste.  <HI1 REND="i">Item</HI1>, to the thyrde we saye that no coppyholder that doeth surrender hys coppyholde oughte to paye any herryott vpon the surrender of hys coppyholde excepte yt be in extremis of deathe.  <HI1 REND="i">Item</HI1>, to the fourthe we saye that the lords of this mannor haue neuer demaunded, nor any coppyholder payde, any more for ther ffyne then one yeres rente of the lande.  <HI1 REND="i">Item</HI1>, to the ſyfeth we saye that the wedowe after the deathe of her husbande shall haue the thyrde parte of the rente of the lande.  But not the thyrde parte of the lande excepte yt be surrendred to her by her husbonde."  The answer to the twelfth question lets us into a reason for making a new customary, "we knowe not where the courte rolles, rentalls, or customaryes of this mannor are remayning, or in whose custodye," though that the Rolls for a period of more than forty years previously were afterwards found is proved by their present entire existence.  The replies go on through a number of customs, too long to give here.</P><P>The Roll of the Court Leet of the Manor of Bromfield, Shropshire, for the 2nd October in the 4th year of James I. (1607), also in my Father's possession, after the names of the tenants and jurymen, gives <EPB/><PB N="442"/>
the presentments and the orders made for each hamlet within the jurisdiction of the court.  Among these are the following:—"By W<HI1 REND="sup">m</HI1> Lane and John Farlowe, present W<HI1 REND="sup">m</HI1> Pingell for dryving cattell throw the lordship, contrary to a former order, whereby he hath forfeted the peine before this layd down for suche offenders, the pein being vs.…At this court, with thassent of the Lorde and tennants, that all thinhabitants of this lordship yoke or ring their swine sufficiently and soe kepe them from tyme to tyme, vpon peine of xij<HI1 REND="i">d</HI1>. euery one making default. … At this court, for avoyding of controversies betwext W<HI1 REND="sup">m</HI1> Lane and Rich.

Richard Genins sayth that margory Davies, sometime dwelling on Chep street, wold not remove her habitacion onles she might haue a way conveniently and quietly to passe from the kings high way to and from a pasture called Hadwell, wherevpon Charles ffoxe esquire, father of Sir Charles ffoxe knight, and nowe L. of the manor, appoynted and gave her a free way out from Hadwell to the kings high way, as well vpon the lande belonging to the tenement she had by exchange as also vpon other lande she had by gift and exchange of other landes taken by the said Charles ffoxe esquire of John Maunders and Roger Hill.  2. George ffauconer likewise sworn, deposeth and sayth as the former deponent, that the said Margerie Davies, making an exchange of her tenement by commaundment of the said Charles ffoxe esquire, had a way for her appoynted and sett down, which is nowe the way where the hedge goeth by, whiche way was over the endes of John Preeces, Maunders, and Hills landes, left by Genins who plowed those landes.  And so the said Margery vsed that way continually during her lief.  And vpon this the way ordered accordingly.… At this court also, with the agrement of the lorde, it is ordered and concluded by the homage that John Hill shall haue, vse, and occupie the Pytt and trees thereon growing, and according as his ancesters vsed the same, and as his witnesses have proved, wherunto the homage vpon their oath haue geaven their verdyet."</P><P>These are but some out of numerous illustrations of the doing of "justice at their own doors" by the people themselves, once in use all over the land.</P><SIGNED>[L.

GEORGE, NORWICH.]</HEAD><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1097"><P>From the Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian Library, Misc. 1370.  After the earlier set of ordinances of the same Gild, given before on p. 17, was in print, this fuller set of ordinances was found among the Rawlinson MSS., for a copy of which, and collation of the print, readers of this work are indebted to Mr. G. Parker, of Oxford.  The original is in the form of a book of eight leaves of vellum, 12 1/2 by 8 1/2 inches in size, of which the edges have been cut, thereby slightly injuring the text.  The first page is very indistinct, several words being nearly illegible, but with the help of the next mentioned, these were able to be made out.</P><P>A third set of ordinances, nearly but not quite identical with those printed in this Appendix, is to be found in an "Account of the Company of St. George in Norwich," taken from Mackarell's MS. History of Norwich (1737), and printed in vol. iii. of the Transactions of the Norfolk Archæological Society, a copy of which I have received through the kindness of Mr. J. L'Estrange of Norwich.  The ordinances are said to have been copied from a folio MS.  belonging to the Company, "Book I, marked A," and so closely resemble those here given as to show they must have been taken from the same original.  In one point they differ, the date of the foundation of the Gild is put as 1324, 18 Edward II., sixty years earlier than the date given in the Rawlinson MS., which herein agrees with the Return made to Parliament (see before, p. 17).  This date, 1324, is probably an error of the transcriber; the Letters Patent and License of Mortmain granted by Henry V. in 1418, cited above, speak of the Gild as "for thirty years past and more continually governed," &amp;c., which points to 1385 as the true date. (See Madox, <HI1 REND="i">Firma Burgi</HI1>, p. 24, ed. 1726.) The Gild of St. George grew into great power and importance, and close connection with the Corporation, as is shown by the "mediation" made by one "Judge Yelverton, betwixt the Mayre, Shreves, and Cōalte of the Cite of Norwyche" and the Aldermen and bretheren of the Gild, in 1452 (printed in the same Transactions), as well as by some of their ordinances (see after, p. 452).  The list of names at the end is interesting for the testimony it affords of the sort of persons who joined the Gild,—men of rank, both lay and ecclesiastical, being enrolled among them, and evidently having served in its offices,—and of the large number these reached.  Blomefield, who gives a long account of the Gild, with several curious inventories, in his History of Norfolk (1745), vol. ii., mentions the names of many famous persons who belonged to it in different years, among which in 1495 is that of Sir John Paston.  Many rolls of accounts and books of the Gild are still extant in the archives of the Corporation of Norwich, reaching back as far as the reigns of Henry V. and Henry VI., and the gleanings from these that have been printed show its wealth, and the rich stores of goods and jewels used in the grand and stately pageants or "riding" of the brotherhood on St. George's day.  One among the relies existing when Blomefield wrote was an ancient sword of wood which had "the dragons head carved at top, sent by King Henry V.," which used to be carried before the Alderman of the Gild and the Mayor of Norwich as the ex-Alderman (vol. ii. p. 894).

Poems, Genesis and Exodus, &amp;c.).</P><P>2nd pers. sing. in -<HI1 REND="i">est</HI1> (Northern and West-Midland -<HI1 REND="i">es</HI1>).</P><P>3rd pers. sing. in -<HI1 REND="i">eth</HI1> (Northern and West-Midland -<HI1 REND="i">es</HI1>).</P><P>1st, 2nd, and 3rd pers. pl. in -<HI1 REND="i">en</HI1> (of very rare occurrence in Northern dialect).</P><P>The Gilds of Lynn are slightly more Northern than those of Norwich, &amp;c., as is seen by the occasional use of the 3rd person singular in -<HI1 REND="i">es</HI1> (or -<HI1 REND="i">etz</HI1>).</P><P>The employment of <HI1 REND="i">qw</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">wh</HI1> or <HI1 REND="i">hw</HI1> (as <HI1 REND="i">qwat</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">what</HI1>) has already been pointed out by me as an instance of Northern usage prevailing in East- and West-Midland dialects, but which never found its way into the Southern dialects.</P><P>The London Gilds (as well as the Cambridge ones) contain no instances of <HI1 REND="i">qw</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">wh</HI1>, and no participles in -<HI1 REND="i">end</HI1> or -<HI1 REND="i">and</HI1>. It may be stated once for all that the Gilds of London are a little more modern in form than those of Norwich, &amp;c., and there is an absence too of those Northern peculiarities which occasionally occur in the other Midland Gilds.  Chaucer's dialect, <EPB/><PB N="461"/>which is East-Midland, was that of the metropolis, and, as Garnett has pointed out, presents an unmistakable likeness to the older East-Midland records; Gower's English has a few more strongly marked East-Midlandisms, such as participles in -<HI1 REND="i">end</HI1>, than Chaucer, which led Garnett to think the Confessio Amantis was a little more Northern than the best MSS. of the Canterbury Tales.</P><P>The infinitive mood in the Norwich, &amp;c. Gilds ends in -<HI1 REND="i">en</HI1> or -<HI1 REND="i">e</HI1>, though there is an occasional loss of the inflexion.</P><P>The present participle terminates in -<HI1 REND="i">inge</HI1> (pp. 14, 18, 33, 37, &amp;c.), -<HI1 REND="i">end</HI1> (pp. 30, 33, 37), or -<HI1 REND="i">and</HI1> (pp. 15, 16, 22, 25). Capgrave, an East-Midland writer, employs -<HI1 REND="i">and</HI1>.</P><P>Passive participles of strong verbs end in -<HI1 REND="i">en</HI1>, the <HI1 REND="i">n</HI1> being but seldom dropped.</P><P>The prefix <HI1 REND="i">i</HI1>- or <HI1 REND="i">y</HI1>- is of rare occurrence.  <HI1 REND="i">Arn</HI1> (aren) occurs as well as <HI1 REND="i">ben</HI1> in Norwich and Lynn Gilds.</P><P><HI1 REND="i">Schun</HI1> (pp. 67, 101, 109), is probably written for <HI1 REND="i">schūn</HI1>, i. e. <HI1 REND="i">schullen</HI1> or <HI1 REND="i">schuln</HI1> (see Mr. Smith's note, p. 109).</P><P><HI1 REND="i">Es</HI1> = is, and <HI1 REND="i">sal</HI1> = shall (Northern forms), occur in the Wygnale and Cranborne Gilds.</P><P><HI1 REND="i">Gare</HI1> (Northern) is found in Cranborne Gild.</P><P>In NOUNS we find a <HI1 REND="i">few</HI1> plurals in -<HI1 REND="i">n</HI1> (unknown to the Northern dialect), as <HI1 REND="i">bretheren</HI1> and <HI1 REND="i">sisteren</HI1>, but the ordinary plural ending is -<HI1 REND="i">es</HI1> (or -<HI1 REND="i">is</HI1>).  The old genitive plural -<HI1 REND="i">ene</HI1> is of rare occurrence; it appears under the form -<HI1 REND="i">yn</HI1> in <HI1 REND="i">Halwyn</HI1>, p. 14.</P><P>In ADJECTIVES the grammatical use of the final <HI1 REND="i">e</HI1> seems to have been for the most part disregarded.</P><P>The old adjectival suffix -<HI1 REND="i">lic</HI1> is softened down to -<HI1 REND="i">lich</HI1> (and the -<HI1 REND="i">lice</HI1> of adverbs to -<HI1 REND="i">liche</HI1>).  The Lynn Gilds present occasional instances of the more Northern -<HI1 REND="i">lyke</HI1>, as well as the use of the Northern <HI1 REND="i">ilk</HI1>, for <HI1 REND="i">ech</HI1>, &amp;c., each, &amp;c. (Wygnale has <HI1 REND="i">kirke</HI1> where the other Gilds read <HI1 REND="i">chirche</HI1>).</P><P>The PRONOUNS are those we find in all East-Midland writers of the fourteenth century—<HI1 REND="i">thei</HI1> = they; <HI1 REND="i">her, here</HI1>=their; <HI1 REND="i">hem</HI1>= them.</P><P><HI1 REND="i">þam</HI1> (a Northern form) occurs in Wygnale Gild.</P><P><HI1 REND="i">þer</HI1>=their, occurs in Norwich Gild, p. 443, <HI1 REND="i">their</HI1>, p. 444.</P><P><HI1 REND="i">Hese</HI1>=his (the reading of the Cambridge Chaucer MS. used by Mr. Furnivall in his <HI1 REND="i">Six-Text edition of Chaucer</HI1>) occurs in the Cranborne Gild.</P><P>The Worcester Ordinances, which have a very modern form, present but little variation from the East-Midland dialect. In the older specimens of the dialect the Southern element was strongly marked, but in the Ordinances the Midland element predominates.</P><P>The prefix <HI1 REND="i">i</HI1>- or <HI1 REND="i">y</HI1>- is not lost in these Ordinances, as in the Northern dialects. (See pp. 395, 404.)  No present participles in -<HI1 REND="i">end</HI1> or -<HI1 REND="i">and</HI1> are met with.</P><P>The pronominal forms are mixed, as <HI1 REND="i">ther</HI1> and <HI1 REND="i">her</HI1> (also <HI1 REND="i">hur</HI1>, which may be compared with the old West-Midland <HI1 REND="i">hor</HI1>), <HI1 REND="i">hem</HI1> and <HI1 REND="i">them</HI1>.</P></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="EGilds:8.2" TYPE="section"><HEAD>The Winchester Roll (pp. 349-363).</HEAD><P>"The Old Usages of the Cite of Wynchester," though much more modern than the Ayenbite of Inwyt, A.D. 1340, is somewhat more archaic than the English of the Midland and Northern districts written in the fourteenth century.</P><P>It is of course written in the Southern dialect (all the plurals of the present indicative ending always in -<HI1 REND="i">eth</HI1>), but is not so strongly provincial as the Ayenbite.  Though we have occasionally <HI1 REND="i">v</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">f</HI1>, as <HI1 REND="i">vyȝtyng</HI1> =  fighting, we have not ȝ for <HI1 REND="i">s</HI1>, as in the old Kentish speech; <HI1 REND="i">e</HI1> occasionally occurs, as in Kentish for <HI1 REND="i">i</HI1> or <HI1 REND="i">u</HI1>, as <HI1 REND="i">wheche</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">whiche, treweleche</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">treweliche, undurnemere</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">undernimere, onleche</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">onliche, meche</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">miche, þelke</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">þilke</HI1>.</P><P>The Winchester Roll has a simple vowel where the Old Kentish had a diphthong, thus <HI1 REND="i">chese</HI1> and <HI1 REND="i">lese</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">chiese</HI1> and <HI1 REND="i">liese, yseld</HI1> for <HI1 REND="i">yseald</HI1>, &amp;c.  Like the Ayenbite it keeps up old forms, as <HI1 REND="i">habbe, legge, bygge</HI1>, &amp;c., which are softened down in the Northern dialects to <HI1 REND="i">haue, leye, beye</HI1>, &amp;c.</P><P>NOUNS.—Distinctions of the old genders and cases are not so strictly preserved as in the Ayenbite.  A few plurals in <HI1 REND="i">-n</HI1> occur, as <HI1 REND="i">shon</HI1> = shoes, <HI1 REND="i">lapen</HI1> = <HI1 REND="i">leapen</HI1> = baskets; <HI1 REND="i">hynen</HI1> = servants.</P><P>We have a remnant of the old genitive plural -<HI1 REND="i">ene</HI1> in <HI1 REND="i">halowene tud</HI1>, p. 351.</P><P>ADJECTIVES.—The distinction between the definite and indefinite form is still preserved.</P><P>The case inflections preserved by the Ayenbite are here entirely dropped.</P><P>The DEFINITE ARTICLE seems to be uninflected, as at present.  Only one plural of <HI1 REND="i">this</HI1> occurs, viz. <HI1 REND="i">thes</HI1>.</P><P>PRONOUNS.—The first personal pronoun does not occur, but was probably <HI1 REND="i">ich</HI1>; the dative <HI1 REND="i">hym</HI1> seems to have altogether supplanted the accusative <HI1 REND="i">hine; hii</HI1> = they, <HI1 REND="i">here</HI1> = their, <HI1 REND="i">hem</HI1> = them, as in most of the Southern dialects, but the broader forms of the Ayenbite, <HI1 REND="i">har</HI1> = here, <HI1 REND="i">ham</HI1> = them, do not occur in the Roll.</P><P>We have one instance of an oblique case of the relative, in <HI1 REND="i">þan</HI1>, p. 357, a form very common in the Ayenbite.</P><P>VERBS.—Infinitives in -<HI1 REND="i">y</HI1> (-<HI1 REND="i">ye</HI1>) are exceedingly common, as in all Southern dialects.</P><P>The gerundial or dative infinitive in the Ayenbite ends in -<HI1 REND="i">ne</HI1> or -<HI1 REND="i">e</HI1>, but in the Winchester Roll it terminates in -<HI1 REND="i">ynge</HI1>, as in Trevisa; cf. <HI1 REND="i">to wetynge</HI1>, p. 349.  <HI1 REND="i">To don</HI1> (p. 350) is the only gerundial infinitive in -<HI1 REND="i">n</HI1>.</P><P>Passive particles retain the prefix <HI1 REND="i">y</HI1>, as <HI1 REND="i">y-seyd</HI1>, &amp;c., but drop the <HI1 REND="i">n</HI1> (in strong verbs) as in the Ayenbite, e.g. <HI1 REND="i">yswore</HI1> = <HI1 REND="i">ysworen</HI1>, &amp;c.</P><P>Present participles end in -<HI1 REND="i">ynge</HI1> (see <HI1 REND="i">comynge</HI1>, p. 354), instead of -<HI1 REND="i">inde: folwande</HI1>, on p. 360, is probably a blunder, as participles in <HI1 REND="i">ande</HI1> are not found in any Southern dialect of the fourteenth century.</P></DIV2></DIV1></BACK><EPB/></TEXT></DLPSTEXTCLASS>
