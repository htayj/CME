For this volume, Horstman's organization has largely been preserved.  The texts are grouped by MS at the div1 level (with two exceptions; see below), and presented in the order given by Horstman: Rawlinson C 285, Harley 1022, Cambridge Dd.V.55, and the Lincoln Thornton MS from <TITLE>Yorkshire Writers</TITLE>, vol. 1, and de Worde's early pseudo-Rolle editions, pieces from the Vernon MS, and a miscellaneous category, "Works Wrongly Attributed to R. Rolle," from vol. 2.  (The pb element indicates volume as well as page number for Horstman's edition throughout.)  Normally, individual texts are given at the div2 level; where Horstman prints variants from other MSS, each MS reading is given at the div3 level (base MS first, then variant[s]).  The source for each is marked with head tags and also appears as the value of the "n" attribute.  The genuine, or arguably genuine, Rolle material has been silently excised from this volume, as have all pieces in verse or Latin prose (Latin quotations and lines of poetry contained within English prose works are retained).  The material in Horstman's appendices to vol. 1, from MSS Thornton and Arundel 507, is also omitted.  As a result, gaps in Horstman's pagination are frequent.</P><P>Horstman's presentation has required a greater degree of editorial tinkering in the case of certain texts included in the Thornton MS section.  A lengthy passage from the Thornton copy of <TITLE>The Mirror of St. Edmund</TITLE> does not appear in the Vernon MS copy, and is marked here with seg tags (Horstman indicates the beginning and end of this passage with a large X).  As the Thornton copy of Walter Hilton's <TITLE>On the Mixed Life</TITLE> is deficient at the beginning, the Vernon copy is treated as the base text, with the Thornton following.  Additional opening and closing material from the printed editions, which Horstman prints concurrently with the opening and closing sections of the Vernon copy (1: 264-6, 292), has here been consolidated at the div3 level, and follows the Thornton text.  The policy of excising material possibly by Rolle from the present volume has been suspended in the case of the Thornton text of <TITLE>The Abbey of the Holy Ghost</TITLE>.  This work, given in the Rolle volume, is also reproduced here because Horstman prints its companion piece, <TITLE>The Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost</TITLE> (definitely not by Rolle and so not included in the Rolle volume), as a continuation of <TITLE>The Abbey</TITLE>; however, as <TITLE>The Charter</TITLE> is absent from Thornton, he gives the text from Laud misc. 210.  In order to preserve Horstman's organization and to avoid the inelegance of including in the Thornton section a freestanding text from a different MS, <TITLE>Abbey</TITLE> and <TITLE>Charter</TITLE> are given here as divisions at the div3 level of a single text.  Horstman prints some additional English prose from the Thornton MS in an appendix (1: 377-9, 383-92); this is not included in the present volume.</P><P>The section Horstman designates "Early Editions of Works of R. Rolle" is here renamed "De Worde's Early Editions, Attributed to Rolle," in order to make clear the basis for relegating these texts to the companion volume.  Note that this section does not parallel the single-MS sections in that each edition occupies the div2 level, each text within it the div3.</P><P>The concluding section, "Works Wrongly Attributed to R. Rolle," comprises various pieces which were attributed to Rolle by Horstman's predecessors or contemporaries, or which bear Rolle's name in MS.  They are drawn from miscellaneous MSS otherwise unrepresented in <TITLE>Yorkshire Writers</TITLE>: Harley 1706, Royal 17.A.xxv, Rawlinson C 894, and Univ. Coll. Oxford 97.  The Rolle canon Horstman sought to rectify by assembling material under this rubric is by now so obsolete as to make the grouping seem rather arbitrary, but the category is still useful as a repository of leftover material.</P><P>Horstman regularly inserts bracketed (sometimes parenthetical) corrections in his text without indicating a source for the emendations.  It often appears that he is simply reconstructing what he takes, on no specific textual authority, to be the original reading.  His brackets and parentheses are here retained as data.  When a source is identified (e.g., when a  lacuna is filled from a different MS), the added text is enclosed in supplied tags, with the source given as the value of the "n" attribute.  Horstman also occasionally records his surprise at certain MS readings with an interjected (!), again retained as data.</P><P>Note as well the following differences between Horstman's printed text and the present edition: 1) Horstman's sections devoted to MSS Cambridge Dd.V.64 (1: 3-82) and Arundel 507 (1: 132-56) are omitted entirely, as all the English prose appearing in them is given in the Rolle volume.  2) To avoid confusion, the titles of individual works are given as they appear in the <TITLE>Manual of Writings in Middle English, 1050-1500</TITLE> (Ed. J. Burke Severs and Albert E. Hartung, New Haven, CT: Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1993).  Horstman's headings have been retained for pieces not specifically referred to in the Manual.  However, as the excision of certain pieces disrupts Horstman's practice of numbering consecutively each text he prints from a given MS, the numbers have been eliminated; texts identified by number alone have been given names derived from their incipits or opening lines.  3) Obsolete MS designations and shelf-marks have been updated.  4) Expansions marked with italics in Horstman's text are given silently in the present edition; Horstman's introduction, textual notes and other editorial commentary have been omitted.  New notes have been inserted when necessary to clarify relationships between texts, to identify sources, or to provide other useful information.</P><P>In addition to the English prose contents of the first appendix to vol. 1, the following texts have inadvertently evaded inclusion in the present volume: the <TITLE>Twelve Profits of Tribulation</TITLE>, the sermon <TITLE>"Of the Double Coming of Christ"</TITLE> and the brief <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">"Epistola ad simplices sacerdotes"</FOREIGN> from Royal 17.B.xvii (2: 45-63); and the prose version of <TITLE>The Gast of Gy</TITLE> in the Vernon MS, given by Horstman as a companion to the metrical version in Cotton Tiberius E.vii (2: 292-333).</P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE N="Latin" ID="LAT">Latin</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE><TEXTCLASS><KEYWORDS><TERM>English prose literature -- Middle English, 1100-1500.</TERM><TERM>English language -- Middle English, 1100-1500 -- Texts.</TERM><TERM>Mysticism -- England</TERM></KEYWORDS></TEXTCLASS></PROFILEDESC></HEADER><TEXT><BODY><DIV1 NODE="rollecmp:1" TYPE="MS" N="Rawlinson C 285"><EPB/><PB N="[1: 104]"/><HEAD>Prose Treatises of Ms. Rawl.

<EPB/><PB N="1: 178"/>

þe as me thynke. / Qwen a saule is purified be lufe of god, illumyned be
wysdome, stabild be þe myȝte of god, þan is þe eyghe of þe saule opynde to
behalde gastly thyngys, as vertuse &amp; aungels &amp; haly saulys, &amp; heuenly thyngys.
Þan is þe saule habyl be cause of clennes to fele þe towchynge, þe spekynge
of gude aungels.  Þis towchynge and spekynge is gastly, &amp; nouȝt bodyly: ffor
qwen þe saule is lyfth &amp; rauysched out of þe sensualyte, &amp; out of þe mynde of
any erthely thyngis, þan in grete feruoure of lufe and lyȝth of god, if oure
lorde vouchesafe, þe saule may here &amp; fele heuenly sown, made be þe presence
of aungels in louynge of god.  Nouȝt þat þis songe of aungels es þe souerayne
Ioye of þe saule; bot for þe difference þat es atwyxe a mans saule in flesche
&amp; an aungell be-cause of vnclennes, a saule may nouȝt here it bot be rauyschynge
in lufe, [&amp;] nedyth for to be purified wele clene, and fulfilled of mykyl charite, or
it were abil for to here heuenly sown.  For þe souereyn &amp; þe essencial Ioye es in
[þe] lufe of god be hym-selfe &amp; for hym-selfe, and [þe] secundarie es in communynge
&amp; behaldynge of aungels &amp; gastily creaturis.  For ryȝt as a saule in vndyrstandynge of gastly thyngis is oftesythes towchyd &amp; kenned thorow bodili ymaginacion ... þe sothefastenes of goddis priuetys, ryȝt swa in þe lufe of god a saule be presence of aungels is rauyschyd out of mynde of alle erthely &amp; fleschely thynges in to an heuenly Ioye, to here aungelis songe and heuenly sowne, eftyr þe charite is
more or lesse.  Now þan thynke me þat þer may na saule fele verraly aungels
sange ne heuenly sowne, bot he be in parfyte charite.  And nouȝt-forthy, alle
<EPB/><PB N="1: 179"/>

þat be in parfyte charite ne has nouȝt felid it, bot anly þat saule þat is sa
purified in þe fyre of lufe, þat alle erthely sauoure is brent out of it, &amp; all mene
lettynge atwyxe þe saule &amp; þe clennes of aungels is broken &amp; putte away fra it.
Þan sothely may he synge a new songe, and sothely may he here a blyssefull
heuenly sowne &amp; aungels sange with-outyn deseyte or feynynge.  Oure lorde wat
qware þat saule is þat for habundance of brennande lufe is wurthy to here aungels
sange.  Qwa swa þan wylle here aungels sange, &amp; nouȝt be deseuyd be feynynge
ne ymagynacion of hym-selfe, ne be illusyon of þe ennemy, hym behoues for
to haue parfite charite, &amp; þat is qwen alle vayn lufe &amp; drede, vayne Ioye &amp; sorowe is castyn out of þe hert, þat he lufes na thynge ... bot in god or for god.
Qwa swa myȝt be grace of god go þis way, he sulde nouȝt erre.  Neuyr-þe-latter
some men ere desayued be þayr awen ymagynacion, or be illusyon of þe ennemy
in þis mater.  Some man qwen he has lange travalid bodili &amp; gastily in distroynge

&amp; a clerete in conscience, anon he leues prayers, redynges of haly wrytte, &amp; meditacions of þe passyon of Criste, &amp; þe mynde of hys wrecchednes, and or he
be called of god, he gedyrs hys wyttes be vyolence to seke &amp; to behald heuenly

ymagynacion[s] hys wyttes, and be vndiscrete travelynge turnes þe braynes in hys heued
&amp; forbrekes þe myȝtes &amp; þe wittes of þe saule &amp; of þe body: &amp; þan for febelnes of þe brayn hym thynke þat he heris wondyrfull sownes &amp; sanges; and þat is
<EPB/><PB N="1: 180"/>

na thynge ellis bot a fantasye caused of trobelynge of þe brayn — as a man
þat is in a fransy, hym thynke þat he heris &amp; sees þat nan oþir man does, and
al is bot vanite &amp; fantasy of þe heued.  Or ellis it is be wyrkynge of þe ennemy
þat feynes swylke sownes in hys heringe.  For if a man haue any presumpcion,
in hiis fantasiis &amp; in his wyrkynges, &amp; þerby fallis in to indiscrete ymagynacion,
as it were in a frenesy, &amp; is nouȝt kenned ne reuled of g[r]ace ne confortid be
gastly strenghe, þe deuel enters in be fals illumynacions &amp; fals sownes &amp; swetenes [&amp;] deceyues a mans soule.  An[d] of þis fals grounde sprynges errours &amp; heresyes, fals prophecies, presumcions &amp; fals r[o]seynges, blasphemes &amp; sclaunderyngs, &amp; many oþir myschefes.  And þarefor if þou see any man gastly occupyed falle in any of þis synnys &amp; þese deseytes, or in frenesis, wyte þou wele þat he neuyr herde ne felid aungels songes ne heuenly soune: for sothely he þat veraly heris aungels sange, h[e] ys made soe wyse þat he sal neuyr erre be fantasye ne be

in þayr hertis, as it ware a gastly sowne &amp; swete sangys, in diuerse maners, &amp; þis is comenly gude, &amp; sometyme it may turne to disceyte.  Þis soune is felid
on þis wyse: Some man settis þe thouȝthe of hys hert haly in þe name of Ihesu
&amp; stedfastly haldys it þerto, and þa[n] in schorte tyme hym thynke[s] þat name
turnys til hym to grete profete, conforte &amp; swetenes, and hym thynke þe name
sounes in hys herte delytably as it ware a sange, &amp; þe vertu of þis lykynge is
swa myȝtty þat it draws in alle wyttes of þe saule þerto.  Qwo-so may fele

<EPB/><PB N="1: 181"/>

and as longe as he is meke he sal nouȝt be disceyued.  Bot þis is nouȝt aungels
songe, bot it is a sange of þe saule be vertu of þe name, &amp; be towchynge of
þe gude aungell.  For qwen a saule offers hyr to Ihesu trewly, &amp; mekely puttis
alle hyr trayste and hyr desyre in hym, &amp; besyly kepes hym in hyre mynde, oure
lorde Ihesu, qwen he wyll, purges þe affeccion of þe saule, &amp; fyllys it &amp; fedys
it with swetenes of hym-selfe, &amp; makes hys name in þe felynge of þe saule as
hony, &amp; as sange, &amp; as any thynge þat is delitabil: þat it lykes þe saule euyrmore for to crye Ihesu, Ihesu; and nouȝt only he has confort in þis, bot also in
psalmys &amp; ympnes &amp; antympnes of haly kyrke, þat þe hert synges þem swetly,
deuotly &amp; frely, with-outyn any travayle of þe saule or bitternes, in þe same toune
&amp; notes þat haly kyrke vses.  Þis is gude &amp; of þe gyfte of god, ffor þe
substaunce of þis felynge lys in þe lufe of Ihesu qwilke is fed &amp; lyȝttynd be swylke maner of sanges.  Neuyr-þe-latter in þis maner felynge a saule may be desceyved

in swetenes of hym, bot eftyrwarde, qwen it sesses, &amp; þe hert kelys of lufe of Ihesu,
þan entyris-in vayn-glorye.  Also some man is desceyued on þis wyse: He heris
wel say þat it is gude till haue Ihesu in hys mynde, or any oþir gude worde of

nerehande alway in hys mynde.  Nouȝt-forthy he felis nouȝthyr þerby in hys
affeccion swetenes, ne lyȝt of knowyng in hys resone, bot only a nakyd mynde
of god, or of Ihesu, or of Marie, or of any oþir gude worde.  Here may be
desceyte, not for it is ille for to haue Ihesu in mynde on þis wyse, bot if he

þat a nakyd mynde or a nakyd ymagynacion of Ihesu or of any gastly thynge,

to þe als me thynke. / When a saule es puryfyede by þe lufe of godde, Illumynede
by wysedome, stabled by myghte of godde, than es þe eghe of þe saule opyned
to be-halde gastely thynges, as vertus, aungells and haly saules, and heuenly
thynges.  Thane es þe saule abill by cause of clennes to fele þe toucheynge, þe
spekynge of gude aungells.  This touchyng and spekynge es gastely, noghte bodyly:
ffor whene þe saule es lyftede and raysede owte of the sensualyte, and owte of

if oure lorde vouche-safe, þe saule may here &amp; fele heuenly sownne, made by

false prophesyes, presumpcyons and false rusyn¯gs, blasfemyes and sclandirynges, and
many oþer myschefes.  And þare-fore if þou se any mane gastely ocupiede ffalle

als lange als he es meke he sall noghte be dissayuede.  Bot þis es noghte aungels

þe gude aungelle.  For when a saule offirs it to Ihesu trewly &amp; mekely, puttande all
his traiste and his desyre in hym, and besily kepis [hym] in his mynde, oure lorde
Ihesu, whene he will, puris þe affeccioune of þe saule, &amp; fillis it &amp; fedis it with
swetnes of hym-selfe, and makes his name in þe felynge of þe saule as hony,
and as sange, and as any thynge þat es delitabill: so þat it lykes þe saule
euermare for to cry Ihesu Ihesu; and noghte anely he hase comforthe in this, bot also

lufe hym of whaym all þi fairenes commes; and þou sall lufe gastely ilk a mane,

if þou conabilly thynke of gudes þat he has done gudly for þe, and mare sall

þou was peryschede he soghte þe, and whene þou was saulde with syne þan he

was borne in syne he baptyȝede þe; and sythene aftirwarde whene þou synnede
sa foully and sa ofte, þan he sufferde þe so frely and habade thynne
amendemente sa lange, and sythene rescheyuede þe sa swetly, and þe has sett in sa
swete a falachipe.  And ilke a day when þou mysdose þan he reprofes þe, and
whene þou repentis þe þan he forgyffes the, and when þou erris þan he amendis
þe, and when þou dredis þe þan he leris þe, and whene þou hungers þan he
fedis þe, and when þou erte calde þane he warmes þe, and whene þou has hete
þan he kelis þe, and when þou slepis þan he saues þe, and whene þou ryseȝ

comforthes þe.  [V.] Thyre gudnes and many oþer hase done vn-to þe thi swete spouse
Ihesu Criste.  And þe swettnes of his herte sall þou thynke euer-mare and euer
speke þare-of, and euer-mare lofe hym, and euer thanke hym, and þat bath

sodanly with-owttyne sacramentis and fallyne in-till dampnacione ay-lastande.
Thynk alswa how many thowsande þat nyghte are [fallyn] in perill of saule, þat
es to say in dedly syne, als in glotony, lechery, Couetyse, in manes-slaynge and in
many oþer folyes.  And of all þise illes the has delyuered thy swete lorde Ihesu,
with-owttene þi deserte.  What seruyce hase þou done wharefore he hase

My dere frende, if þou hafe þis manere, þan sall þou hafe verray knaweynge of

þou sall be gyffene».  And this maner of consederasyone es callede medytacyone,
[and] by þis maner of knawynge of þi-selfe &amp; by þis maner of medytacyone sall
þou come to þe knaweynge of gode by haly contemplacyone.  [VI.] Wiet þou þat
þare es thre manere of contemplacyone: The fyrste es in creaturs.  The toþer
es in haly scripture.  The thirde es in gode hyme-selfe in his nature.  Thow
sall wyet þat contemplacyone es na noþer thynge bot thoghte of godde in gret
lykynge in saule, and to se his gudnes in his creaturs.  His gudnes in his creaturs
may þou see one þis manere.  Thre thynges pryncypaly ere in gode, þat es to
say Myghte, Wysdome, and Gudnes.  Mighte es appropirde to godd þe ffadire,
Wysdome to god þe Son¯, Gudnes to god þe Haly gaste.  Thurgh goddes myghte

þaire fairenes [&amp;] þaire ordaynynge, his gudnes may þou see by þaire Encressynge.
<EPB/><PB N="1: 223"/>

Þaire gretnes may þou see by þaire foure partynges, þat es to saye by þaire
heghte and by þaire depnes and by þaire largenes and by þaire lenghe.  His
wysdome may þou see if þou take kepe how he hase gyffene to ylke a creature
to be.  Somme, he hase gyffene to be anely with-owttene mare, als vn-to stanes.
Till oþer, to be &amp; to lyffe, als to grysse and trees.  Till oþer, to be, to lyffe,
to fele, als to bestes.  Till oþer, to be, to lyffe, to fele and with resone to
deme, als to mane and to angells.  For stanes erre, bot þay ne hafe noȝte
lyffe ne felys noghte ne demes noghte.  Trees are, [&amp;] þay lyffe, bot þay fele
noghte ...  Mene are, þay lyffe, þay fele and þay deme, and þay erre with
stanes, þay lyffe with trees, þay fele with bestes, and demys with angells.
Here sall þou thynke besyly þe worthynes of manes kynde, how it ouer-passes
ilke a creature.  And þare-fore saise saynt Austyne: «I wald noghte hafe þe stede
of ane angelle if I myghte hafe þe stede þat es purvayede to mane».  Thynk also
þat mane es worthy gret schenschipe þat will noghte lyffe eftyre hys degre and
eftire his condicyone askis.  For all þe creaturs in þe worlde ere made anely for
mane.  Þase þat ere meke, ere made for thre skylles: ffor to helpe vs at trauayle,
als nate, oxene, kye, and horse; ffor to couer vs &amp; clethe vs, als lyne and wolle
and lethire; ffor to fede vs and vphalde vs, als bestes, Corne of þe erthe, ffysche
of þe see.  And þe noyande creaturs, als ill trees and venemous bestes; þe wylke
are made for thre thynges: ffor oure chastyyng, for oure amendement, and for
oure kennynge.  We ere chastied and puneschet when we ere hurte.  And þat
es gret mercy of godde þat he will chasty vs bodyly þat we be noghte punescht
lastandly.  We erre amendid when we thynke þat all þese ere broghte vs for

one oure wrechidnes, and þane we ere mekyde.  We ere Eftirwarde kende, for-þi
þat we see in þise creaturs þe wondirfull werkes of god oure makere; ffor mare

of haly writte?»  Now, my dere frende, vndirstande me swetely and I sall say
perchance to þe: all þat es wretene [may be tald].  If þou kane noghte vndirstand haly
writt, here gladly þe gud þat mene saise þe; and whene þou heres haly wryte owþer
in sermone or in preue collacyone, take kepe als-tyte if þou here oghte þat may

sall doo and whate þou sall lefe, and all þat lyghtes þinne vndyrstandynge in
knawynge of sothefastnes, and all þat kyndills þi lykynge in brynnynge of charite;
ffor of þise twa gudnes es all þat es wretyne in preue or in apperte.  Owte of
haly writte sall þou drawe and cune witte whilke are þe seuene dedly synnes,
and þe seuene vertus, and þe ten comandementis, and þe tuelfe artycles of þe
trouthe, and þe seuene sacramentis of haly kyrke, and þe seuene gyftis of þe
haly gaste, and þe seuene werkes of mercy, and þe seuene vertuȝ of þe gospell,
and þe seuen prayers of þe <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">pater noster</FOREIGN>.</P><LB/><P>[VIII.] Þir are þe seuene dedly synnes: Pryde, and Envy, Ire, Slouth, Couetyse,
Glotony, and Lechery.  Pryde es lufe of vnkyndly heghynge, and þar-of comes
þir seuen: Vnbouxomnes agayne god or agayne souerayngne, þat es to say, to
lefe þat þat es commandyd and to do þat that es defendyde.  The toþer branch
of pride es Surquytry, þat es, to vndirtake thyng ouer his powere, or wenys to
be mare wyse þan he es, or better þan he es; and auaunteȝ hym of gude þat he
hase of oþer, or of ill þat he hase of hym-selfe.  The thrid braunche of pride
es Ypocrisye, þat es whene he feynys hym to hafe gudnes þat he hase noghte,
and hydes þe wykkednes þat he hase.  The ferth braunch of pride es Despyte of
thyne euencristene, þat es when man lesses gudnes of oþer, for-thi þat hym-selfe
suld seme þe bettir.  The fyfte braunche [es Arrogance], þat es when man makes
lyknes betwyx his awene wykkednes and oþer mens wikkednes, þat his awene
may seme þe lesse.  The sexte braunche of pryde es Vnschamefulnes, þat es
when men hase noghte schame of ill ded aperte.  The seuen[d]e braunche of pryde
es Elacione, þat es when a man hase heghe herte, þat he will noȝte suffire to
felawe ne mayster.  Dere frende, þou sall wit þat thre thynges ere whare-of a man
Enprides hym, þat es to say: of þe gudeȝ þat he hase of kynde, als fairenes or
strenghe or gude witte or nobille kynredyne.  The toþer thyng es þat man
hase of purchase, als cunnynge, grace, gud loos, or dygnyte or office.  The thirde
thynge es erthely thynge or erthely gude, als clethynge, houssynge, Renteȝ,
possessione, Menȝe, horssyng, and honour of þis worlde.  Pride makes man to
be of gret herte and heghe, to despyse his euencristene, and to ȝerne heghenes
and maystry ouer oþer.  ¶ The toþer dedly syne es Envy.  And þat es Ioye of oþer
mens harme, and sorowe of oþer mens welefare.  And þat may be in herte with
lykynge, or in mouth with bakbyttynge, or in werke with of mens gudnes
wyth-drawyng or ells with ill procurynge.  Envye mase man to hafe þe herte hevy of
þat he sese oþer men mare worthi þan he in any thyng.  ¶ The third dedly syne
es Wrethe, þat es ane vnresonabyll temperoure of herte; and of it comes stryfes
and contekes, schamefull and dyuerse wordes and denyouse, and wikked sclandirs.
¶ The ferthe dedly syne es Slouthe, and þat mase manes herte hevy and slawe
<EPB/><PB N="1: 225"/>

in gude dede, and makes mane to yrke in prayere or halynes, and puttes man in
wykkednes of wanhope, for it slokyns þe lykyngeȝ of gastely lufe.  ¶ The fyfte
dedly syne es Couetyse, and þat es ane vnmesurabill luffe to hafe erthely gudes,
and it destroyes &amp; blyndes manes herte.  And þare-of commes tresones, ffalse
athes, wykked reste, Malice and hardnes of herte agaynes mercy.  ¶ The sexte
dedly syne es Glotony, and þat makes mane to serue and to be bouxome till
wykked lykynges of þe flesche, þe whilke man suld maister and ouercome with
mesure.  Of glotony commes vayne Ioy, lyghtnes, and littill vndirstandynge.  ¶ The
seuen[d]e dedly syne es Lecherye, and þat mase manes herte to melte, and to playe
thare þare his herte lykes and heldes, and þat with-owtene gouernynge of
resoune.  Of lechery commes blyndynge of herte, In prayere vnstabilnes, and
fulle-hastynes, lufe of hym-selfe, hatredene of godde, lufe of þis worlde, vgglynes
and whanhope of þe blysse of heuene.  ¶ Dere frende, thire are þe seuene dedly
synnes; and wele ere þay callid dedly synnes, ffor Pride twynnes fra man his
godde, Envy his euencristene, Ire hym-selfe twynnes, Slouthe hym tourmentes,
Couetyse hym begyles, Glotony hym dessayues, and Lecherye hym in thraledome
settis....  [X.] Nowe hase þou herde þe seuene sekenes of manes saule.  ¶ Sythene
aftirwarde commes þe souerayne leche and takes þere medcynes, and waresche
mane of þese seuene seknes and stabills hym in þe seuene vertueȝ, thurgh þe
gyftes of þe haly gaste.  Þe whilke are þese: ¶ Þe gaste of wysdom and
vndirstandynge, þe gaste of consaile and of stalworthenes, þe gaste of cunnynge and
of pete, and þe gaste of drede of godde Almyghty.  Thurghe þese gyftes oure
lord Ihesu lerres mane all þat he hase myster [of] till þe lyfe þat es callid actyfe,
and til þe lyfe called contemplatyfe.  And se how; firste mane suld lefe þe euyll
and do þe gude; lefe þe euyll, þat teches vs þe gaste of drede of godde
almyghty, and do þe gude leres vs þe gaste of pete.  And for-þi þat twa thynges
are þat lettis vs to do gude, þat es at saye welefare and tribulacione of þis
worlde, ffor welefare desayues vs with losengery, tribulacyone with hardnes of
noyes &amp; dysses: for-þi sall þou despyse þe welefare of þis worlde þat þou be
noghte þer-with dessayuede, and þat leres þe þe gaste of cunnynge; and þou
sall stallworthly suffire tribulacyone þat þou be noghte ouercommene, and þat
teches vs þe gaste of stallworthenes.  And þire foure suffice till þe lyfe þat es
callid actyfe.  And þe toþer thre fallys to þe lyfe þat es callid contemplatyfe;
ffor thre maners [are] of contemplacione.  Ane es in creaturs, and þat leres þe gaste
of vndyrstandynge.  The toþer es in haly writte whare þou sese whatte þou [sal]
doo &amp; what þou sall lefe, and þat leres þe the gaste of consaile.  The thirde
manere es in godde hym-selfe, and þat leres vs þe gaste of wysdome.  Now þou
sese thurgh þe gyftes of Ihesu how he es besy abowte oure hele.  [XI.] Eftire þis
sall þou wiete whilke ere þe tene comandementis.  ¶ Þe firste comandement es
þis: «Thow sall wirchip¯e bot a godde þi lorde, and till hym anely þou sall
serue».  Þat es at say: wyrchipe hym with righte trouthe, serue vn-till [hym] anely
with gude werkes.  Here sall þou thynke if þou hafe lelly serued godde &amp; wirchiped
godde; if þou hafe seruede hym ouer all thynge; if þou hafe ȝolden hym þat
that þou hyghte, if þou hafe done le[l]e penance, and if þou hafe ȝoldyne
hym þat that þou hyghte hym in þi cristyndome, that was, to forsake þe deuelle
<EPB/><PB N="1: 226"/>

and all his werkes and in god lelly to trowe.  And thurghe þis commandement
es mane ordaynede ynence god þe ffadire.  ¶ [In] þe toþer commandement es
defendide to take goddes name in vayne; and lying and falsenes þare-in es defendide;
and thurghe þis commandement es man ordaynede ynence godde þe Sone, þat
saise hym-selfe «I am sothefastnes».  ¶ Þe thirde commandemente es, «vmbythynke þe þat þou kepe þi haly-dayes», þat es to saye, in þine awene herte to kepe þe in riste and pees, with-owttene seruage of syne or of bodyly dedis.  And þis commandement ordaynes mane to reschayfe þe Haly gaste.  Þise thre
commandementes lerres mane how-gates he sall hafe hym ynence godde þe trynite, to
whas lyknes he es made in saule. / Þe oþer seuene commandementes leres man
how he sall hafe hym ynence his euencristene.  ¶ Þe firste es: «Þou sall honour þi fadire and þi modire» fleschely and gastely, and þat in twa maners, þat es to say, þat þou be bouxom to thaym in reuerence and honour, and [þat] þou helpe þame at thy powere in all thyngeȝ þat þay hafe myster [of].  «Þat þou be of lange lyfe in erthe»; ffor if þou will be of lange lyfe, it es resone þat þou honoure thayme of whaym þou hase þe lyfe; ffor he þat will noghte honoure hym thurgh whaym he es, it es noghte righte þat he be mare þa[t] he es.  ¶ Þe toþer commandement es þis: «Þou sall sla na man».  Here sall þou wyt þat slaughter es of many maneres: ffor þer es manes-slaghter of hand, of tunge, of herte.  Mannes-slaynge of hande es when a mane slaes anoþer with his handeȝ, or when he duse hym in bandis of dede, als in presone, or in oþer stede þat may be enchesone of his
dede.  Manes-slaynge of tunge es in twa maneres, thurghe commandement or
thurghe enticement.  Manes-slayng of herte es alswa one twa maners, þat es,
whene mene ȝernys and couaytes ded of oþer, and when he suffyrs man to dy and
will noghte delyuer hym if he hafe powere.  ¶ Þe thirde commandement es þis:
«Þou sall do na lechery»; and þat es ryghte; wha-sa will hafe þe lyfe with-owttene corupcyone in þe Ioy of heuene, hym byhoues kepe his lyfe þat es dedly
with-owttene corupcione of body.  ¶ Þe ferthe commandement es þis: «Þou sall do na thyfte ne na falsenes»; and þat es ryghte, ffor he þat will safe oþer menes lyfe he sall noghte do away þat that moghte his lyfe sustayne.  ¶ Þe fyfte
commandement es þis: «Þou sall noghte bere false wittnes agaynes thyne euen-cristyne» with hym þat will noye hym or sla hym; and þat es ryghte, ffor he þat will noghte sckathe his euencristyne he sall noghte consente ne na consaile gyffe to do hym ill.  ¶ Þe sexte commandement and þe seuende er þir: «Þou sall noghte couaite þi neghtboure wyfe», «ne þou sall noghte couaite his house ne nane of his gude wrangwysly»; ffor he þat hase wykked will and ill Entente in his herte, he may noghte lang with-hald hym fra wykkide dede; and þerfore if þou will noghte do lecherye þou sall noghte consente to mane ne to womane þat it duse, and if þou
will noghte stele þou sall noghte couayte oþer mennes thynges in þi herte.  Dere
frende, þir are þe ten commandementes þat god gafe till Moyses in the mounte
of Synay.  The thre fyrste er pertenande to þe lufe of god, and the toþer seuene
to þe lufe of þi-selfe and of thynne euene-crystyne.  [XII.] Now, efter, sall þou wyt

lyfe þat [þay] sall lede till þe Ioye of heuene.  Dere frende, the awe to wyte þat
we ere all made for ane ende, þat es to say, for to knawe godde, to hafe hym,
and to lufe hym.  Bot thre thynges er nedefull at puruaye till oure cu[m]ynge [to
gud ende], that es, to wyte whedyr we sall ga, and þat we wyll comme thedyre,
and þat we hafe trayste to com thedyre; ffor grete foly ware it to begyne þe

doo, hym nedide to hafe wysdome, myghte, and will, þat es to say, þat he konne
[wele] doo, and þat he may doo, and þat he wyll doo.  Bot for-þi þat we hafe
noghte cunnynge, myghte, ne will of oure-selfe, for-þi hase godde gyfene vs trouthe
for to fulfill þe defaute of oure [cunnynge; trayste, for to fulfill þe defaute of oure]
myghte; sothefaste lufe, for to ordayne oure will to þe tane and to þe toþer.
Trouthe ordaynes vs to godde þe Sone to whayme es appropyrde Wysdome, Trayste
till godde þe ffadyre to whaym es appropyrde myghte, Lufe to þe Haly gaste till
whayme es appropyrde gudnes.  And þare-[fore] trouthe makes vs to hafe knawynge
[of god]; and þat knaweynge vs sayse þat he es wondyrfull ffre es he þat one þis
manere and þus largely gyffes of his gudnes, and of þat comes trayste; and [of] þat
knawynge þat sais þat he es gude, commes þe thyrde sothefastnes, þat es lufe,
ffor ylke a thynge luffes kyndely þe gude.  [XIII.] Dere frende, here sall þou wyte
whilke are þe twelue artycles of þe trouthe.  ¶ The firste es þis: þat godde es ane in hym-selfe and thre in person¯s, with-owttene begynnynge and with-owttene
Endynge, and þat all thynges made of noghte with his worde.  ¶ Þe toþer artecle
es, þat goddes sone tuke flesche and blode of þe blyssed maydene Marie and was
borne of hire sothefaste godde and sothefaste mane.  ¶ Þe thirde es, þat he was
dede and grauene, noghte for nede, bot for to by vs of his fre will.  ¶ The ferthe
artecle es, þat þe same Ihesu rase fra dede to lyfe, and we sall ryse alswa.  ¶ The
fyfte artecle es, þat þe same sothefaste god and mane steighe vp in till heuene in
manhed and godhede, and we sall steighe vp alswa thurgh his grace.  [XIV.] ¶ Þe
sext artecle es Baptyme, þat mase mane clene of syne þat he drawes of kynde,
and gyffes grace to clense.  ¶ The seuende artecle es Confirmacione, þat confermys
þe haly gaste one mane þat es cristenede.  ¶ Þe aughtened artecle es Penance,
þat duse awaye all maner of syne, dedly and venyall.  ¶ Þe nynde es þe sacrament
of þe Auter, þat confermys þe penante, and gyffes hym force þat he fall noghte
efte in syne, and vphaldes hyme and reconsailles hym.  ¶ Þe tende artecle es
Ordyre, þat gyffes powere till þayme þat are ordeynede to do þaire Offece and
to do þe sacramentis.  ¶ Þe elleuende artecle es Matrimone, þat defendis dedly
syne in werke of generacyone by-twyx mane and womane.  ¶ Þe twelfed artecle
es Enoyntynge, þat mene Enoyntes þe seke in perell of dede, for alegeance of
body and saule.  [XV.] Dere frende, aftyre sall þou wyt whilke are þe foure vertus
cardynalles, thurgh whilke all manes lyfe es gouernede in þis worlde, Þat es ¶
Cunnynge and Rightwisnes, Force and Mesure.  Of þir foure saise þe haly gaste in
þe buke of Wysdome þat þare es na thynge mare profytabill till man in erthe.  And
se nowe, whare-fore.  Wha-sa walde any thynge wele do, firste hyme byhouys þat he
konne chese þe ill fra þe gude, and of twa gud chese þe bettire: &amp; þis vertu es called

cunnynge.  Siþen þou sal lefe þe ill &amp; do þe gude, &amp; do þe greter gude] and leffe þe lesse gude: and þis es the vertu þat es callede ryghtwysnes.  And for-þi þat
twa thynges lettes mane to do wele and lefe þe yll, þat es at say welefare of
þis worlde, for it dessayfes hyme with false vanytes, þe toþer es tribulacyone, to
putt hym downe with many scharpnes: agaynes welefare sall þou hafe mesure þat
þoue be noghte ouer-hye: and þis vertu es called temperance.  And agayne
aduersyte sall þou hafe hardynes þat þou be noghte castene downne: and þat
vertue es callyde fforce or strenghe.  [XVI.] ¶ Here-eftyre sall þou wyte whylke
are þe seuene werkes of mercy.  ¶ The firste werke of Mercy es, to gyffe mete
to þe hunngry.  The toþer es to gyffe drynke to þe thrysty.  The thirde es to
clethe þe nakede.  Þe ferthe es to herbere þe herberles.  Þe fyfte es to vesete
þam¯e þat ere in presoune.  The sexte es to comforth þe seke.  The seuende
[es] to bery þe dede.  Thyse are þe seuene werkes of mercy þat are langande to
þe body.  Bot nowe may þou say to me: «how sulde I þat es in Relygyone, and
noghte hase to gyffe at ete ne at drynke, ne clathes to þe nakede, ne herbery to
þe herberles, ffor I am at oþer mens will and noghte at myne awene?  ffor-thi
ware it better þat I ware seculere, þat I myghte do þire werkes of mercy».  / A,
dere frende, be noghte begylede.  Better it es to hafe pete and compassione in
þi herte of hym þat hase mysese and wrechednes, thane þou hade all þis worlde
to gyffe for charyte; ffor it es bettir wyth compassione to gyffe þi-selfe, als þou
erte, þan it es to gyffe þat that þou hase.  There-fore, dere frende, gyffe thi-selfe,
and þan gyffes þou mare þan es in all þis worlde.  Bot now may þou say me
one þis manere: «Sothe it es þat it es better to gyffe hyme-selfe þan it es to
gyffe of his: bot better es þe tane and þe toþer þan es ane be it-selfe, for lesse
es a gud þan twa».  It es noghte swa; ffor whethire es better be callede godde,
or his seruande?  Thow wate wele þat [it] es better to be callede godde.  Bot þase
þat suffirs hunngere, thryste, caulde and defaute, and oþer wrechidnes and
mysese, calles oure lorde Ihesu Criste «hym-selfe», ffor he saise þus in þe gosepelle: «What als þou dyde to þe leste of myne, þou did to me»...  Saynt Barnarde says: «Thire pure hase noghte in erthe, ne thire riche hase noghte in heuene»; and þare-fore if þe Riche will it hafe, thaym byhoues bye it at þe pure.  / Now wate I wele þou couaytes to wyte whilke are verray pure, and whilke noghte.  Now herkene with deuocyone.  Sume are þat hase reches and lufes thaym, and þase are þe haldande &amp; þe couaytourse of þis worlde.  Othere are þat hase þame noghte bot thay luffe thayme, and þay walde hafe thayme gladly, and þase are þe wrechide beggers of þe worlde, and þe false folke in religyone, and þase are als riche and richere þane
þe oþer [in will].  And of thame Ihesu saise in þe gospelle þat «lyghtere it ware a camelle to passe thurghe a nedill eghe, þan þe riche to come in to þe blysse of
heuene».  Sume are þat hase reches bot thay lufe thaym noghte, noghte-for-thy þay
will wele hafe þame: and þase are þe gud mene of þe worlde þat dispendis wele
that at þay hase.  Bot fone are of þase!  Ȝit are oþer þat hase noghte reches,
ne lufes noghte thaym, ne will noght hafe þame: and þase are þe gude folke þat
are in religione, and þase are sothefastely pure, and þairs es þe Ioye of heuene,
ffor þat es the benysone of þe pure.  Than it behufes þat þe riche hafe þe
reuer[s]e of þat benysone; and þare-fore may I say «Blyssede be þe pouer for þaires es þe kyngdome and þe Ioye of heuene».  And swa may I say of þe riche for
<EPB/><PB N="1: 229"/>

þairs es pyne of helle.  Alswa pouer þay are þat hase pouerte and lufes na
reches, and pouer þay are þat hase reches and lufes pouert.  [XVII.] Now aftire
þis, awe þe to wyte whylke are þe seuene prayers of þe <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Pater noster</FOREIGN>, þat duse away all ill and purchase all gude.  And þase seuene prayers er contende in þe
<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Pater noster</FOREIGN> þe whilke oure lorde Ihesu Criste kennde till his discyples how þay
[suld] pray godde þe ffadire, and sayd thaym one þis manere: «Whene ȝe sall

And þare-fore I walde at þou wyste at þe begynnynge whate es
prayere or orysone, and sythyne þat þou vndirstande þe prayere of þe <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Pater noster</FOREIGN>.  / Prayere or Orysone es noghte elles bot ȝernyng of saule, with certayne
trayste þat it commes þat þou prayes.  And in þat trayste vs settis Ihesu Criste
whene he kennes vs to calle godde «oure fadyre þat es in heuene»; ffor in hym
sall man hafe certayne trayste þat he may and will all gudnes gyffe þat oure
saule kane ȝerne and mekill mare, þe whilke es betakynde by þise wordes: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Qui es in celis,</FOREIGN> þat es to say «þe whilke es in heuene»; ffor if godde will call
hym-selfe oure fadyre, þan he makes vs to wiet þat he lufes vs als childyre, and at
he will gyffe vs all þat we hafe myster of.  Bot certanly, if all þe lufe þat euer

gedirde to-gedyre in a lufe, and ȝit þat lufe ware multipliede als mekill als manes

thurgh þe grace of godde, If we se one what manere he es oure ffadyr and
whatt he hase done for vs.  Wit þou þat whene god made all creaturs of noghte,
we rede noghte þat he made any creature till his lyknes bot mane allane; and
þare-fore godd he es, and makere of all thynges of þe worlde, bot he es noghte
þaire fadyre; bot vn-till vs, thurghe his awene myghte full of mercy, es he godde
and makere and ffadyr, ffor þat oure saule es lelly lyke vn-till þe lyknes of þe
ffadyr, and þe sone, and þe haly gaste, þat ere hallyly a godde and persons thre.
And all þis werlde he hase made to serue man, whils mane will duelle in his lele
lufe als his awene childyre.  Bot als-tyte als we twyne fra þat lele lufe, for lufe
of þis lyfe, or for any oþer thynge, we losse þe lordechipe of þis worlde, and
becommes thralles dreryly to þe deuelle, þare we ware before fre, and ayers of
þe erytage of þe kyngdome of heuene and to welde þe welthe of þis werlde.
Allas [I] may saye, Allas, allas, what here es a sorowfull chaunge, wha-sa it
vndyrstode!  Wit þou wele þat here es gret lykynge of lufe,—when godd þat es
with-owttyne begynnynge and es with-owttene chaungeyng and duellys with-owttyne

grace þat oure lorde hase done till vs by-fore all oþer creaturs.  And ȝitt did
he mare thurghe his mekill mercy.  For whene we ware thurghe oure sorowfull
syne twynnede fra godde oure sweteste ffadire, and become thralles to þe ill
gaste, than he, thurghe hys maste mercy, sente his awene sonne, þat with hym es
godde in his godhede, for to take flesche and blode of þe virgyne Marie, Maydene
and modyr, lastand in Ioy; and one þis manere did he þe dede: In state of
thralle tuke he oure flesche to suffre þe gylteste pouerte and schame and noyes
and paynnes þat neuer dyd ill ne na maner of syne, and sythene delyuerde hym
till þe vileste dede and þe schamefulleste þat man moghte thynke, to delyuer vs
wreches of sorowfull bandis, and of þe pynand presone puttid in hell, and to
make vs to comme till þe heghe heuene, whare we sall be als kynges corounde
in blyse, if we do þe will of þat swet lorde þat for vs ordeynede hym to dye

þou here twa thyngeȝ in þe whylke godde hase schewede vs þat he es oure
fadire and þat he lufes vs als his awene childyre, þare we are agayne hyme with
oure wykked syne.  The firste es þat he made vs till his awene lyknes, and þe
toþer es þat he boghte vs fra presoune with his precyouse dede of his manhede.
For þe fyrste es man haldene till hym for to lufe hym with all his herte.  Bot
þan may þou aske: «What sall I do hym for þe toþer thynge?  ffor if I sall with
pouerhede lofe godde þe ffadyr and lufe hym and serue hym with all my saule and
with all my herte in all thynges for-þi þat he made me of noghte and gafe me
saule aftir his awene lyknes, als it was commandyd in þe alde lawe be-fore godde

wrechid synnere sa mekill hym lawede þat he walde becomme mane, and he gafe
hym to me whene he thurghe his sweteste mercy walde dye for me, and of þe
maste noyouse and þe maste vile dede þat euer was thoghte?  I wate neuer
what I may say here, ffor if I myghte lyffe a hundrethe ȝere, and if I moghte in
þat tym ilk a day at a tyme dye als vile ded als he for me dide, ȝit ne ware it
noghte ynence his gret gyfte, when he es sothely said goddes sonne of heuene,
and gafe hym-selfe till vs þat tynte was thurgh syne and put in to þe pyne of

þane ȝelde hym þe gude gret gyfte whene he walde sende his awene sone to be
pynede for oure syne?»  Now I sall lere the, if god gyffe me grace, how oure
dere ffadir askes nane oþer store bot that we with herte knawe oure awene
ffebillnes and oure wrechidnes þat we hafe for oure awene syne.  Thane sall we
be in bitternes of penance, and crye till hym faste mercy, þat he vs saue for
his haly name, ffor of oure-selfe hafe we noghte hym for to ȝelde.  Þare-fore said
the prophete in þe psalme: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Quid retribuam domino pro omnibus que retribuit michi?
Calicem salutaris accipiam et nomen domini invocabo &amp;c.,</FOREIGN> þat es: «What sall I ȝelde to god for all his gud gyftes þat he me gyffes als lorde with-owttene my deserte?
The coppe of hele I sall take and calle þe name of my lorde».  The cope of
hele whare-of dranke oure lord Ihesu oure saueour, þat es the bytternes of þe
penance in his grete pynes; and þat man in all his thoghteȝ calles godeȝ name,

And wit thow þat if sothefastenes be sett faste in thi saule, þe mare þat þou
knawes þe for wrechide and febyll, þe mare sall þou meke þe and calle one hys

mare of grace þane any in this lyfe man or womane þat euer was borne,
tharefore scho helde hir lesse and lawere þan any oþer wyghte, and mare cryede
scho mercy þan any oþer man, whene sothefaste goddes sone lighte in hir

þat þou may þis thynge thurghe þe grace of godd clerelyere see, gyffe gude

als mekill als þe saule es mare nobyll þan þe flesche, and in als mekill als godde
oure fadir of heuene es mare nobill and mare for to lufe þan oure fleschly fadir.
And þat suld we do if we saghe als clerely with oure gastely eghe, als we do

thus hase blyndid vs!  Certis na thynge mare blyndis manes saule þane lufe of

ffor whate-sa-euer we hafe in body or in saule of gudnes or of fairenes, we hafe it
of oure fadyr of heuene, godde, þat es till vs fadir, and Euenly till all his creaturs;
noghte anely for his makynge of noghte, ne for his gouernyng of his grace, for

In worthynes, for þat god hym-selfe mad it; and for-thi do þay gret schame and gret vnreuerence till Ihesu goddes sone þat takes þame till wordis ry[m]and and curius, and leues þe prayere þat he vs kennede, þat wate all þe will of godde þe ffadire, and þe whilke orysone commes mare till his plesynge, and whate thynges þe wrechede caytyfe hase myster at pray fore.
Alswa, als I hafe sayde, he wate anely all þe ffadir wyll, and he wate all oure

perfitely whyls we ere in þis caytifede worlde, þare-fore pray we þus and sayse
<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Adueniat regnum tuum</FOREIGN>, þat es to say, «it come till vs þi kyngdome, þat we regne
in þe, Ihesu, in þis lyfe thurgh thi grace, and þou in vs in þe toþer lyfe thurgh

neuer-mare may hafe parte with Ioye of heuene if we do noghte thi will in erthe,
þare-fore we praye thus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Fiat voluntas tua sicut in celo et in terra,</FOREIGN> þat es to say, «thi will be donne als in heuene swa in erthe»; als wa say, make vs to do þi wyll, þat es to say, þou gyffe vs grace to do all þat þou commandes, and to lefe all þat þou defendis; and þat swa in erthe als in heuene, þat es to say, als Michaelle and Gabrielle and Raphaelle, Cherubyne and Seraphyne, and all þe oþer angells and archangells, ... and all þase þat are Ordeynede to þe endles lyfe in Ioy in ilke a

we may noghte do þi will whills we lyffe in þis body if þou ne sustayne vs

And here es for to wit þat þare es thre maners of brede: þa[re] es bodyly brede, þat es to say ffode and clethynge, þare es brede gastely, þat es to say of haly wrytte þe leryng; and þare es þe brede of Eukaryste, þat es þe grace in þe sacrament of þe autere, for to comforthe þe kynde of þe tane and þe toþer.  Bot for-thi þat we ere worthi na gudnes whills we ere bowndene in synne, þare-fore say we þus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris,</FOREIGN> þis es to say, «fforgyffe vs oure dettis als we forgyffe oure dettours».  Þou sall wyt þare oure synns byndis oure dettours to pynne, þare-fore we pray Ihesu to forgyff vs synnes, þat es to say, all þat we hafe synnede in thoghte in worde and in dede; and þat ryghte als we for-gyffe till þase þat hase mysdone agaynes vs.  And for-þi þat a lyttill vs helpes to hafe forgyfnes of syne, if we may noghte kepe vs fra syne,
þare-fore pray we þus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Et ne nos inducas in temptacionem,</FOREIGN> and þis es to say, «lede vs noȝte in to na fandyngis»; als-wa say, suffere vs noghte be ouer-commene in fandyngeȝ of þe deuell ne of þe flesch ne of þe werlde.  And noghte allanly we pray þat we be delyuered of all euyll fandyngeȝ, bot alswa we pray þat we be delyuered of all ill thynge, whene we say <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Set libera nos a malo,</FOREIGN> and þis es to say, «Bot delyuer vs of all ill thyngis», þat es, of body and of saule, of syne and of

And for-thi sayse oure lorde Ihesu Criste in þe gospelle: «what-sa þou prayes my fadir in my name he sall do it», and þer-fore say at þe Ende <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Per dominum nostrum Iesum Christum filium tuum &amp;c.</FOREIGN>  And now, my dere frende, vndirstande noghte
þat þou sall say þi Pater noster with mouthe als I hafe it here wretyne be-fore
þe.  Bot say all-anely þe nakede lettir with þi mouthe, and thynke in þi herte
of this þat I hafe said here, of ilke a worde by it-selfe; and rekk noghte þof
þou ne multyply many Pater nosters; ffor it es better to say a Pater noster with
gude deuocyone þane a thousande with-owttene deuocyone; ffor þus sais saynte Paule
appertly: he sayse, «me ware leuer say fyve wordes in herte deuotely, þane fyve
thousande with my mouthe with-owttene lykynge».  And one þe same manere sall
þou say and do at thyne offece in þe qweire, for swa sayse þe prophete: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Psallite sapienter,</FOREIGN> and þat es to say, «Synges and versy wyesly».  To say or to synge
wyesly, þat es, þat thi herte be one þat at þou saise, and one þat at oþer saise,
þat þou here it besyly; ffor if þi body be at thi seruyce, and þi mouthe speke
one a wyse, and thi herte thynke of wrechidnes, caytefly þan es þou twynnede,
[and] when þou swa es twynnede, þou tynes þe mede of þi seruyce; ffor þe awe to
serue godde with all þi herte, with all thi saule, and with all þi vertu, and swa
þou may pay þi godde.  Bot þare es many thynges þat ere cause of swylke
wrechede twynnynge, als mete, drynke, Reste, clethynge, layke, discorde, Thoghte,
laboure, hethynge.  These makes hippynge, homerynge of medles momellynge.
And þare-fore take kepe what oure lorde Ihesu Criste saise in þe gospelle: «ffirste,
he saise, sekes þe kyngdome of heuene, and all þat ȝe hafe myster of sall be
gyffene ȝowe with-owttyne any askynge».  Thare-fore, dere frende, þou sall wit what þou sall hafe in þe blysse of heuene.  [XVIII.] Wit þou wele þat þou sall hafe
seuene gyftes in body and seuene in saule, þat es to say: Fairenes in body
with-owttyne fylth, Lyghtenes with-owttyne slewth, Force with-owttene ffeblesce, Frenes with-owttene thralledome, Lykynge with-owttene noye, Lufelynes with-owttyne envye, Hele with-owttyne sekenes, Lange lyfe with-owttyne ende.  Thou sall hafe in saule:
Wysedome with-owttene ygnorance, Frenchipe with-owttene hateredyne, Accorde
with-owttene discorde, Myghte with-owttene wayknes, Honour with-owttene dishonour,
Sekirnes with-owttene drede, Ioy with-owttene sorowe.  Bot þe wreches in helle,
all þe reuerce, both in body and in saule, þat es to say: Fylth with-owttyne
fairenes, Slouthe with-owttene lyghtenes, Feblesce with-owttene force, Thraledome
with-owttene freenes, Angwyse with-owttene lykynge, Sekenes with-owttene hele, Ded

wysdome, Hatredyne with-owttene lufe, Discorde with-owttene accorde, Feblesce
with-owttene powere, Schame with-owttene honour, Drede with-owttene sekernes, and
Sorowe with-owttene Ioy.  And for þis sall þou seke with all þi myghte þat þou
may wyne þe Ioye of heuene; ffor þare es sa gret Ioye and sa mekill swettnes, þat
if þou myghte lyffe fra þe begynnynge of þe worlde vn-till þe ende and hafe all þe
lykynge þat þou couthe ordeyne, ȝit þou sulde with gret ryghte lefe all þase, for to
be a day in þe Ioy of heuene. // And thus endys þe toþer degre of contemplacyone,
þat es to say þe contemplacione of haly writte; of þe whylke if þou take gud kepe
in þi herte, it sall be lyghte vnto þe ilke a worde to halde.  One ane oþer syde,

[aske] at þou may lere more.  And whene þou spekes till sympill mene and ruyde,
gladly þou lere þame [&amp;] with swettnes.  For þou hase enoghe whare-of þou may
speke, and how þou sall þi lyfe amende and gouerne, and oþer mennes alswa.</P><P>[XIX.] Þe thirde degre of contemplacyone es in Godde hym-selfe.  And þat may
be on twa maners, þat es, with-owttene in his manhede, and In, in his godhede
so blyschede.  For þus saise saynt Austyne: «ffor-þi be-come godde mane, ffor to
make mane to se godde in his kynde; ffor wheþer-som he ȝode with-in or
with-owttene, euer-mare moghte man fynde pasture, with-owttene, thurgh consederacyone of his manhede, with-in thurghe contemplacyone of his godhede».  Of his manhede, sall þou thynke thre thyngeȝ: þe meknes of his Incarnacyone, þe swetenes of his conuersasione, and þe grete charite of his passione.  Bot þis may þou noghte do all att anes, and þare-fore hafe I twynned the thaym by þe seuene houres of
þe daye þat þou saise in þe kyrke, swa þat nane houre passe the þat þou ne

þat till ilke ane houre of þe daye es dowbyll medytacyone, ane of his passyone, and
anoþer of þe toþer sesone.  [XX] ¶ Now, dere frende, before matyns sall þou thynke of þe swete byrthe of Ihesu Cryste alþer-fyrste, and sythyne eftyrwarde of his
passione.  Of his byrth, sall thou thynke besyly þe tyme, and þe stede, and þe
houre þat oure lorde Ihesu Criste was borne of his modir Marie.  Þe tyme was in
myd-wyntter, whene it was maste calde, þe houre was at mydnyghte, þe hardeste
houre þat es, þe stede was in mydwarde þe strete, in a house with-owttene
walles; in clowtis was he wondene and als a childe was he bundene, and In a
crybbe by-fore ane Oxe and ane Asse þat lufely lorde layde was, for þare was na
noþer stede voyde.  And here sall þou thynke of þe kepynge of Marye and
hir childe, and of hir spouse Ioseph—wat Ioye Ihesu [hym] sente.  Thou sall
thynke also of þe hyrdes þat saw þe takyne of his byrthe, and þou sall thynke
of þe swete felachip¯e of angells, and rayse vpe thi herte and synge with þame
<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Gloria in excelsis deo &amp;c.</FOREIGN> / Of þe passione, sall þou thynke how þat he was at
swylke a tyme of þe nyghte betrayed of his descyple, and takene als a traytoure,
and bowndene als a thefe, and ledde als a felone ... [XXI.] ¶ Be-fore pryme, þou
sall thynke of þe passione of Ihesu and of his Ioyfull ryssynge.  Of his passyone
sall þou thynke how þe Iewes ledde hym in to þaire counsaile, and bare false
wytnes agayne hym, and put appone hym þat he had saide blasefeme, þat es
sclandyre in godde, and þat he had said þat he suld haue distroyede þe temple
of godde and make agayne anoþer with-in the thirde day; and þane þay bygane to
dryfe hym till hethynge and to fulle hym als a fule, and spite one hyme in
dispyte in his faire face; and sythyne thay hide his eghene, and gafe hyme bofetes
grete and sythene asked hyme whate he was þat hym smate; and sythene þay
ledde hym dreryly to þe dede, and ȝitt neuer he sayde till thaym anes why þay
swa dyde.  Many othyre wykkydnes þay dide hym, þat lange ware to telle. / Ȝitt
before pryme sall þou thynke of þe haly rysesynge: þat at þat tyme of þe daye
Ihesu Ioyfully rase fra dede to lyfe, whene þat he hade destruyede helle and
delyuerede haly sawles owte of þe powere of þe deuelle...  [XXII.] ¶ Ȝitt be-fore vndrone sall þou thynke of þe passione and of þe witsondaye.  Of þe passione sall þou thynke
<EPB/><PB N="1: 236"/>

how þat tyme oure lorde Ihesu Cryste dispytousely was dyspuylede nakkynde, and
bowndene till a tree in Pylate house, and swa wykkedly scourgede and don¯gene,
þat of his swete body fra þe heued till þe fute noghte was lefte hale...  And at
þat ilke houre þou sall thynke of þe witsonnday, how þ[at] tyme of þe day oure
lorde Ihesu Criste sente þe haly gaste till his disciples in liknes of fyre and of
tunnges, in takynnynge þat þay sulde hafe abowndance in worde, and brynnynge
in lufe; and þat ryghte es þe purueance of oure lorde puruayde: ffor in twa
maners þe wykked gaste be-gylede mane in paradyse, þat es to saye, with wykkede
entycement of his tunge, and with þe caldnes of his venyme, and for-þi come þe
haly gaste in lyknes of tung agayne þe Entycement of þe deuelle, and in fyre for
to distruye þe caldnes of his venyme.  [XXIII.] ¶ Be-fore myddaye sall þou thynke
of þe annunciacyone and of Ihesu passione.  Of þe annunciacione sall þou thynke
of þe grete mercy of oure lorde Ihesu Criste, whi þat he walde be-comme mane,
and ffor vs suffire þe dede in þat swete manhede, sene he moghte hafe boghte vs
agayne on oþer manere.  And þat dyde he, for till drawe till hyme þi luffe; ffor if
ane hade bene þi maker, and anoþer thi byere, and hade sufferde in [his] body
es all oure sorowe for to by all oure lufe, than hade noghte oure trouthe bene anely
in ane.  Off þe passione sall þou thynke, at þat houre how oure lorde Ihesu was
done one þe Crosse be-twyx twa thefes, ane one his ryghte syde and anoþer one
his lefte syde, and hym-selfe þay hangede be-twix þame twa, alls mayster of thefes.
[I ne wate what I may say here]; ffor if all þe sekenes of þis werlde and all þe
sorowe ware in þe body of a mane anely, and þat man myghte consayfe alls
mekill noye and angwysce and sorowe in his body als all þe mene of þis werlde
moghte thynke, ȝitt it ware full littill or els noghte to regarde of þe sorowe þat
he sufferde for vs ane houre of þe daye...  [XXIX.] ¶ Before non¯e sall þou thynke of
þe passione and of þe gloriouse ascencione.  Of þe passione sall þou thynke þat at
swylke a tyme of þe daye dyede þe makere of lyfe for þi lufe.  And here sall
þou thynke of þe wordes þat Ihesu spake one þe crose, and of þe foure takynns
þat be-felle in his dede.  The fyrste worde was þis þat he spake: «Fadire, forgyffe
þame þis syne, for þay wate noghte whate þay doo».  The toþer worde was þis þat he said to þe thefe: «For sothe I say the, þis day sall þou be with me in paradyse».  The thirde was þat he saide to his modire of sayne Iohn¯ his cosynne:
«Womane, lo þare thi sone»; and to þe discyple saide he: «Manne, lo þare thy Modire».  The ferthe worde þat he saide was this: «Godde, my godde, whi hase þou lefte me þus?»  The fyfte was: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Scicio,</FOREIGN> þat es to say, «I haf thriste».  The sexte worde was this: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">In manus tuas domine &amp;c.,</FOREIGN> whilke es for to saye: «Fadir, in to þi hanndis I gyffe my sawle».  The seuende worde was þis: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Consummatum est,</FOREIGN> þat es to say: «Now es þe prophecye fulfillede»: and with þat worde he helde his hede downne and gafe þe gaste.  Now þe takynns þat ware in his dede ere þire: ffirste all þe erthe bygane to tremble, and þe vaile of þe temple braste in-twa and felle doune, þe stanes raue in-son¯dire, þe graues opynede and þe dede men rase;
and þe sonne with-drewe his lyghte fra þe werlde fra myddaye to non¯e. / Of þe
ascencione sall þou thynke þat swylke a tyme of þe daye wente vpe oure lorde Ihesu
Criste in till þe mounte of Olyuete, seande his discyples and his swete modire
Marie; how he steighe in till heuene, and sett hym one [his] ffadir righte hande,
and how his dysciples turnede agayne into þe Cete and ware in fastynge and in

prayere vntill þe commynge of þe haly gaste, and þare ware to-gedire a hundreth
and twentty in a house for to abyde þe commynge of þe haly gaste, als oure lorde
commande þame before.  [XXV.] ¶ Before euensange sall þou thynke of Ihesu passione
and of his supere.  Of þe passione sall þou thynke how Ioseph of Aramathy
purchaste Ihesu body of Pilate, and how þey come to þe crosse þare he hange, and
þay brakke þe twa thee-banes of þe twa thefes.  And þare was a knyghte redye
with a spere, and perchede þe syde of Ihesu, and smate hym to þe herte; and
als-sone come rynnande downe þe precyouse blode and watire.  And þat was þe
Rawnsone of þe whilke I before spake — louede be þat lorde!  And þane
Ioseph tuke hym downe of þe crosse, for-þi þat na bodye sulde duelle on þe
crosse in so hye a daye als was one þe morne. / Of þe supere of Ihesu sall þou
thynke how þat tyme he gafe his precyouse flesche and his blude in lyknes of
brede and of wyne þat we may see, and it es sothefastely flesche and blude of
Ihesu Criste þat we may noghte see with bodyli eghene.  Þe thirde thynge es
gastely, þe grace þat we rescheyue whene we take þat flesche and þat blude.
We se þare lyknes of brede and of wyne and it es noghte, bot we trowe þat
þare es sothefastely þe flesche and þe blude of Ihesu Criste.  And noghte-forthi
þe lyknes of flesche ne may we noghte see.  And þare-fore þare whare we
sulde hafe vgglynes als vn-till oure body for to ete flesche and drynke blude of
mane, oure lorde Ihesu Criste turnede his flesche and his blude in liknes of brede
and of wyne, for to comforthe oure bodily witte thurghe swylke fude als we ere
wonnte for to see, and alswa for to helpe oure trouthe, thurghe þat þat we see
a thynge and trowes anoþer.  And þare-fore, dere frende, whene þou sall gaa
for to reschaife þat swete flesche and þat blude of Ihesu thi saueour, luke at þou
haue verray contricyone and repentance and clensynge of thi syne in thi herte,
ffor þare þou ressayfes in sacrament reghte als þou ressayfede hyme in flesche
and blude, bescede be þat grace!  [XXVI.] ¶ Be-fore complyne sall þou thynke how
þat Ioseph and Nicodemus wande Ihesu body in faire schetis, and enoynte it with
precyouse oynementes, and laide it in a monumente of stane, and [þe Jewes] sett þaire
seles apone þe stane, and knyghtes þat sulde it kepe.  The toþer thynge þat þou
sall thynke in þe same tyme es þis: how Ihesus in þe daye of supere, when he
had souppede, he ȝode in till a gardyne with his discyples, and felle downe in
Orysoune, and byganne for to swete one swylke manere þat þe droppis of blode
droppede of his blyssede face vn-till þe erthe.  [XXVII.] // Now hase þou matire and
manere for to thynke of goddis manhede.  And eftirwarde sall þou wit how þou
sall thynke one hym in his heghe godhede.  ¶ To þat, sall þou wit þat godde
temperde swa his knaweynge fra þe begynnynge of mankynde, þat he walde noghte
all hally schewe hym to mane, ne all hally hele hyme fra mane; ffor if he hade
all hally schewede hym to mane, þan hadde trouthe noghte bene worthe and
mysbileue had noghte bene þane ouercomene, ffor trouthe es of thynge þat may
noghte be sene, þan þat at I see es noghte trouthe; and if he had all hallily
helede [hym] fra mane, þan had trouthe noghte bene helpede, and mysbileue hade
bene excusede; and for-thi þane walde he in party schewe hyme, and in party hele
hyme.  Bot now may þou aske me in how many maners he walde schewe hyme.  I
say in twa maners, ane with-In, anoþer with-owttene.  With-In he schewede hyme
thurgh reuelacyone and thurgh resoune; with-owttene, thurgh halye writte and
thurgh creaturs.  Thurgh reuelacyone, whene he schewede hym till any folke thurgh
<EPB/><PB N="1: 238"/>

inspiracione and thurghe myracle.  By resoune commes he till þe knawynge of mane
one þis manere: Ilke a mane may wele see in hym-selfe þat he es, and þat
he hase bene, bot he may wele wit þat he hase noghte bene ay, and f[ro]
þat he wate wele þat sume-tyme he begane for to be, þan was þare sume tyme
whene he was noghte.  Bot whene he was noghte, þan moghte he one na wyese
make hyme-selfe, and þis seghes mane in [ilk] creature, ffor he sees ilke a day sume
ga and sume come; ffor-þi, sene ilke thynges erre, and þay erre noghte of
thayme-selfe, þare-fore it be-houes nede þat þare be ane to gyffe all thynges to be,
þat es to saye, of whaym alle thynges are; thare-fore it behoues of force þat
he thurghe whaym alle thynges erre, be with-owttene begynnynge: ffor if he hade
begynnyng, thane it behoufede þat he had begynnyng of sume oþer, þane had he
noghte bene þe firste autour and þe firste begynnyng of all thyngeȝ.  Bot þare
was nathynge before hyme; þan he come of na noþer, þane hade he neuer na
begynnynge.  And þare-fore it be-houfes one all maner of þe werlde þat þare be
a thynge þat neuer hade begynnynge.  And whene resone of mane sese of force
þat it may na noþer-wysse be, þan he begynnys for to trowe stabilly þat a
thynge [es] with-owttene begynnynge, þat es awtour and makere and
gouernere of all thynges þat ere.  And hym calles mene Godde by this skill, ffor þis
worde <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Deus</FOREIGN>, þat es to say Godde, commes of a worde of grewe þat es called <FOREIGN>theos</FOREIGN>, and þat es als mekill for to say als ane anely Godde.  And þat betakyns þis worde
Godde.  [XXVIII.] And, dere frend, þou awe to wit þat þare ne es bot a Godde ...
And þou awe to wit þat na gude may faile to godde, bot for-thi þat swete thynge
and gud thynge es comforthe of felaschepe, þan may noghte godde be
with-owttene gudnes of felaschipe.  Than behouede it nede þat þare ware many
person¯s in godde, þe hegheste gudnes.  And for-þi þat felyschepe may noghte
be be-twyx faere þane twa, þare-fore behoues it be þat in godde be at þe leste
twa person¯s; and for-thi that felyschipe es littill worthe whare þare es nane
alyance ne lufe, ffor-thi it behoues þat þe thirde persone ware in godde, þat ware
the alyance and þe lufe be-twyx the twa.  And for-þi þat anehede es gude and
manyhede alswa, þare-fore it behouede nede þat anehede and manyhede bathe
ware in godde.  And by þis skill commes mane to þe knaweynge of godde, þat he es
a godde in hyme-selfe, and thre in persones.  And þis ilke may mane see in
hym-selfe; ffor he sese at þe begynnynge þat he hase in hym-selfe Powere, and
sythene eftir powere he hase Wysdome.  And sythene begane he for to lufe þat
wysdome, and þan begynnes he for to knawe apertely þat þare es in þe saule
mighte, and of þat myghte commes wysdome, and of thayme bathe comes Lufe; and
when mane sese þat it es one swylke manere in hym, of þat awe hyme to wit
þat one swylke maner awe it to be in godde þat es abouene hyme, þat es to say,
þat in godde es myghte, and of þat commes his wysdome, and of powere and
wysedome bathe comes lufe.  And for-þi þat of þe fyrste person¯e commes þe toþer, and owte of thayme bathe comes þe thyrde, ffor-thi calles he þe firste person¯e godde þe ffadire, þe toþer godde þe Sonne, þe thirde godde þe Haly gaste.  And for þat it [was] wonnte to be thus in-manges mene, þat þe ffadir was mare ffebill þan þe sonne for his elde, and þe sonne mare vnwyse þan þe ffadire for his ȝouthe,
<EPB/><PB N="1: 239"/>

and for þat a man sulde noghte wene þat it ware swa of godde: thare-fore es
powere appropirde to godde þe ffadir, wysdome to godde þe Sonne; and for-þi þat

when þou hase bene besye owtwarde a while with thi seruantes or with oþer
mene profytabily, þou sall breke offe and come agayne to þi prayers and thi
deuocyone after godde gyfs þe grace, and so sall þou put away by grace of
oure lorde sleuthe, ydilnes, and vayne riste of thi-selfe þat comes vndir
coloure of contemplacione and lettes þe sumtyme fra medfull and spedfull
ocupacione in owtwarde besynes, and þou sall be ay wele ocupiede ouþer bodyly or
gastely. / Thare-fore if þou will do wele þou sall [do] gastely as Iacob dide bodily.
¶ Haly write saise þat Iacob whene he begane for to serue his Mayster Labane,
he couete Rachelle his mayster doghter to his wyfe for hir fairehede, and for
hir he seruede.  Bot whene he wende to hafe hade hire to his wife, he tuke
firste Lya þe toþer doghter in stede of Rachelle, and aftirwarde he tuke Rachelle,
and so he hade bathe at þe laste. / By Iacob in haly writt es vndirstande ane
ouerganger of synnes.  By þise two wymmene ere vndirstandene, as sayne Gregor
saise, two lyfes in haly kyrke: actyfe lyfe, and contemplatyfe.  Lya es als
mekill at say as «trauyliouse», and betakyns actyfe lyfe; Rachelle, «syghte of begynnynge», þat es godde, and betakyns lyfe contemplatyfe.  Lya was frwtefull,
bot scho was sare-eghede.  Rachelle was faire and lufely, bot scho was
barrayne.  Than righte as Iacob couetid Rachelle for hir fairehede and
neuer-þe-lesse he had hir noghte whene he walde, bot firste he tuke Lya and aftirwarde
<EPB/><PB N="1: 275"/>

hir: righte so ilk mane turnede by grace of compu[n]ccyone sothefastely fra synnes
of þe werlde and of þe flesche vnto þe seruyce of godde and clennes of gude
lyffynge, hase gret desyre and gret langynge for to hafe Rachelle, þat es, for
to hafe ryste and gastely swetnes in deuocyone and contemplacione, for þat es so
faire and so lufely; and in hope for to hafe þat lyfe anely, he disposes hym
for to serue oure lorde with all his myghtes.  Bot ofte whene he wenes for to
hafe Rachelle, þat es riste in deuocyone, oure lorde suffers hym firste for to be
assayede wele and trauelde with Lya, þat es, ouþer with gret temptacions of þe
werlde or of þe deuelle, or ells with oþer werldly besynes bodily or gastely in
helpyng of his euencristyne.  And whene he es wele trauelde with þame and
nerhande ouer-commene, than oure lorde gyffes hym Rachelle þat es grace of
deuocyone and riste in concience.  And so hase he bathe Rachelle and Lya.
So sall þou do after ensaumple of Iacob: take þise two lyfes actyfe and
contemplatyfe, sen godde hase sett the bathe, þe tane and þe toþer.  By þe taa lyfe,
þat es actyfe, þou sall brynge furthe fruyte of many gude dedis in helpe of
thyne euencristene.  And by þe toþer þou sall be made and bryghte and
clene in þe behaldynge of souerayne bryghtnes þat es godde, begynnynge and
ende of all þat es made.  And þan sall þou be sothefastly Iacob and ouerganger
and ouercommere of all synnes, and after by þe grace of godde thi nam sall
be chaungede, as Iacobe name was turnede in to Israel.  Israel es als mekill
at say als «a mane seande godde».  Than if þou be firste Iacob and discretly will vse þise two lyfes in tyme, þou sall be aftir Israel, þat es verray contemplatyfe.
Ouþer in þis lyfe he will delyuer þe and make þe free fra charge of besynes

And this sayse saynte Denyse, þat sayse: »When þe herte es lyfte and raueschede to þe lufe of god with gelouse ȝernynges, he ne may sownde with worde þat þe herte

fele it fully bot if his herte solde bryste for lykynge of Ioye.  Sayne Austyne
telles of a preste þat, whene he herde any thynge of god þat lykynge ware Ine,
he wold be so raueschede in Ioye þat he walde fall downe and lygge als he

In what maner he bought vs / euery crysten man knoweth or sholde knowe: / that no lasse pryce / but suffred his owne precyous body to be all to-rente with bytter paynes of scorgynge.

But I trowe there ben but fewe or elles none that folowen them now / for we fynde not by goddes lawe or heste that we sholde l[y]ue so.  For all-be-it they were kepte &amp; susteyned so moost by the myght and grace of god / as no goodnes may be without hym: yet I trowe they lyued so moche by þe strength of kynde that was in man tho dayes.  I wyll not counseyll the to lyue as they dyde / for thou mayst by other maner lyuynge come to the loue of god / as thou shalt se afterwarde.  ¶ I fynde also furthermore of other ful holy men of ryght late tyme whiche lyueden a ful holy lyfe, and toke theyr lyuelode as feblenesse of man asketh now in our dayes.  Some of these men as I haue herde and redde were vysyted by the grace of god with a passynge swetenes of the loue of cryste / whiche swetenes for an example they shewed afterwarde by theyr wrytynge to other men folowynge / yf ony wolde trauayle to haue that hyghe desyre or degree of loue.  This loue whiche they haue wryten to other is departed in thre degrees of loue / whiche thre degrees they hadden one after an other, standynge stablysshed in theyr desyre / and suffrynge pacyently for the loue of god many trybulacyons &amp; temptacyons tyll they come by holy contemplacyon to þe hyghest degre of loue of tho thre.  By this I suppose he that hath grace to come to the fyrst may by goddes helpe come to the seconde / &amp; so with a feruent desyre &amp; good perseueraunce he may come to the thyrde.  Shortely I wyll shewe here these degrees of loue / for [percase] all men and women that sholde rede this haue not knowynge of theym / ne neuer herde speke of suche degrees of loue before-tyme.     ¶ Degrees of hyghe loue.     .I.  ¶ The fyrste loue is so feruent that no-thynge whiche is contrary to goddes wyll may ouercome that loue / welth ne wo, helthe ne sykenes; Also he þat hath this loue wyl not make god ones angry for all the worlde withoute ende / but rather suffre all the payne that myght come to ony creature than ones wylfully dysplease his god in thought or [in] dede. .II.  ¶ The seconde loue is more feruent, for þat is so stronge / that what man loueth in that degre, all his thought, herte &amp; myght is so entyerly, so besely &amp; so perfyghtly stablysshed in Ihesu cryste that his thought cometh neuer from hym
<EPB/><PB N="2: 75"/>

but [only] whan he slepeth.     .III.  ¶ The thyrde degre of loue is hyghest and moost wonderfull / for what man cometh to that loue / all comforte and all solace is closed oute of his herte / but onely the Ioye of Ihesu cryste / Other Ioye may his herte not receyue, for swetnesse that he hath of the Ioye euermore lastynge.  This loue is so brennynge &amp; so gladynge that who so hath that loue may as well fele the fyer of brennynge loue in his soule / as an other man may fele his fynger brenne in erthely fyre.  This loue may well be called a brennynge loue.     And yf men had suche swetnesse in the loue of god of so late tyme, I suppose wel þat þe same we may haue now by the gyfte of god yf we were as feruent in loue as they were.  But these degrees of loue ben set vpon so hyghe loue to god / that what man sholde haue the fyrst of these thre / behoued that he were a sad contemplatyf man or woman, And by cause mankynde is now &amp; euermore the lenger the febler or perauenture more vnstable / therfore vnethes sholde we fynde now a sad contemplatyfe man or woman.  Men of relygyon haue taken dyuerse habytes of contemplatyf lyfe; Men &amp; women also that ben enclosed, as it semeth lyuen a contemplatyfe lyfe / &amp; so with goddes grace they do for the more partye: But for to speke of hyghe contemplatyfe lyfe as holy men lyued before this tyme, it semeth there ben ryght fewe.  Therfore I trowe that I may sykerly say that fewe there ben now that wyl or may trauayle now to haue suche hyghe degrees of loue as I haue reherced before.  Neuertheles what so euer thou be that redest or herest this / be neuer [þe] slower to trauayll. For yf thy desyre be sette feruently &amp; lowly, holdynge the vnworthy to haue so hyghe a ghoostly gyfte before an other man / &amp; puttest thy desyre to goddes dysposycyon trustyngly, he wyll dyspose that is best for the / whether thou haste thy desyre or haue it not.  But it is fyrst nedefull to þe that thou haue other thre degrees of loue that the same holy men wrote in theyr treatyse / whiche be not of so hyghe a degree as tho that be reherced before.     .I.  ¶ The fyrst degree of these is / whan a man or a woman holdeth the commaundementes of god &amp; kepeth hym-selfe out of dedely synne / &amp; is stable in the fayth of holy chyrche.  Also whan a man wolde not for none erthely thynge dysplease god / but truly standeth in his degree whether he be religyous or seculer.  In this maner euery man behoueth to loue his god that wyll be saued: / therfore I counseyll the to haue &amp; kepe this loue or thou clymbe to ony hyer degree. .II.  ¶ The seconde degree is whan a man forsaketh all the worlde for the loue of god / that is for to saye his fader, his moder &amp; all his kynred, &amp; foloweth cryst in pouerte.  Also studieth nyght &amp; daye / how clene he may be in herte, howe chaste in body / how meke &amp; buxom / howe clene in all vertues / &amp; hate all vyces / soo that all his lyfe be ghoostly &amp; none thynge flesshely.     .III.  ¶ The thyrde degree is hyghest / for that is a ful contemplatyfe lyfe, as whan a man or a woman loueth for to be alone from all maner noyse.  And whan that he is saddely sette in this lyfe and in this loue, with his ghoostly eyen than may he se in to the blysse of heuen; And than his eyen be soo enlumyned and so clere lyghted with grace of ghoostly loue, and also thrugh-kyndeled with the gracyous fyre of crystes loue, that he shall haue a maner of brennynge loue in
<EPB/><PB N="2: 76"/>

his herte euermore lastynge, and his thought euermore vpwarde to god.  ¶ Thus as I haue reherced god hath vysyted his seruauntes, gyuynge theym a specyall sauour to loue hym by theyr holy lyuynge.  Many other men and women there be whiche please god full well standynge truely in theyr degree as men &amp; women of the worlde / both lordes &amp; ladyes &amp; other husbonde men women &amp; wyues. For al be it they may not come to suche hye contemplatyfe lyfe, it suffyseth [to] them to haue the fyrst degree of these thre whiche I reherced last / for that euery man is bounde to kepe.  ¶ ¶ Yf thou desyre to haue an hygher degre of loue in to the worshyp of god / trauayle as other men dyde &amp; aske helpe and grace with good perseueraunce / yf it please god to performe thy wyll &amp; brynge the to thy purpose.  But for as moche as there be many that haue not a sadde grounde ne but lytell felynge how they sholde loue and drede god / whiche is spedefull &amp; nedefull for all men to knowe: Therfore to suche as be not knowynge I wyll shewe fyrste in what maner they sholde loue &amp; drede god / that they may be þe more stable in the loue of god.  After that I shall shewe by the grace of god foure degrees of loue / whiche euery crysten man relygyous &amp; seculer sholde holde and kepe, &amp; may performe for the more partye yf his wyll be feruently set to the loue of god.  ¶ Now than as I sayd I shall in the begynnynge with the helpe of god wryte &amp; shewe somwhat of the drede of god / that shal be to his worshyp, &amp; proufyte to the reder.</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="rollecmp:5.1.4" TYPE="section"><HEAD> C ¶ What is drede / and how a man sholde drede god.</HEAD><P>I Rede that þe drede of god is begynnynge of wysedom.  ¶ Drede, as clerkes haue wryten before this tyme, is in many maners.  But I suppose thre kyndes of drede ben moost nedefull for to knowe.  The fyrst is drede of man or drede of the worlde.  The seconde is called drede of seruage.  The thyrde is called a chaste drede or a frendely drede.     .I.  ¶ The fyrst whiche is drede of man or of the worlde is / whan a man or woman dredeth more the punysshynge of the worlde, as betynge the body or prysonynge, than the punysshynge of the soule; Also whan a man dredeth more to lese his temporall goodes in this passynge worlde than to lese the blysse without ende.  / this drede is counted for nought / for god almyghty forbad this drede whan he sayd thus: Dredeth hym not that may slee þe body / but rather drede hym that may sende the body &amp; soule in to euerlastynge fyre.     .II.  ¶ And the seconde drede whiche is the drede of seruage / is whan a man withdraweth hym or absteyneth hym fro synne / more for drede of the payne of helle than for loue that he sholde haue to god. Euery suche man what goodnes he doth it is not for drede to lese euerlastynge blysse whiche he desyred not / but for drede onely of suffrynge of grete paynes whiche he dreded sore.  this drede suffyseth not as thou shalt see afterwarde / but yet it may be good &amp; proufytable.     .III.  ¶ The thyrde drede whiche is called a chaste or a frendely drede is / whan a man dredeth the longe abydynge here for grete desyre that he hath to be with god; Also whan he dredeth that god wyll go fro hym / as peraduenture he withdraweth his grace fro hym; Also whan he dredeth to dysplease god for the grete loue &amp; desyre þat he hath for to please god.  / suche drede cometh of loue &amp; that pleaseth moche god.  Take

than hede how here be reherced thre maner degrees of drede: / fle the fyrst for it is not proufytable.  The seconde may be proufytable / for some men there be whiche drede god by cause they sholde not be sente into hell to brenne there with the deuyls in euerlastynge fyre.  This drede may be good, for by this waye they may come in to the loue of our lorde god, as by this waye that I shall shewe.  All be it that thou drede our lorde god onely for payne, yet louest thou not god whome þou dredest / thou desyrest not yet goodnes of vertues / but thou withstandest þe wyckednes of vyces / whan thou withstandest the wyckednes thou begynnest to desyre goodnes.  Whan thou desyrest goodenes &amp; vertues / than cometh in to the the thyrde maner of drede / whiche is called as I sayd a chast or a frendely drede.  For than thou dredest to lese the goodnes &amp; grace that god hath put in þe / thou dredest than also to lese the blysse that is ordeyned for the / &amp; so by this thou shalt drede god that he forsake not the / whan thou dredest god in this maner thenne hast thou hym sykerly with the / &amp; so for his loue thou shalt desyre to be with hym.  Thus mayst thou well knowe how drede of god may brynge the in to the loue of god / yf thou loue god than thou hast wysedom / so thus the drede of god is the begynnynge of wysedom. Take hede than and drede god in the maner as I haue reherced / for yf thou drede wel god thou shalt not be slowe in his seruyce.  He that dredeth well god leueth no goodnes vndo whiche he may do to the pleasure of god.  Yf thou drede god thou wilt kepe his commaundementes / and the drede that thou hast to god shall brynge the in to euerlastynge sykernes where þou shalt neuer drede. Of the drede of god wexeth a grete deuocyon and a maner sorowe with full contrycion for [thy] synnes / thrugh that deuocion and contrycion thou forsakest thy synnes / and perauenture somwhat of thy worldely goodes.  By that forsakynge thou lowest the to thy god &amp; comest in to mekenes / thorugh mekenes thy flesshely lustes ben destroyed / by þat destruccion all vyces be put out &amp; vanysshed awaye /by puttynge out of vyces than vertues begyn to wexe and sprynge.  Of the shynynge of vertues the clennes of the herte is purchased.  By clennesse of thy herte thou shalte come to full possessyon of the holy loue of Cryst.  By these wordes thou mayst knowe howe þou shalte drede for loue / &amp; how thou mayst come to loue thrugh drede of god.  But the more [þat] loue encreaceth in the / the more drede gooth from the / so that yf thou haue grace to come to a feruent loue thou shalt but lytell thynke on drede for the swetnesse that thou shalt haue in the loue of god.  but yet be thou neuer so parfyte it is nedefull that thou drede discretely as longe as thou art in this worlde.  [And] for as moche as I sayd thou mayst come to loue yf thou drede god / see now furthermore what is charyte &amp; loue to god, How &amp; in what maner thou shalt loue hym / why thou shalt loue hym, How þou shalt knowe whan god of his mercy graunteth the that grace to conne loue hym.</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="rollecmp:5.1.5" TYPE="section"><HEAD> D ¶ What is charyte and how &amp; why thou shalt loue thy god. <LB/>¶ Of foure degrees of loue / &amp; in the fyrst ben fyue poyntes. <LB/>¶ Ordeyned loue.</HEAD><P>CHaryte as I rede is a loue that we sholde haue to god / for as moche as he is almyghty god; also charyte is a loue wherby we sholde loue our neygh-

bour as our-selfe for god.  And these be two pryncypall commaundementes of god.  The fyrst longeth to þe loue of god / whiche is þe gretest commaundement of þe lawe of god; The seconde longeth to þe loue of thy neyghbour and this is lyke to the fyrst; / &amp; thus thou hast what is charyte and loue.  ¶ See now how thou shalt loue god. / thou shalt loue god with all thy herte / all thy soule / &amp; with all vertue, as thus.  Whan þou puttest away from the or withstandest with all thy power all thynge that is pleasynge or lykynge to thy flesshe for the loue of þe blessyd flesshe of cryste / than thou louest hym with al thy herte &amp; al thy soule.  Of this mater thou shalt her more afterwarde; / but se now ferthermore [why] thou shalt loue hym.  ¶ The causes why thou shalt loue god ben without nombre hauynge rewarde to his benefaytes / but two causes we haue pryncypally aboue other.  One is for he loue[d] vs fyrst with all his herte and al his soule swetely &amp; strongely.  Swetely whan he toke flesshe &amp; blood &amp; became man for oure loue.  Strongly whan he suffred deth for loue of man.  The seconde cause is / for ther is no thynge that may be loued more ryghtfully ne more proufytable.  More ryghtfull is there none than the loue of hym that made man and deyed for man.  More proufytable thynge is there none that may be loued than almyghty god / for yf we loue hym as we be bounde / he wyll gyue vs Ioye and blysse without ende / where no thynge lacketh but all thynge is plenteuous and euerlastynge.  ¶ Se now how thou shalt knowe whan god putteth grace in the for to knowe loue.  Whan the trauayle whiche thou hast for the loue of god is lyght &amp; lykynge to the / than thou begynnest to haue sauour in the loue of god.  For ther is no maner trauayle greuous ne trauaylous to hym þat loueth god feruently &amp; trauayleth wylfully for the loue of god.  ¶ Also stedfast loue feleth no bytternesse / but all swetenesse / for ryght as bytternesse is syster to the vyce of hatred / right so swetnesse is syster to þe vertue of loue, so that in loue is all swetnesse.  ¶ Also the trauayle of louers may be in no maner trauaylous ne greuous.  For ryght as hawkers &amp; hunters what euer trauayle they haue it greueth them not for the loue &amp; lykynge that they haue in theyr game / ryghth so what thynge it be that a man loueth &amp; taketh vpon hym a trauayle for that thynge that he loueth, [either] it is no trauayle [to hym] / [or elles] yf it be trauaylous it lyketh hym to haue trauayle for þat thynge whiche he loueth.  Take than good hede of these wordes / for yf thou loue god thou wylt gladly trauayle &amp; suffre for þe loue of god; yf thy trauayle semeth than lyght to the / or ellys yf thou louest or desyrest gladly to haue trauayle for the loue of god thou mayst wel knowe that god of his grace hath put in the a begynnynge to come to loue.  Whan thou hast suche a gracyous begynnynge withdrawe not þat loue from hym for no maner dysease that may fall to the.  For many men &amp; women there be that whyle they be in prosperyte / that is to say / whyle they be in welth &amp; in rest, gladly they wyll shewe loue to god suche as they can:  But yf god sendeth hym ony dysease or ony maner of chastysynge, anone her loue swageth; &amp; that is no sadde loue.  For who so loueth trustyngly &amp; sadly he loueth as well in his aduersyte as in prosperyte / for what god sendeth to vs it is for our proufyte / therfore be it helth be it wo þat he sendeth we sholde hertely thanke hym &amp;

here whyle we lyue in this worlde.  Of the same moost parfyte loue speketh the same clerke thus:  In the fulfyllynge of the countre of charyte / that is to saye / in fulfyllynge of heuen where that all is loue and charyte, This commaundement of god shall be fulfylled where he sayth / Þou shalt loue thy lorde god with al thy herte / with all thy mynde / and with all thy soule; For whyle ony flesshely desyre is in man god may not be loued with all the herte and full mynde. And by this thou mayst knowe that there is a passynge loue whiche may not be fulfylled in this worlde / and that may well be called moost parfyte loue.  But here perauenture some man wyll aske / why it is commaunde[d] / but it myght be performed in this worlde?  To that the same clerke answereth and sayth / that it is skylfull that suche a perfeccyon sholde be commaunded / and this he sheweth by ensample in this wyse.  Ryght as no man may renne euen and sykerly but he knowe whether he shall renne, In the same maner noo man sholde knowe [t]his moost parfyte loue / but it hadde be shewed in the commaundementes of god; Yf noo man hadde knowen it no man wolde haue laboured hym to come therto.  ¶ Now sythen it is so we knowe [well that we so must loue, it is nedeful we] sette vs in a redy waye, whyle we be here, that wyll brynge vs euen to that moost parfyte loue.  A more syker waye is there none in this worlde than the waye of parfyte loue.  Wherfore I counsell the to haue this fourth degree of loue whiche is called a parfyte loue, that [thou] may come the more sykerly to [þe most] parfyte loue.     ¶ Of parfyte loue speketh Saynt Austyn and sayth:  He that is redy to deye gladly for his brother, in hym is parfyte loue.  To this acordeth the wordes of Cryste where he sayth:  No man hath more charyte in this worlde than he that putteth his soule for his frendes / that is to saye than he that gyueth gladly his lyfe for the loue of god to wynne his frendes soule.  This loue is the gretest loue in this worlde / &amp; many there be, I trowe, thrugh the gyfte of god that haue this parfyte loue; but yf it thynke the harde to come to suche an hyghe loue / be therfore not agast.  For other parfyte loue there is wherin thou mayst loue parfytly thy god / as I fynde by the techynge of an holy clerke where he counseylleth in this wyse:  ¶ Yelde we vs to god of whome we be made / and suffre we not theym to haue the maystrye ouer vs whiche ben not of so grete value as we be / but rather haue we þe maystrye ouer theym; As thus / lete reason haue the maystrye ouer vyces / lete the body be subgect to the soule and lete the soule be subgect to god / &amp; than is all þe parfeccyon of man fulfylled.  Thus we sholde lyue by reason as þe same clerke sheweth by ensample. / For as we put lyuely thynges before them þat be not lyuely, Also as we put wytty thynges before them that haue no wytte ne reason, Also ryght as we putte tho that ben not dedely before theym that ben deedly / ryght so yf we wyl lyue parfytly we must putte proufytable thynges before theym that ben lusty and lykynge, Also put them that ben honest before theym that ben proufytable, Also putte theym that ben holy before them that ben honest, And put all thynges that ben parfyte before them that ben holy.  Take hede than of this / for yf thou wylt lyue after this techynge than thou mayst lyue parfytely / yf thou lyue parfytely þou sha[l]t loue parfytely; lyue than thus &amp; thou
<EPB/><PB N="2: 89"/>

shalt come to parfyte loue.     But for as moche as it is full harde to come sodaynly to suche a parfyte loue / therfore take hede to tho thre degrees of loue whiche ben reherced before / &amp; begynne to lyue sadly in the fyrste / &amp; than from þe fyrst clymbe vp to the seconde / &amp; fro the seconde to the thyrde / &amp; yf thou be sadly stabled vpon the thyrde thou shalt lyghtely come to þe fourth where is all perfeccyon / yf thou haue perfeccyon thou shalt l[o]ue perfytely.  Begyn than at the fyrst degree of loue / &amp; so encreace in loue &amp; vertues yf thou wylt come to this degree of parfyte loue.  ¶ I rede that some men begynne to be vertuous / som encreace in vertues / and some be parfyte in vertues.  Ryght so it fareth by the loue of god; as soone as thou art in wyll &amp; begynnest to loue god / that loue is not yet parfyte but thou must stande fast &amp; nourysshe þat wyll / &amp; yf it be well nourysshed it wyll wexe stronge / &amp; yf it hath full strength than it is parfyte.  ¶ To this purpose I rede also that no man may be sodaynly in so hyghe a degree / but euery man that lyueth in good conuersacion / whiche may not be without loue / they must begynne at the lowest degree yf they wyll come to an hyghe parfeccyon.  Thus than, good brother or syster whether thou be, withstande all vyces / and gadre to the vertues for the loue of god, and encreace in them tyll they ben parfytely stabled in the.  And amonge all vertues loke that thou haue a feruent wyll / be besye [in] deuout prayers / stande strongely ayenst temptacyons / be pacyent in trybulacyons / &amp; stable in perseueraunce, that thou lyue parfytely &amp; so come to parfyte loue.  Take none hede of them that set lytell by parfeccyon / as of them that saye þat they kepe not to be parfyte / it suffyseth to them to be lest in heuen / or come within the yates of heuen; these be many mennes wordes &amp; they be peryllous wordes.  For I warne þe forsothe what man hath not parfyte loue here he shall be purged with paynes of purgatorye / or ellys with dedes of mercy performed for hym in this worlde / and so be made parfyte / or he come to heuen blysse / for thyder may noman come but he be perfyte.  Beware therfore of suche lyght &amp; foly wordes, &amp; trust more to thyn owne good dedes whyle þou art in this worlde than to thy frendes whan thou art deed. / Thynke also this lyfe is but short, þe payne[s] of purgatory passe all the paynes of the world, the paynes of hell is euerlastynge / &amp; the Ioye &amp; blysse of sayntes is euermore durynge.  Thynke also ryght as god is full of mercy &amp; pyte, ryght so he is ryghtfull in his domes.  Yf thou wylt thynke on these wordes ofte, I trust to the mercy of god thou shalt waxe [so] stronge in vertues &amp; withstande so vyces þat within a short tyme thou shalt come to a parfyte loue.  Whan god hath so vysyted the that thou can loue hym parfytely than shal all thy wyll &amp; all thy desyre be for to come to þat loue whiche is moost parfyte / that is to saye euermore to se almyghty god in his gloryous godhede, euermore with hym to dwelle.  But for as moche as we may not come to our desyre / but we begynne somwhat to loue hym here in this lyfe:  Therfore almyghty god mercyfull thorugh the besechynge of his blessyd moder Marye graunte vs grace so to loue hym here / þat we may come to the Ioyfull &amp; euerlastynge lyfe / where is moost parfyte loue, &amp; blysse without ende.  Amen. ¶ Here is reherced shortly how by encreace of vertues thou mayst come to parfeccyon &amp; what vertues thou shalt loue.</P><EPB/><PB N="2: 90"/><P>IN this fourth degree of loue / whiche is called a parfyte loue / thou art taught and counseylled to begynne at a lowe degree yf þou desyre to haue an hygh degree, as thus:  Yf thou wylt haue this fourth degree of loue thou must begynne at the fyrst, &amp; so encreace in vertues tyll thou come to parfeccyon.

I trow wel þat euery man wold be good or wolde do some good dede be he neuer so synful &amp; perauenture not chargeth gretly to be good ne besyeth hym to do good dede. But for as moche as he wolde good I may not saye but [þat] he hath a good wyll. So [þat] euery man that wyll well be it strongly or feyntly / lytell or grete / in as moche as he wolde good he hath a good wyll.  Neuertheles though this be a good wyll it is worthy lytell or no mede / for it is no feruent ne besy wyll, for he desyreth to be good without ony trauayle / &amp; so he suffreth that good wyl passe &amp; chargeth not gretly to be good ne to do good dede.  But what tyme he besyeth hym to performe that good wyll in dede / in that he desyreth to be good &amp; besyeth hym to do good though he haue not fully his purpose ne may not performe his wyll in dede / yet there is a feruent wyll &amp; a besy wyll &amp; [as] I hope a medeful wyll.  So that what man desyreth to be good &amp; to do good dede, &amp; therto besyeth hym to performe that wyll in dede, of hym it may wel be sayd that he hath a feruent wyll.  Yet is þat wyll but lytell acounted &amp; feble hauynge rewarde to a grete &amp; stronge wyll.  But what tyme thou hast performed in dede that thou hast so feruently wylle[d], than thou hast a grete &amp; a stronge wyll / so that of euery man that is in wyll to be good or to do good dedes, whan he performeth that wyll in dede it may be sayd sothly of hym þat he is a man of a grete and a stronge wyl.  To this acordeth saynt Austyn &amp; sayth thus:  He that wyl do the commaundementes of god &amp; sayth he may not he hath a good wyll / [but] that wyll is but lytell &amp; feble / for he may do &amp; kepe the commaundementes whan he hath a grete &amp; a stronge wyll.  As who sayth what man hath a grete &amp; a stronge wyll may kepe the commaundementes of god / and but
<EPB/><PB N="2: 91"/>

he kepe them he hath no grete ne stronge wyll.  Yf thou wylt thou mayst kepe the commaundementes of god / yf thou kepe them thou shalt be good &amp; do good / so yf thou wylt þou mayst do good &amp; be good.  But yet somtyme &amp; ofte it falleth that by the grace of the holy ghoost we wyl do somwhat with al our herte to the worshyp of god that is not in our myght ne power to performe in dede; whan our wyll is sette in this maner the goodnes of god is so moche that he receyueth that wyll as for dede.  Of this saynt Austyn bereth wytnes &amp; sayth:  What thou wylt &amp; mayst not do god acounteth for dede.  Thus mayst thou knowe with-in thy-selfe whan thou hast a lytell or a feble wyl / a grete or a stronge wyll / &amp; how acceptable a good wyll is to almyghty god where thou doost thy besynes to performe it in dede.  But se now more openly &amp; in specyal poyntes how thou shalt knowe whan thou hast a good wyl.  Saynt Gregory sayth: We haue a good wyl whan we drede the harme of our neyghboure as our owne dysease / &amp; whan we be Ioyfull of the prosperyte of our neyghboure as of our owne proufyte.  Also whan we trowe other mennes harmes [our harmes] as by waye of compassyon / &amp; whan we acounten other mennes wynnynges our wynnynges as by waye of charyte.  Also whan we loue our frende not for the worlde but for god / &amp; whan we loue &amp; suffre our enemye for the loue of god.  Also whan we do to no man that we wolde that no man dyde to vs.  Also whan we helpe our neyghboure to our power and in wyll somwhat ouer our power.  These poyntes stande moche by the wyll withoute dede / but who so wylleth these fully in his herte to be do hath a good wyll, And as I sayd before his good wyll shall be acounted before god as for dede.  Thus than haue I shewed whiche is good &amp; feruent wyll though it be not performed in dede / whiche is a grete and a stronge wyll / and how good wyll in some poyntes is acounted for dede before god all be it that it be not performed / so that the wyller do his besynes to his power. ¶ Take hede now ferthermore and be ware for though thou haue all these maners of good wyll to thy felynge / it may be so that yet thy wyll is not rygtfull / se how.  Be thou neuer so full of wertues: but thou conforme thy wyll to goddes wyll in all maner thynges bodely and ghoostly thy wyll is not ryghtfull.  To this purpose saynt Austyn sayth thus:  The ryghtwysnes of god is that thou be somtyme hole of body &amp; somtyme syke / and perauenture whan thou art hole and in prosperyte / than the wyll of god pleaseth the moche and thou sayst that he is a good god and a curteys; yf thou say so or thynke so onely for thou hast helth or welth of body / thou hast no ryghtful wyl for as moche as thou conformest not thy wyll to goddes wyll / but onely in helth and welth.  For yf he sente the sykenesse or other dysease / perauenture thou woldest be sory and grutch ayenst the wyll and the sendynge of god / &amp; soo in thy wyll thou woldest make the wyll of god / the whiche may not be but euermore ryght and euen, bowe downe to thy wyll / whiche boweth and is full crocked / and in this thou hast ne[iþ]er ryghtfull herte ne ryghtfull wyll.  But what tyme thou dressest thy wyll that is so croked and makest it stande ryght with þe wyll of god whiche may not be croked but euer standeth euen / that is to saye noo thynge wylle[st] helth ne sykenesse / welth ne wo / but euer holdest the pleased with the wyl

of god, than thou hast a ryghtfull wyll.  ¶ Also it is nedefull to a good wyll that [shall] encreace in vertues and come to the loue of god, that it be stable and resonable.  What tyme thou art trauayled sore with temptacions and grutchest not ayenst goddes wyl but with a glad herte thou thankest god &amp; suffrest hym lowely &amp; thynkest well it is chastysynge to the for thy synnes, than is thy wyll stable. And whan thou desyrest not hygh rewarde in blysse for thy good lyuynge or ghoostly trauayle whiche thou hast here in erthe but onely at goddes wyll what he wyll dyspose for the &amp; no thynge at thy wyll, than thou hast a resonable wyll. Thus I haue shewed the dyuerse kyndes of good wyl whiche be full spedefull &amp; nedefull the for to knowe yf thou be in good wyll to [conne] loue god / &amp; yf thou haue a stable &amp; a resonable wyll þou shalt soone come to parfyte loue.  ¶ Now perauenture thou þat trauaylest in ghoostly werkes wylt thynke or say thus / somtyme it happe[th] that thou woldest do some ghoostly trauayle &amp; thou may not performe it in dede / &amp; all be it so thou do it in dede it is full oft with so grete heuynesse þat thou grutche somwhat for defaute of ghoostly comfort.  To this I may answere as I sayd before: yf þou grutche þou hast no stable wyll, &amp; yf thy wyll be stable þou shalt not drede in this case / &amp; se why.  Thou shalt vnderstande þat the flesshe is euer contraryous to þe spyryte &amp; þe spyryte contrarye to þe flesshe: herof þou hast ensample where saynt Poule sayd of hymself in this wyse:  Þat goodnes whiche I wolde do I do not / as yf he had sayd thus:  Some good dedes I wyll &amp; desyre in my soule / but I may not fulfyl them for feblenes of my flesshe / &amp; all be it somtyme I performe them in dede it is without ony gladnes.  but what, for this trowest þou þat thapostle sholde therfore lese his mede / for he wolde &amp; myght not or els [for] he dyde good somtyme without gladnes? Nay, but moche the more his mede was encreaced, for two causes.  Fyrst for the trauaylous werkynge of his body that he suffred whan the flesshe stryued soo sore ayenst the goodnes of the spyryte.  The seconde cause is for the heuynes &amp; trauayle whiche þe spyryte suffred whan he had no ghoostly comforte.  In the same maner what euer grutchynge thou hast of thy flesshe ayenst good dedes or what heuynesse thou suffrest for defaute of ghoostly conforte / be not therfore abasshed so thy wyll be stable, but suffre &amp; abyde lowely the grace of god for thy more mede.  Be than stable in wyll &amp; the deuyll ne thy flesshe shall neuer haue maystrye of the / for all the deuyls in hell may not make the to synne but þou put therto thy wyll.  Ne all the aungels of heuen may not make the to do good dedes but þou put-to thy wyll.  ¶ Take hede than that thy wyll be well dysposed to god &amp; that it be set stably &amp; resonably / &amp; than thou hast a spedefull begynnynge to come to the loue of god.  but for as moche as mannes wyll is ordeyned fyrst &amp; dysposed with the grace of god that he shall wyll good: to haue that grace in wyll &amp; in all other dede / Prayer me thynketh is nedefull &amp; therfore somwhat I wyl wryte of prayer as god wyll gyue me grace.</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="rollecmp:5.1.21" TYPE="section"><HEAD>U  ¶ What profyte is in prayer and in what maner thou shalt praye.</HEAD><P>PRayer [&amp;] ensample of good lyuynge [be] moost spedefull to gete grace &amp; to drawe men to loue god.

So thus þou mayst se that prayer is spedefull &amp; nedefull.  ¶ Also prayer as I rede is a souerayne helpe to thy soule / confort &amp; solace to thy good aungell / torment &amp; payne to þe deuyl / acceptable seruyce to god / parfyte Ioye / sad hope / &amp; ghoostly helthe without corrupcyon.  ¶ Prayer is also a nedefull messager from euery mannes soule to almyghty god in heuen / &amp; namely from that mannes soule whiche is moche troubled &amp; hath no reste.  Some conscyences there be whiche be good / that is to saye be well ruled &amp; be in reste / to suche prayer is also a nedefull messager to holde þe soule in ghoostly confort &amp; to encreace it &amp; stable it in goodnes.  But there be many other men &amp; wymen of dyuerse conscyence.  Some there be that haue a bad conscyence whiche be in rest &amp; not troubled / &amp; that ben they that ben sette fully to euyll &amp; not to good.  Some haue a bad conscyence &amp; somwhat be troubled in theyr conscyence / &amp; tho be suche þat be somwhat euyll or begynne to be euyll.  Some haue good conscyence &amp; also ben greued in theyr conscyence / &amp; [tho] be suche as lyue euyll &amp; begynne to be good.  Whyle the conscyence is thus troubled the soule hath no reste / therfore to pursyewe for helpe &amp; grace / prayer that nedefull messager must do well his offyce / that is to saye besely without ony taryenge / &amp; strongely without ony feynynge; &amp; rather [to] come to the presence of almyghty god hym nedeth to haue two specyall frendes / þat is to say stedfast fayth and trusty hope: with these two frendes prayer taketh his waye &amp; renneth fast to þe yates of heuen / &amp; entreth without ony lettynge / for he goth to the presence of þat good lorde truly to do his message with full fayth &amp; sad hope / full pyteously he sheweth his nedes &amp; the perylles of [the] soule.  Than anone the good lorde so ful of pyte &amp; mercy sendeth his blessyd loue in to þe soule thorugh the pursute of that good prayer.  Whan this loue entreth in to that soule anone he maketh all glad þat was full elenge &amp; sory / he maketh in peas &amp; reste that was sore troubled.  Hope cometh agayn that was out / and ghoostly strength þat was awaye is fully restored.  Whan the enemyes of the soule / that is to saye the fendes se this helpe &amp; confort to the soule / with sorowfull chere they torne awaye &amp; thus they begynne to crye:  Alas alas, sorowe &amp; wo is come to vs / fle we fast awaye for god fyghteth for this soule.     Thus mannes soule is delyuered fro the fende by prayer / &amp; so it may sothly be sayd that prayer is a spedefull &amp; a nedefull messager fro mannes soule to almyghty god in heuen.  ¶ Thus þou hast herde what is prayer / se now ferthermore how þou shalt praye. ¶ As often as thou prayest / or what euer thou prayest, put all thy wyll in [to] goddes wyll / in the ende of thy prayer / desyrynge euermore in euery askynge his wyll to be fulfylled and no thynge thy wyll.  For thou mayst praye &amp; aske

some thynge that he wyl not here ne graunte / as yf þou praye for soules that be dampned thy prayer is not accepted.  Also it may so be that thou desyrest not that is moost helpynge to thy soule ne to other perauenture for whom þou prayest.  Also many men praye somtyme for no good entent / and for that they be not herde.  Therfore to be alwaye syker, whan euer thou prayest put thy desyre and thy entent in askynge in goddes wyl, for he knoweth all thynges, and what euer thou prayest he wyll not graunte the but that is moost proufytable for the.  To this accordeth an holy clerke and sayth:  Oftentyme god graunteth not many men at theyr wyll / for he wyll graunte them other grace than they aske, to more helth of theyr soules.  So that it is nedeful that we put all our askynge in to his ordynaunce.  To this acordeth [also] saynt Bernarde and sayth: No man sholde set lyght by his prayer / for he to whom we praye aftertyme the prayer is passed from our mouth or from our herte / he wryteth it in his booke / and trustyngly we may hope that he wyll graunte that we aske or ellys that is more proufytable to vs.  Thus than what euer thou prayest put all thy wyll in to goddes wyll.  ¶ Also whan that thou prayest thou shalt praye generally / that is to saye / as thou prayest for thy selfe so thou shalt praye for other.  Thus thou must do for thre causes:  Fyrst for loue and charyte wyll that thou do so. And therfore sayth the apostle:  Prayeth eche of you for other that ye may be saued.  The seconde cause is / for the lawe of god wyll that euery man helpe other in nede.  This thou hast by the techynge of saynt Poule where as he sayth thus:  Eche of you bere others burthen / that is for to say / eche of you praye for other or helpe other in nede &amp; so ye shall fulfyll the lawe of cryste. The thyrde cause is / for who so prayeth for al other as for hymselfe / þe goodnes of god wyll that he shall be partyner of all other mennes prayers. To this acordeth saynt Ambrose &amp; sayth thus:  Yf thou pray onely for thy self and for none other than shall none other pray for the but thy selfe / &amp; yf thou praye for all other than all other shall praye for the.  Thus than whan þou prayest praye for all other.  ¶ Also whan thou shalt praye thou must praye with full herte &amp; put away fro the all vanytees of the worlde, all ymagynacyons &amp; all ydel thoughtes.  To this acordeth an holy clerke &amp; sayth:  Whan we stande to praye we must with all our herte gyue our entent to that we praye / that is to say we must voyde all flesshely &amp; all worldely thoughtes &amp; suffre not our herte otherwyse to be occupyed than about our prayer.  But to this perauenture thou sayst that though þou be neuer in so good wyll to praye / thyn herte is awaye from thy prayer &amp; encombred with dyuerse thoughtes that thou mayst haue no whyle thyn herte sadly vpon thy prayer.  To this I graunte þat what [thrugh] the fende whiche euer is besy to lette all goodnes &amp; what thrugh the vnstablynes of man thyn herte shall not be stable vpon thy prayer I trowe scarsely the tyme of a Pater noster.  But whan thou go to thy prayer / take good hede what nede thou hast to praye / what thou wylt praye / &amp; how grete, how myghty &amp; how ryghtfull &amp; mercyfull he is to whom þou wylt praye.  Yf thou set thyn herte thus in the begynnynge of thy prayer / thou shalt not I trow gretly be

letted / &amp; though it be so that somtyme thou be letted with other thoughtes / fyght ayenst them with all thy besynes / &amp; anone tourne to thy prayer.  Yf thou wylt fyght wylfully in this maner god of his grete grace &amp; endeles pyte wyll alowe thy good wyll / &amp; moche the rather for thy trauayle graunte that þou askest.  Thus than whan thou wylt praye þou must praye with full herte.  ¶ Also an other maner prayer there is / that who soo hath grace to come therto his prayer shal soone be herde yf he praye resonably.  This maner of prayer is whan thou art vysyted by the grace of god with grete conpunccyon of herte and swetnes of deuocyon.  Conpunccyon is a grete lou[nes] of thy soule spryngynge out of thy herte with teeres of thyn eyen, whan þou bethynkest the vpon thy synnes &amp; vpon the dredefull dome of god.  Whan þou hast this conpunccyon &amp; these teeres than þou hast full deuocyon / with suche deuocyon besely praye for all tho that haue nede / for what thynge þou prayest in þat tyme so it be worshyp to god þou art anone herde without ony taryenge.  For as I rede prayer peaseth almyghty god &amp; maketh hym torne to mercy; but whan deuoute teeres come with prayer than of his grete pyte he may no lenger suffre / but anone as he were constrayned he graunteth what we aske.  Ferthermore yf þou be vsed to suche deuocion þou shalt feruently desyre to conne loue god / &amp; so by goddes grace þou shalt soone come to loue / thus than loue prayer yf thou wylt come to þe loue of god.  And for as moche as many men &amp; women be moche trauayled by dyuerse temptacyons or they come to loue / therfore [to] be ware of theym &amp; sooner to withstande them / somwhat I wyl shewe of temptacyons as me thynketh is nedefull.</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="rollecmp:5.1.22" TYPE="section"><HEAD>X  ¶ How þou mayst be ware &amp; knowe of temptacyons wakynge or slepynge / &amp; how þou shalt withstande them.</HEAD><P>BY the ordynaunce of almyghty god there be ordeyned good aungels to defende vs fro euyll &amp; to styre vs to vertues and to kepe vs in goodnes. ¶ Also other badde aungels &amp; euyl spyrytes there be whiche trouble mankynde with dyuerse temptacions to preue mannes stablenes, &amp; that to grete mede to mannes soule.

Of suche men speketh saynt Austyn &amp; sayth thus:
<EPB/><PB N="2: 96"/>

Some men &amp; women profer themyselfe to synne wylfully &amp; abyde not the temptacyons of the fende / but they go before the temptacyons &amp; be redyer to synne than the fende is to tempte them.  ¶ And sythen it is so that euery man whiche is besy to please god shal be trauayled and pr[e]ued with dyuerse temptacyons, I wyl shewe the to my felynge, and as I rede of other auctours, þe maner of begynnynge of euery temptacyon, that thou mayst be ware of them &amp; rather withstande the begynnynge, &amp; so ouercome the hole temptacyon.  ¶ I rede that our enemye the fende whan he wyll make vs to folowe his wyll or ellys for enuye wyll trauayle and greue vs, he begynneth with fals suggestyons / that is to saye he putteth in our myndes diuerse ymagynacyons / as worldely &amp; flesshely thoughtes, and somtyme other thoughtes whiche be full greuous &amp; peryllous / eyther to make vs haue a grete lust &amp; lykynge in them that be worldely or flesshely / or ellys to brynge vs in grete heuynes or drede thrugh tho thoughtes whiche be greuous &amp; peryllous.  ¶ As to the worldely or flesshely thoughtes, yf we suffre theym to abyde in oure herte so longe wylfully tyll we haue lykynge in them / than hath the deuyll wonne a grete stronge warde of vs &amp; pursyeweth ferthermore with all his besynes to make vs assente to hym as in wyll to performe it in dede.  By that dede thou mayst vnderstande euery dedely synne after þe suggestyon is in þe begynnynge.  To some he begynneth with a fals suggestyon of pryde / or ellys of couetyse / to some with a suggestyon of glotonye or lecherye / and so of all other synnes wherin he supposeth soonest to haue maystrye ouer man / for euery man is enclyned more to one maner synne than to an other.  And where he hath maystrye / that is to say where that synne is performed in dede / he besyeth hym sore to brynge it in to custome / &amp; so thorugh the custome to haue vs hole vnder his power.  Go fle &amp; withstande all these perylles, the prophete Dauyd sayth in the sawter: Go awaywarde or bowe awaye from euyll &amp; do good / that is to saye after the exposycyon of doctours: Go from the euyll of suggestyon / from the suggestyon of entysynge / from þe euyl of delytynge / from the euyll of assentynge / from the euyl of dede / &amp; from the euyll of custome.  Withstande than all suche worldely or flesshely thoughtes as moche as god wyll gyue the grace, þat thou fal in none of these euylles whiche as I haue sayd be full peryllous.  ¶ Ferthermore as to þe greuous thoughtes &amp; peryllous, perauenture þou wylt aske whiche be tho thoughtes þat be so greuous &amp; peryllous. All tho thoughtes that thou hast ayenst thy wyl whiche make the heuy or sory, be greuous.  And for to shewe the more openly: what man that ymagy[n]eth vpon hyghe maters þat be ghoostly whiche passe all erthely mennes wytte, As vpon þe fayth of holy chyrche or suche other that neden not to be specyf[y]ed at this tyme, that man hath greuous thoughtes &amp; peryllous.

thy mynde þou sholdest seme in thyselfe that þou were an aungell &amp; no man / therfore it is nedefull that thou be tempted otherwyle with euyll thoughtes that thou mayst se &amp; knowe thyn owne feblenes &amp; vnstablenes whiche cometh of thyselfe / and that þou mayst fele the strength whiche þou hast onely of god. Also thou shalt suffre suche thoughtes esely / but thou mayst voyde them / for all suche thoughtes so þat thou delyte the not in them they ben a grete purgynge for thy soule / &amp; a grete strength to kepe within the vertues / &amp; all be it þat they be sharpe &amp; bytter for the tyme thynke well þat they shal make thy soule clene that was ryght foule / &amp; make it hole that was ryght syke / and brynge it in to euerlastynge lyfe &amp; helth without ende to the whiche lyfe &amp; helth may no man come withoute grete sharpenes &amp; bytternes.  Also whan þou art trauayled with thoughtes whiche þou mayst not put away, thynke wel that it is a grete ryghtwysnes of god that thou haue suche thoughtes: For ryght as þou hast had full often thy wyl &amp; lykynge in worldely and flesshely thoughtes ayenst the wyll of god / ryght so it is þe wyl of god that thou haue other thoughtes ayenst thy wyl.  ¶ But yet it is good that thou be ware of them &amp; that þou drede them dyscretly and truste stedfastly in god.  For whan the soule hath no delyte in suche thoughtes but hateth &amp; lotheth them / than they be a clensynge &amp; a grete mede to þe soule; but yf it so be that there come somtyme ony lykynge of synne or of ony vanyte thorugh suche thoughtes / than withstande &amp; thynke that it is a fals suggestyon of the deuyll / &amp; therwith be dredful and sory that þou hast offended god in lykynge of suche fals ymagynacyons.  I rede that for suche thoughtes onely þou shalt not be dampned though they be come in to thy mynde / for it is not in thy power to let them to come: But yf it be so that þou assente or delyte in them than be ware, for there thou dyspleasest god.  Also it is good that þou drede though þou assente not to euyll thoughtes, that þou fall not for pryde.  For eche man that standeth in vertues standeth onely by þe vertue &amp; grace of almyghty god.  Thus than be ware of thoughtes, for here þou mayst se that all temptacyons begynne with fals suggestyons of the wycked spyryte. And yf þou haue grace to withstande suche thoughtes þou shalt ouercome all temptacions.  And for moost souerayn remedy ayenst all maner temptacions it is good that þou shewe thy disease to thy ghoostly fader as oft as it nedeth [or] els to some other good man of ghoostly lyuynge, as I sayd before in the fyfth poynt of þe thyrde degree of loue.     ¶ Ferthermore to speke of temptacyons, I rede that whan the wycked fende may not ouercome a man wakynge / than is his besynes to trauayle &amp; to tary hym slepynge.  And that is to dysceyue hym yf he may in thre maners.  One is to begyle hym thrugh glad &amp; confortable dremes.  The seconde is to greue &amp; to lette hym thrugh sorowfull &amp; dredefull dremes.  And the thyrde is to make hym the rather assente to synne wakynge thrugh foule syghtes or other dyuerse vanytees whiche he suffreth slepynge. therfore it is good to be ware of dremes / for in some thou mayst wel byleue &amp; some it is good to sette at nought.  for somtyme god sheweth comfort to wycked men slepynge þat they sholde the rather leue theyr synne, &amp; somtyme he comforte[th] good men slepynge to make them more feruent in his loue; but for as moche as þou myghtest lyghtly be disceyued thrugh suche illusyons, I counseyll
<EPB/><PB N="2: 98"/>

the to put them all out from thy herte or els to shewe them to thy ghostly frendes.  For oftymes he þat hath moche lykynge in dremes is moost taryed and out of reste.  Also þou shalt not drede suche dremes what-soeuer they be: For as I rede yf thou be stable in the fayth of holy chyrche / yf þou loue god with all thy herte / yf þou be obedyent to god &amp; to thy souerayns what euer þou be as well in aduersyte as in prosperyte, and yf þou put all thy wyll at goddes dysposycyon, than shalt þou drede no maner of dremes; for though they be dredefull &amp; sorowfull to thy syght be therfor not agast ne heuy / but trustyngly put al togyder in to goddes honde he to ordeyne for the as he wyll.  Also though they be to thy syght glad &amp; confortable, desyre them not ne byleue not in them but yf it [so] be that they torne to the worshyp of god.  Yf þou do thus by the grace of god þou shalt ouercome all temptacions slepynge.  Thus than, slepynge &amp; wakynge, yf thou withstande in the begynnynge þe fals suggestyons of that wycked aungell, þat is to saye wycked thoughtes &amp; peryllous ymagynacyons as I sayd before / than þou shalt ouercome all temptacions.  To this acordeth saynt Austyn &amp; sayth: Yf we withstande the lust &amp; lykynge of vnclene thoughtes there sholde no synne reygne in our dedely bodyes.  Withstande than thoughtes &amp; be stronge ayenst temptacions / &amp; so thrugh that ghoostly strength þou shalt lyghtly come to the loue of god.  And for as moche as suche temptacyons &amp; other worldely trybulacyons fall oftentymes to goddes seruauntes in to grete mede of theyr soules so that they can suffre them mekely &amp; thanke god therfore, I wyll shewe a fewe confortable wordes of þe vertue of pacyence by the whiche þou mayst be styred for to suffre bodely and ghoostly dyseases gladly for the loue of god.</P></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="rollecmp:5.1.23" TYPE="section"><HEAD>Y  ¶ How thou shalt be pacyent &amp; what tyme pacyence is moost nedefull.</HEAD><P>CHaryte whiche is moder &amp; keper of vertues is lost full often by Inpacyence. To this acordeth saynt Gregorye &amp; sayth thus: Men that be Inpacyent whan they wyll not suffre gladly trybulacyons / destroye the good dedes whiche they dyde whyle þe soule was in peas &amp; reste / &amp; sodaynly they destroye [w]hat ghoostly werke that they haue begonne by good auysement &amp; grete trauayle.  By these wordes it semeth þat it is nedefull to kepe with vs the vertue of pacyence yf we sholde come to the loue of god / for without encreace of vertues we may not come to þat loue.  ¶ To speke than of pacyence:  I rede þat in prosperyte it is no vertue to be pacyent / but what man is troubled with many aduersytees &amp; standeth stably hopynge in the mercy of god / he hath the vertue of pacyence. ¶ In thre maner of wayes goddes seruauntes haue nede to be pacyent in trybulacions.  The fyrst is whan god chastyseth them with his rodde / as with losse of worldely godes or ellys with bodely sykenes.  The seconde is whan our enemye the fende trauayleth vs with dyuerse temptacyons by the suffraunce of god.  The thyrde is whan our neyghbours do to vs wronge or despytes.  In eche of these thre our enemye besyeth hym to brynge vs oute of pacyence / &amp; in eche of these we sholde ouercome hym yf we be pacyent.

<EPB/><PB N="2: 99"/>

Also yf we kepe vs sadly in charyte whan we suffre ony wronges or despytes of ony of our neyghbours / thus we sholde ouercome that wycked fende with the vertue of pacyence.  ¶ I sayd as for the fyrst we shold ouercome the fende yf we suffre easely &amp; gladly the chastysynge of god without ony grutchynge / this is good þat we suffre for it is for grete loue whiche he hath to vs &amp; [for] grete mede that he wyll ordeyne for vs.  To this purpose saynt Austyn speketh &amp; sayth thus to eche mannes soule callynge the soule doughter, and sayth thus: Doughter yf thou wepe vnder thy fader wepe not with Indygnacion ne for pryde / for that thou suffrest is for medycyne to the &amp; for no payne / it is a chastysynge &amp; no dampnacyon; yf thou wylt not lese thyn herytage, put not from the that rodde / take no hede to the sharpenes of that rodde / but take good hede how well thou shalt be rewarded in thy faders testament. These wordes may be remeued to euery crysten man &amp; woman, as thus: Yf our fader in heuen sholde chastyse vs with losse of goodes or with sykenes of body we sholde not grutche / but we sholde be sory þat we trespaced ayenste our fader / &amp; take mekely his chastysynge &amp; euer aske mercy.  His chastysynge is hel[þ]e to our soules &amp; reles of grete[r] penaunce / his chastysynge is but a warnynge for loue &amp; not dur[esse] for wrath.  [If] we sholde not be put out frome the herytage of heuen it is nedefull we be boxum to our fader in heuen &amp; suffre lowely &amp; gladly his ryghtfull chastysynge for our greuous trespasynge, that thrugh the vertue of pacyence we may come to that grete herytage / that is to saye to the blysse of heuen to þe whiche he ordeyned vs in his last testament, that was whan he gafe for vs his herte blood vpon þe crosse.  Thus we must suffre gladly the chastysynge of god without grutchynge.  This chastysynge as I sayd is somtyme in sykenes of body / &amp; somtyme in losse of worldely goodes.  Yf thou be chastysed with sykenesse of body / haue in thy mynde the wordes of the apostle whan he sayd thus: All be it that our body outwarde be corrupted with sykenes our soule within is made newe &amp; more clene frome daye to daye.  Also yf [thou] be chastysed with losse of goodes / take hede to þe pouerte of Iob where þou may haue a grete example of pacyence, for with grete thankynges to god he toke full mekely &amp; gladly grete pouerte, sykenes &amp; many dyseases &amp; sayd:  Our lord gafe / our lorde hath take awaye / as it pleaseth hym so it is do / blessyd be the name of þat lorde Iesu.  Thus þou hast example to suffre gladly the chastysynge of god.  ¶ I sayd also as for the seconde we sholde ouercome þe fende yf we delyte vs not in his fals suggestyons &amp; yf we assente in no maner to his wycked temptacyons.  In the last chapytre before thou hast how thou shalt be stronge &amp; stable ayenst all temptacyons: Se now more openly why thou shalt gladly suffre temptacyons without ony grutchynge.  One skylle is for yf thou suffre them not gladly but grutchest ayenst them than þou lettest them that sholde helpe the / the whiche be good angels &amp; other sayntes / &amp; helpest thyn enemyes whiche be wycked fendes / for a greter confort is none to theym but whan they fynde a man heuy and grutchynge; therfore suffre them gladly and aske helpe &amp; mercy of hym in whom all grace is and confort.  Also yf thou suffre suche temptacions gladly and assentest not to them in lykynge ne in wyll / than thou stoppest the

fende that he dar not assayle the with other temptacions, for he dredth to be put out from the &amp; be ouercome whan he feleth the so stable &amp; so pacyent; that is a grete drede to hym.  For whan he trauayleth a man with temptacyons and he be withstande / than be his paynes moche the more encreased in hell.  Withstande than his temptacyons with the vertue of pacyence &amp; so thou shalt ouercome hym.  ¶ As for the thyrde way of pacyence I sayd þat we sholde kepe vs sadly in charyte whan we suffre wronges or despytes of [our] neyghbours / suche wronges it is [m]edefull to suffre for the loue of god:  For as saynt Austyn sayth / he that is so pacyent that gladly wyll suffre wronges shall be ordeyned grete and myghty in heuen.  If than thy goodes be taken from the wrongfully / suffre esely and thynke in thy herte that thou came naked in to this worlde &amp; no better than naked shalt thou go away out of the worlde.  Also thynke vpon þe wordes of the apostle where he sayth: Nought we brought in to this worlde and no thynge we may bere with vs / thynke vpon these wordes &amp; I trowe they shall styre the moche to pacyence.  ¶ If thou be dysp[y]sed or defamed wrongfully / thynke vpon the wordes of cryst whan he sayd thus to his dyscyples: Ye be blessyd whan wycked men curse you or despyse you wrongfully, whan they pursyewe you or saye ony euyll makynge lesynges ayenst you wrongfully / Ioyeth than &amp; be glad for your mede is plenteuous in heuen.  These wordes me thynketh sholde make the to suffre gladly despytes &amp; euyll wordes.  It falleth somtyme that some mennes hertes be full grete &amp; stoute by pryde &amp; Inpacyence: But goddes seruauntes whan they se suche men so dyseased and trauayled in theyr soules, haue grete conpassyon of them knowynge wel that it cometh of vnstablenes of herte and of wycked sterynge of the flesshe / &amp; therfore they suffre wycked &amp; angry wordes for þe tyme, hopynge þat after so grete noyse shall come some maner ease &amp; lownes of herte; they suffre also for þe tyme for they knowe well it is full harde a man to ouercome hymselfe; / for thyse causes euery good man sholde gladly suffre angry wordes.  Also some men and women there be that wyll not suffre / but for one wycked worde they saye an other and take noo hede to the rewarde that they sholde haue of god yf they wolde suffre / suche men al daye fall in temptacyons for angre of herte and for inpacyence.  Therfore what euer thou be that art despysed of thy neyghbour, suffre gladly / &amp; feyne the as thou herdest hym not / vnto the tyme that his herte be eased, and than yf it be suche mater that chargeth þou mayst speke to hym in easy maner / and yf it is no chargynge than it is no force though thou holde thy peas and answere ryght nought.

But thou be perseueraunt / þou mayst haue noo mede, thanke ne worshyp for thy seruyce.  Yf thou be perseueraunt thou shalt haue mede for thy true seruyce / &amp; a grete rewarde for thy ghoostly trauayle &amp; a worshypful crowne of vyctorye for thy stronge batayle.

But I counseyll the in fewe wordes yf thou wylt be perseueraunt in goodnes that þou trauaylest to wynne the vertue of pacyence wherof I haue touched somwhat in the last chapytre before.

For sothely whan a man is sharpely tempted he may than haue hope of gr[et]e vertue / and it is necessary for a man moche to be troubled with temptacyons / for euery vertue is proued by his contrarye. Our enemy the fende is besy daye and nyght to tary and trauayle good men and women with dyuers temptacyons / in doubtes of the fayth and dredes of saluacyon and other many moo in dyuers maners, and specyally now in these dayes he is full besy to deceyue many soules / and therfore wysely rule you to withstande his vyolent sterynges of temptacyon / &amp; for all that take ye noo dredes of his assawtes / ne haue ye ony doubte of his erroures ne dyspytes nor of his false leasynges or fantasyes or ony maner of trauayle of that foule fende; whether ye here hym / se hym or thynke of hym take noo hede therof / for all be maters of grete mede and noo synne in noo wyse be they neuer soo troublous or full of anguysshes whyles it cometh of the malyce of the fende or of euyll dysposycyon of mannes nature or compleccyon.

And for as moche as they be maters of grete mede none ought to stryue there agaynst / nor meruayle of them ne seke the cause nor thynke by what skyll he is soo trauaylled / for the more that a man laboureth in sechynge and thynkynge of suche anguysshes the more depely he falleth in to errours / and therfore in as moche as mannes thought is often vayne and dyuers and none ende hath:  it ought not to be forced or be taken hede of / ne a man sholde not angre hymselfe therwith ne blame ne impute it to his owne defaute that he is so troubled / for suche trauaylles ben paynefull but not synfull in soo moche as they be gretely agaynst his wyll.

Therfore let vs haue alway a good wyll to wyll well and doo well / and god wyll kepe vs and gyue vs the vyctory / &amp; so the fende shall be confounded.

But some men whan they haue drede of saluacyon or be tempted to dyspayre by vysyons or ghostly sterynges of theyr owne frayltye / they wene anone that they haue synned in the synne of the holy ghoost / and than the fende putteth in them that they may neuer be saued nor forgyuen of theyr trespaces.  Thus speketh the fende within them, so ferynge s[um]e good creatures that they wene to goo out of theyr myndes.  But [ye] that ben thus tempted answere the fende thus agayne that he is false and a lyer as his nature is to be.  For the synne of the holy ghoost as clerkes sayth is infynyte without repentaunce.  And that is whan a man wylfully by delyberacyon wyll neuer repente nor aske god mercy ne forgyuenes of his synnes / nor wyll be tourned / but wylfully departeth hym from the goodnes of god / and in [t]his wretchednes abydeth wylfully with full consent of wyll; he that doth thus synneth in the holy ghoost whiche may not be forgyuen here nor elles where / for he wyll not trust in the goodnes of the holy ghoost nor aske forgyuenes of his synnes, And therefore he that wyll noo mercy aske noo mercy shall haue / for his synnes be infynyte without repentaunce.  But thoughe a man or a woman haue or fele all these vycyous sterynges and as many moo as ony herte can thynke ayenst theyr owne free wyll, and whan reason cometh to them they be sory therof &amp; flee alwaye hastely to the mercy of god:  it is to them but a preuynge or a clensynge of theyr synnes though they be neuer soo ofte in the nyght and the daye now vp now downe as wrestlers be / &amp; thoughe ye haue ony tyme fall in ony synne ghoostly or flesshely &amp; layne therin wylfully by delyberacyon and full content of herte:  ye than ought to be sory and aske god forgyuenes with as grete contrycyon as god wyll gyue you grace / and than thynke fully the goodnes of the holy ghoost surmounteth all synnes that euer was done or euer shall be done / [for] though a man had synned in them all / as well in dede as thought / he beynge truly contryte &amp; confessed mekynge hymselfe lowly to almyghty god and to his sacramentes of holy chyrche / doubte ye not he so askynge mercy shall haue full forgyuenes of all his synnes / for the mercy of god is so grete that it passeth all his werkes.

haue not the strength of Baptym ne the precyous oyntement of crystes passyon / that sholde gyue to theyr soules lyf and helth.  Of this [we] haue example &amp; a grete fygure in holy wryte that where as Moyses ledde the chyldren of Israell ouer the reed see whiche were goddes people, Moyses wente before them and smote the water with his rodde and therwith the water parted &amp; the chyldren of Israell wente ouer in suertye, And they of egypte that folowed perysshed &amp; were drowned.  By Moyses I vnderstonde our lorde Ihesu cryste / and by the yerde or rodde that departed þe water I vnderstonde his holy passyon / and by the chyldren of Israell that were not perysshed all crysten people:  for ryght so our lorde Ihesu cryst came from his faders bosome to the see of trybulacyons &amp; temptacyons to be our guyde &amp; leder / he gooth before vs with his precyous passyon &amp; smyteth awaye the perylles of our troublous temptacyons / so that we shall not perysshe / but it shall brynge vs to suertye of euerlastynge lyf; and therfore gyue we to hym thankynges, louynges &amp; infynyte praysynges as the chyldren of Israell dyde.  For thoughe a crysten man were neuer soo synfull thynkynge hymselfe þat he stode in the sentence of the hardest wordes that be wryten:  yet sholde he trust faythfully in the mercy of god / for and he wyll forsake his synnes &amp; tourne hym to good and vertuous lyf:  he shall haue grace and forgyuenes / and the harde sharpe wordes of dampnacyon sholde tourne hym to mercy and saluacyon.  For thus sayth our lord god in holy wryte by his prophete Ieremye: though I make grete thretes I shall repent me of my wordes yf my people wyll repent them of theyr synnes.  O beholde the grete goodnes of our lorde / and how pyte alwaye constrayneth hym to mercy, worshyp and thankes be euer to his goodnes; he is so benygne and mercyfull to them that be repentaunt that he frely wyll chaunge his sentences from sharpe vengeaunce to forgyuenes / &amp; of the paynes that they be worthy to suffre / gyue them alygeaunce or lyghter payne to suffre.  He sayth also by the prophete I saye:  I shall forgyue the synnes of euery man that with very true contrycyon wyll drawe hym to good and vertuous lyfe.  And this grete mercy shewed our lorde openly vpon the Cyte of Niniue / and also by kynge Eȝechie.  Therfore lette noo man dyspayre but alwaye trust fully to goddes mercy that so well can redresse our myscheues and tourne all our woo to wele / and our sorowe to Ioye.  O thou gloryous [&amp;] myghtyfull god that thus meruayllously werketh in thy creatures, it is to se that thy mercy is large and brode whiche maketh the to chaunge thy sentence that before was bothe thy wyll and worde / blessyd be thou good lorde in all thy vertues for thou canst / may / and wyll tourne and chaunge all our infyrmytees to our moost proufyte yf we wyll not flee from the / but tourne to thy goodnes and aske mercy.  But for all this grete goodnes / god forbede that ony man sholde be the more bolder to synne, or wylfully and wyttyngly by delyberacyon sholde presume to falle to synne vpon trust of [his] mercy; and [for] our lorde is so mercyfull I surely trust that euery true courteys soule wyl be the more lothe to offende his goodnes. [But] as for you that be tempted ayenst your wyll / and wyll not for all the worlde dysplease god wylfully:  but that ye be thus begyled and encombred by the fende with many paynefull thoughtes / be ye not afrayde of the fende nor of his fere-

full assawtes / for he is full sore dyscomforted whan that he seeth a man or a woman whiche he soo tempteth is not aferde of hym.  Somtyme the fende cometh and tempteth a soule fyersly lyke a dragon / and somtyme he assaylleth hym lyke a rampynge lyon; but and yf a creature strength hymselfe saddely in the passyon of almyghty god / and arme hym with that holy passyon / a thousande suche fendes how someuer that they come shall haue noo more power ouer hym thenne hath as many flyes or gnattes.  And therfore strength you all in god / and be not abasshed soo to strength and arme you in hym though ye be synfull / for he sayth hymselfe in the gospell he came for synners.  And in an other place of the gospell he saythe that he came for mercy and not for noo vengeaunce / and to be our shelde and strength; and so lette vs humbly with a meke herte take hym.  And yf ye fele ony dredes by ymagynacyon or temptacyon or for wordes that ye haue herde or redde in bookes by the whiche ye doubte of saluacyon / than thynke on the wordes that cryste hymselfe taught to a man that doubted / sayenge and askynge of our lorde who sholde be saued / for he thoughte it was to harde to hymselfe for to eschewe all the poyntes that ledde man to pardycyon.  And our lorde badde hym for to saye <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Credo in deum patrem omnipotentem creatorem celi et terre, Et in iesum christum filium eius,</FOREIGN> Byleue sayd our lorde Ihesu that god the fader is almyghty and that no thynge to hym is impossyble but that he may forgyue all synnes and redresse all wronges and brynge the soules to his blysse.  and thynke ferthermore that his myght and power may do all that his wysdome can / and his goodnes wyl / and therfore truste fully that by his goodnes he wyll saue you and brynge you to euerlastynge Ioye whan he seeth best tyme / for he hath bought you full dere with his precyous blode and paynefull deth.  And I dare sauely saye that there is none so synfull a caytyf whiche is crystened or wolde be crystened this daye on the erthe all thoughe he were in the syght of god dampnable and in the syght of all creatures also, ye and yet were Iuged to be dampned by all scrypture, and he wolde forsake his synne and be contryte and aske god forgyuenes he sholde haue mercy and forgyuenes of hym / &amp; yf it were so that he stode in that case or had a good mynde to stonde so in the tyme of deth he sholde be saued / the myght &amp; mercy of god is so grete that it surmounteth all his lawes, Iugementes and scryptures. And so our lorde Ihesus sheweth vs by an example in the gospell of a woman that was founde in aduoutry and by Moyses lawe whiche was ordeyned by god þat she sholde be stoned to the deth:  But the myght and the wysdome of that blessyd lorde god was soo gretely shewed to the pharyȝens whiche accused her that they so largely perceyued theyr synnes that they myght not for shame deme her but stale awaye out of the temple, And our lorde Ihesu wolde not deme her but of his gracyous mercy forgaue her all her synnes.  And therfore be a man or woman neuer soo synfull and that they fele neuer soo many bodely and ghostly synnes alwaye rysynge and sterynge within them / they sholde neuer the rather dyspayre of the mercy of god / ne be dyscomforted.  For there as moche synne is / there is shewed moche mercy and grace / and the goodnes of god is knowen by the forgyuenes of the synne whan a body turneth hym there-from and is very

contryte; but god forbede as I sayd before that ony creature be the more recheles or bolde to synne wylfully / for in so moche the mercy of god is so large we ought to be the more besy and dylygent to loue and prayse hym.  Almyghty god werketh lyke a leche / for a leche suffreth somtyme the deed flesshe to growe on hym that he hath in cure / but afterwarde he taketh away the same and maketh the quycke flesshe to growe / and soo he heleth the pacyent.  Ryght soo dooth our lorde Ihesu cryste maker of heuen and erth, suffreth somtyme a man or a woman to fall in deedly synne:  but afterwarde of his grete mercy and pyte he putteth-to his hande of grace / for they that were deedly wounded thorough synne he heleth them and wassheth away theyr synnes with the water of his well of mercy / &amp; maketh in them quycke vertues to growe wherby he gyueth to theym euerlastynge lyfe.  Oure lorde god is also lyke a gardyner:  for a gardyner suffreth somtyme wycked wedes to growe in his gardyn / and whan the erth thorugh moysture of rayne wexeth tender he taketh &amp; pulleth awaye the wedes bothe rote &amp; rynde.  So in lyke wyse dooth our lorde Ihesu cryst, he suffreth somtyme in his gardyn whiche is mannes soule wycked dedes of synne to growe / but whan the herte of man wexeth tender by mekenes and moysture of contrycyon he than taketh away all the synnes bothe rote and rynde and planteth and setteth in his gardyn herbes and fruytes of good vertues / and watreth them with the dewe of his blessyd goodnes / wherby the soule of man shall come to euerlastynge Ioye and reste.  Now than sythen our lorde god is so good, so pyteous and soo mercyfull to synners that wylfully offendeth hym by commyttynge of horryble synnes / moche more he is mercyfull and hath pyte and compassyon of a soule that thorughe trouble and temptacyons falleth to synne / for almyghty god suffreth often tymes the soule of man for to be tempted and vexed in withstandynge temptacyons / wherof it deserueth the more meryte.  And therfore be ye not doubtefull nor heuy for it shall neuer tourne you to peryll ne daunger but to grete proufyte.  For therby ye shall wynne the crowne of glorye and the palme of vyctorye whiche shall be gyuen to you for withstandynge of suche temptacyons &amp; to the fende it shall tourne to shame and confusyon; and though it semeth to you somtyme that ye fele dyscorde bytwene god and you be not therfore recreaunt ne dyscomforted, For almyghty god sayth by his prophete Isaye: A lytell whyle I haue forsaken and hydde my face from the:  but I shall call the to me agayne by my ma[ny]folde mercyes whiche euer shall endure.</P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="rollecmp:5.2.2.5" TYPE="chapter"><HEAD>¶ The fyfte chapytre.</HEAD><P>ANnd therfore grutche not agaynst the wyll of god ne meruayle not of these temptacyons / for the more that a man or a woman be tempted in this maner or in ony other agaynst theyr wyll and they withstande it that is to saye not wyllyngly consentynge therto but mekely suffreth the same:  the more they shall encreace in vertues to the proufyte of theyr soules in the syght of god thoughe it be hydde from them.

For ye shall vnderstonde that euery man and woman hath two wylles, a good wyll and an euyll / the euyll wyll cometh of sensualyte the whiche is euer inclynynge downwarde to synne / and the good wyll cometh of grace whiche alwaye styreth the soule vpwarde to all goodnes; and [for] whan reason cometh to you ye haue alwaye a good wyll to do well / &amp; [ar] myscontent with all euyl thoughtes &amp; sterynges that ye fele / and putteth your wyll onely to the wyll of god:  though ye thrugh suche wycked thoughtes &amp; sterynges by vyolence and sharpnes be enclyned to sensualyte yet ye do it not ne consent therto but it is the sensualyte that dooth it in you / and your good wyll abydeth in you styll vnbroken though the cloudes of euyll thoughtes stoppeth your syght from the felynge of your good wyll:  as ye may se by ensample of the mone / for the mone shyneth alwaye in her dewe place as well whan we se her as whan we se her not, But oftentymes the cloudes shadoweth and putteth from vs the syght therof; and so in lyke wyse it fareth by your good wyll whiche standeth alwaye vnbroken in you by the grace of almyghty god though ye fele it not thrugh trauayllous thoughtes whiche taketh awaye the syghte of your knowlege.  Therfore ye good chyldren that sharpely be vexed with suche temptacyons &amp; tribulacions, comforte yourselfe in your benygne &amp; mercyfull fader that sayth to you by his prophete in holy wryte:  my chyldren though ye go in þe fyre drede ye not / for þe flambe therof shall not trouble you.  As who sayth ye that be crysten people wyllyng to do well, though ye goo in the fyre of trybulacyons &amp; temptacyons drede you not for it shall tourne you to no peryll / but thorugh my goodnes &amp; the merytes of my passyon it shall tourne you to grete proufyte &amp; comforte of your soule. The maner of all these temptacions &amp; þe remedyes of þe same sheweth our sauyour Ihesu cryst to his apostle saynt Peter as it appereth in þe gospel where he sayth thus:  Peter sathanas asketh &amp; desyreth to syfte the as men syfte whete / wherby it appereth well þat the fende hath no myght ne power to attempte þe seruauntes of almyghty god but by his suffraunce / &amp; that was euydently knowen by the temptacyons of Iob whome the fende besyfted and tempted.  For þe more þat whete is syfted &amp; cast from syde to syde the more clene it is:  Ryght so the more þat a man or a woman be tempted with the fende ayenst theyr wyll / the more clene they be afore god / wherfore it appereth playnly þat almyghty god suffreth not his seruauntes to be tempted but for theyr grete wele &amp; profyte yf they purpose them-selfe myghtely to withstande the fendes temptacyon; whiche no man may withstande without the helpe of god, Therfore of his helpe he maketh vs sure lyke as he sayd to peter these wordes:  I haue prayed for the that thy fayth fayle the not.  And therfore that man whiche pacyently is redy to suffre all troubles and dyseases for the loue of his maker almyghty Ihesu not takynge hede of all the fendes mocyons and temptacyons:  that man thrugh the myght and grace of cryst bereth downe and ouercometh the fende / wherby he may be called a vaynquyssher or ouercomer.  And to suche men may be sayd thus:  thou that arte thus tourned to almyghty god by the vertue of pacyence / but yf thou helpe to counseyle &amp; conferme thy bretherne And teche them to suffre as the grace of god hath taught the:  or elles thou arte vnkynde.  For Salamon sayth that one brother well counseylled &amp; confermed by an other is a myghty Cyte ayenst the
<EPB/><PB N="2: 115"/>

fende / and therfore they that be sharpely trauaylled and tempted, whan they haue had the good counseyle of theyr brother they ought to take comforte to them sayenge with Dauid whiche sayth:  O my soule why arte thou so vnstedfast thus to assayle and trouble me:  trust onely to almyghty god that is full of benygnyte and mercy, whome I onely confesse and knowelege to serue be I neuer so sore trauaylled ne troubled.  And to suche men thus vexed with thoughtes, mocyons &amp; sterynges is behouefull to take the counseyle and techynge of the wyse and dyscrete persones fleynge vtterly theyr owne wylde fantasyes whiche often tymes gretely troubleth them.  And in eschewynge of suche temptacyons and troubles they must gyue themselfe to good &amp; vertuous occupacyons / as to redynge and sayenge the seruyce of almyghty god / and doynge other vertuous dedes / and euer amonge prayenge to almyghty god they may haue strength in theyr soules to resyste suche mocyons and temptacyons.  And though they fynde in themselfe noo maner of swetenes ne sauour in goddes seruyce:  yet they ought not to be heuy therfore yf theyr wyll and mynde be to fulfyll the same.  For as holy wryte sayth euery good wyl is accepted for the dede.  Saynt Barnarde sayth that somtyme god withdraweth deuocyon from prayer to make the prayer more medefull / for he wyll be serued somtyme in bytternes and somtyme in swetenes whiche bothe two we muste mekely receyue.  And therfore Arystotle sayth that with the more dyffyculte and trauayle vertuous ben goten:  the more they proufyte and encrease in the soule. It was no maystry for saynt Peter whan he sawe almyghty god on the hyll of blysse, to saye / lorde it is good for vs to dwell here.  But afterwarde whan he sawe hym amonges his enemyes cruelly turmented a womans worde fered and put hym in suche drede that he forsoke and denyed his mayster.  But whan thorugh the myght of the holy ghoost he was reconsyled and confermed agayne: than was there no turment in erth that kinge or prynce put vnto hym coude fere hym.  Ryght so yf a man be in perfyte rest and quyetnes of herte / it is no maystry for hym to serue god:  But it is a maystary to hym that is in trauayle and out of quyetnes of herte to serue hym.  Therfore that creature that is tempted or vexed in the seruyce of almyghty god and is in wyll to withstande the sayd temptacyons tyll he after be strengthed and comforted by the holy ghost the fende shall neuer haue power to fere ne put hym in drede / for though it be longe or he fele comforte yet let not hym drede / for our mercyfull sauyour knoweth what tyme comforte is moost nedefull to hym [&amp;] than he fayleth not to gyue it hym.  For somtyme the felynge of swetnes is withdrawen from man or elles he sholde wexe proude and presumtuous or neglygent and recheles in vertuous lyuynge / and therfore it is withdrawen for the best to the helth of his soule / wherfore hardnes and sharpenes sente to a creature is full proufytable to the soule:  as saynt Austyn sayth in techynge vs of the maner of almyghty god that whan a man is feble and newly tourned to hym he gyueth hym peas and swetnes to the entent to stablysshe hym in his lawe and loue / But whan he is stablysshed and sadly grounded in his loue:  than suffreth he hym to be vexed and trauaylled, for two reasons / one is to proue hym and to crowne hym the hyer in the blysse of heuen, An other is to pourge hym of his synnes in this worlde that in noo wyse he be from hym in the euerlastynge worlde.</P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="rollecmp:5.2.2.6" TYPE="chapter"><EPB/><PB N="2: 116"/><HEAD>¶ The syxte chapytre.</HEAD><P>ANd for as moche as many men can not nor wyll not in tyme of temptacion se or perceyue it but haue a dredefulnes and a sorynes in themselfe by sterynge of theyr compleccyon / therfore to all suche men thre thynges be nedefull &amp; necessarye.

The thyrde remedye is this / that for as moche as the fende laboureth to make a man dredefull and sorye / a man agayne ought to the honour of god and confusyon of the fende to strength hymselfe and be mery though it be ayenst his herte / and drede noothynge the fendes malyce.  For the lesse gladnes that he feleth in hymselfe the more meryte he shall haue whan he so enforceth hymselfe to be mery to the honour of god / and in spyte of his ghoostly enemy the deuyll.  For as holy wryte sayth the holy appostles wente awaye mery &amp; gladde whan the Iues enemyes of god had shamefully beten them. Also a man ought to be gladde for thre causes whan the fende tempteth and turmenteth hym:  The fyrst is that he is troubled by the enemy of god.  The seconde is by suche temptacyons and turmentes the fende sheweth playnly that he is his enemye, and euery man ought to be gladde that goddes enemy is his enemy. And the thyrde is that by suche turmentes a man is not onely released of the paynes in purgatorye but also it maketh hym to wynne euerlastynge blysse.  Our lorde Ihesu sayth in the gospell:  blessyd be they that suffreth persecucyon for ryghtwysnes for they shall haue the kyngdome of heuen.</P></DIV4><DIV4 NODE="rollecmp:5.2.2.7" TYPE="chapter"><HEAD>¶ The seuenth chapytre.</HEAD><P>ALso it is to vnderstonde that our olde enemy the fende is ofte tymes aboute to begyle mannes soule in dyuers and many maners / somtyme he styreth man vnder colour of goodnes to deceyue hym whan he is well dysposed, and specyally in thre thynges whiche I wyll speke of.  One is that though a creature be it man or woman be neuer so well ne soo ofte shryuen / yet the fende maketh them byleue they are not well shryuen / and that he dooth to brynge the soule in heuynes / and so anoyeth &amp; troubleth the poore soule that he maketh hym to forgete what he wolde saye / &amp; therby maketh hym out of rest tyll he be newly shryuen agayne.  But this doth he not for that he wolde that ony were often and well shryuen:  but fully to lette and trouble hym / and to make hym byleue that he were blynded by synne and out of grace wherfore he myght not make hymselfe clene.  The seconde whyle and colour that the fende maketh to withdrawe goodnes is th[is] whan a man or a woman by deuout sterynges of thoughtes haue felynges of contemplacyon and medytacyon as perauenture some solytarye persones hath:  and he maketh them to thynke that to holde &amp; kepe that medytacyons is to theyr moost proufyte to thentent they sholde leue theyr dyuyne

seruyce that they be bounde to / and bryngeth them in suche a combraunce that they wote not whyche waye is best to them to take; and all this he dooth vtterly to deceyue them and cause them to be vnquyet to doo ony of theym bothe.  The thyrde crafte or wyle that he tempteth with is whan a man or a woman gyueth them to honest dysporte to strength themselfe ayenst his false wyles to the comforte of theyr owne soule / than wyll the fende cause theym to haue a conscyence therof / and putteth in to theyr myndes that all suche dysportes is but synne and vanyte, And many tymes bryngeth in to theyr myndes agayne the synnes that they before had done and were confessed of; And all that dooth he to brynge them in to heuynes and dyscomforte to thentent he myght brynge theym to dyspayre.  Neuertheles there be good remedyes in these temptacyons. For as vnto the [first] where the fende whan they be neuer so clene shryuen alwaye putteth them in a doubte that they haue not shryuen them well or elles that there is yet some synne in theym that they perceyue not:  but for all these fantasyes they oughte to take noo fere nor thought but verayly thynke that it is by suggestyon of theyr ghostly enemy that wolde lette theym from rest and peas of theyr soules; and though it be so somtyme that by the meane of suche fantasyes and troubles they forgete some thynge of theyr charge whiche they ought for to haue sayd:  lette hym than be confessed yf he may, and yf he may not conuenyently and lyghtly haue his confessour:  than lette hym haue a full wyll and purpose to be confessed as soone as he can possyble, And in the meane tyme crye god mercy and with a contryte herte aske forgyuenes for his synnes / and than trust fully it is forgyuen hym; for a man is not soo redy to aske forgyuenes and mercy:  but our mercyfull lorde of his grete goodnes is moche more redy to forgyue theym.  And as to the seconde temptacyon wherby the fende wolde lette a man from his dyuyne seruyce that he is bounde vnto vtterly temptynge hym to leue it:  than ought he to be the more dylygent deuoutly &amp; reuerently with good aduysement to saye it; &amp; yf it be so he say alone his seruyce he may whan good thoughtes come or that it wyll please god with swetenes or some hye vysytacyon of the holy ghoost to vysyte and touche hym / than shall it be but well done for to stynte of his seruyce &amp; attende to that medytacyon for a tyme, and after to saye forth / soo that his seruyce that he is bounde vnto be not lefte vnsayd or vndone; and in thus doynge it shall be but lytell lettynge to his seruyce / and he shall fynde grete comforte and ease therin; For though it lette hym for the tyme:  it shall well further hym to the quyckenes of his soule an other tyme.  The thyrde temptacyon is this:  whan a man in due tyme gyueth hymselfe to honest company &amp; dysporte for the strength and comforte of his soule / and the fende putteth in his mynde his synnes tofore done and that he synneth in vayne spendynge the tyme; for all suche temptacions gyue ye no charge for it is the ghostly enemy that so tempteth and troubleth you; For neuertheles ye may be sure that all thynge whiche is truly grounded in god pleaseth his goodnes &amp; nothynge offendeth hym.  Wherfore all goddes seruauntes must grounde them fastely in god / and do by the counseyle of holy chyrche / and yf they soo doo they shall neuer be deceyued / and therfore a man that

And all this the cruell enemy dooth by the meane of puttynge them in a false drede and blynde conscyence that he bryngeth them to.  But the remedy of these and all other temptacyons is to be gouerned by theyr confessour or some other dyscrete persone / and fully put them to theyr rule as afore is sayd and nothynge folowe theyr owne blynde conscyence; For yf they folowe theyr owne conscyence it were a grete pryde / in that he wolde holde his owne wytte better than the true counseyle of holy chyrche.

He whyll that his specyall chosen chyldren be vertuously and well taught in theyr soules / and yf they doo a defaute he wyll knocke them on theyr hedes with some wordes of dyscomforte and dyspleasure / and yf they doo a greter faute he wyll gyue them a buffet with grete sharpenes in sondry maners after the dyuerse condycyon of the defautes / and yf they doo a moche greter trespas than he chastyseth theym moche more sharpely. And all this our blessyd lord doth for the specyall loue he hath vnto vs / for as he sayth hymselfe:  them that he loueth / them he chastyseth.  Now truly, and we toke good hede of these wordes we wolde be gladder of his chastysynge than of all this worldes cherysshynge / and yf we so dyde / all dysease and trouble sholde tourne vs to comforte and Ioye.  But it is full harde thus to doo in the tyme of sharpe heuynes whan a soule standeth naked from all ghoostly and bodely comforte, to take and fynde Ioye in dysease; al be it they that be in suche inwarde dures they must seke in all wayes how they may comforte themselfe in god / and thynke and trust fully that god sente neuer suche chastysynge but that he wolde in longe tyme or in shorte sende comforte wherby they sholde be brought out of these heuynes.  For the prophete sayth many be the trybulacyons of ryghtwysmen / and all suche god shall delyuer.  And though ye fele somtymes sterynges of [dyspayre or of] vnkyndly euyll thoughtes comforte you euer in the goodnes of god / and in the paynefull passyon that his manhode suffredde for you; for the fende tempteth many of the seruauntes of god to dysperacyon and drede of saluacyon / as well worldely men as other ghoostly lyuers / puttynge in worldely mennes myndes the greuousnesse of theyr synnes / and to the ghoostly lyuers he putteth drede &amp; strayte consyence in many more sondry wyses than I can tell:  and full gracyously god hathe comforted theym and brought theym out of theyr errours.  And now I am styred and moued for to tell you of one of them whiche was a squyer that hyght Iohn¯ Holmes.  A narracyon.  This squyer that I haue named had ben a grete synfull man / and soo at the last thorugh the beholdynge of his grete synnes, And by the temptacyon of the fende, he fell in to dyspayre, soo depely and greuously that he had nygh loste hys mynde.  And thus he was troubled forty dayes that he myght neyther slepe ne ete but wasted awaye and was in the poynte to destroye hymselfe.  But that blessyd gracyous lorde that is soo full of mercy and pyte wolde not haue hym loste.  And vpon a day as he walked in a wood alone an aungell came to hym in fourme of a man and saluted the squyer full goodly / and talked with hym in full curteys maner / sayenge vnto hym:  man thou semest to haue grete heuynes and sorowe / tell me I praye the the cause of thy dysease.  Nay sayd the squyer it is not to be tolde to the.  Yes hardely sayd the aungell / thou wotest not how well I may helpe and remoue thy dysease; For a man beynge in dyscomforte sholde alwaye dyscouer his heuynes to some
<EPB/><PB N="2: 120"/>

creature that myght ease hym / for thorugh good counseyle he myght recouer comforte and hele / or in some wyse haue remedye.  The squyer answered the aungell agayne and sayd that he wyste well he neyther coude ne myght helpe hym, And therfore he wolde not tell it to hym.  This sayd squyer wenynge alway that this aungell had ben an erthly man / and dredde that yf he had tolde it vnto hym he sholde haue sayd some worde that sholde vtterly haue greued hym more.  And whan the aungell sawe he wolde by no way tell it vnto hym / he sayd vnto the squyer in this wyse:  Now sythe thou wylte not tell me thy greue I shall tell it the.  Thou arte sayd the aungell in dyspayre of thy saluacyon: but trust me faythfully thou shalte be saued / for the mercy of god is so grete that it passeth all his werkes / and surmounteth all synnes.  It is sothe sayd the squyer, I wote wel that god is mercyfull, but he is also ryghtfull and his ryghtwysnes must nedes punysshe synne, And therfore I drede his ryghtfull Iugementes.  The aungell spake vnto hym agayne and tolde hym many grete examples how gracyous and mercyfull our lorde god is to synners.  But the squyer of whome we spake was so depely fallen in dyspayre that he coude take no comforte of ony thinge that he coude saye.  Than the aungell spake agayne to hym in this maner:  O sayd he that thou arte harde of byleue! but wylte thou haue an open shewynge that thou shalte be saued?  Than sayd he to þe squyer I haue here thre dyce that I wyll throwe / and thou shalte throwe them also / &amp; who that hath moost of the dyce sykerly shall be saued.  A sayd the squyer how myght I in this throwynge of the dyce be certayne of my saluacyon? / &amp; helde it but a Iape; / that notwithstandynge the aungell threwe the dyce and he had on euery of the dyce vpwarde the nombre of syxe.  And he than bad the squyer throwe the dyce.  O than sayd the squyer certaynly that dare I not doo / for I wote well though I caste / more than thou hast caste sholde I not cast ne haue / and yf I had lesse than sholde I fall in ferther dyscomforte. / But so specyally the aungell desyred and spake that at the last the squyer threwe the dyce / and in throwynge by the gracyous myght and power of god euery dyce deuyded in two / &amp; on euery dyce was the nombre of syxe / and so he had the double that the aungell had.  And as he was meruaylynge therupon the aungell vanysshed out of his syght / wherfore he thought veryly than it was an aungell sente from god to brynge hym out of his sorowe / and than he toke moche comforte and Ioye in the grete mercy &amp; goodnes of god in suche maner that all his dredes and sorowes were clene departed / and he became a vertous man and the very seruaunt of god / and lyued blessydly.  And whan he sholde departe from this worlde he deuysed there sholde be a stone layde vpon hym / with these wordes wryten aboute it that foloweth:  Here lyeth Iohn¯ holmes that of the mercy of god may saye a larges.  I knowe a worshypfull persone that was in the same abbey here in englonde where as he lyeth, that redde the same wordes afore sayd wryten on his tombe.  Now than sythen our mercyfull lorde god sent thus his gracyous comforte to this man that was a worldly synfull man &amp; receyued hym to grace and brought hym out of dyspayre:  There sholde noo man be dyscomforted nor dyspayre of ony temptacyons / for hardely god wyll

A meruayllous thynge: The cyte beynge in trouble / dyuerse multyplycacyon of prayers was [made] amonges the people in euery state or degree.  For truly thou myght se bothe mornynge / euenynge / and at myddaye men and women euerywhere berynge the psalter of our lady.  Cardynalles whiche be named the pyllers of the worlde and bysshoppes shamed not to bere in theyr handes &amp; at theyr gyrdelles these soo grete tokens of the godhede and of our fayth veryly to be byleued.  Truely by the myracles of our lady shewed by saynt Domynyck they doubted not but in excercysynge of this psalter goddes helpe to be redy at all tymes.  What more? All that dyde assaye this psalter perceyued some knowlege of the pyte of god. And amonges all I shall shewe this wonder or myracle onely folowynge.</P><P>At Rome was a certayne mysdysposed woman of her body, moost famouse aboue all other lyke dysposed / in beaute / eloquence / apparayle / and worldly gladnes / whiche fortuned gracyously to haue the psalter of our lady by thaduyse of holy saynt Domynyk / whiche she hydde vnder her kyrtell and sayd it many tymes on the daye.  But alas she neuertheles vsed the vnlawfull flesshely pleasure and vnclennes of her body aboue all other / more men resorted to her than to ony other woman of suche vayne dysposycyon.  This woman, named fayre Katheryne for the incomperable beaute of her body, contynued in her mysse-lyuynge / and ones on the day at the leest she dyde vysyte the chyrche sayenge the psalter of our lady / and thus was her medytacyon and thought:  The fyrst fyfty she sayd for the infancye of cryst in the whiche he bare all his passyon to come / and yf it were not at that tyme in execucyon / neuertheles it was in his entent and mynde.  The seconde fyfty she sayd for crystes passyon exhybyte and done ryally lyke as he suffred in his manhode.  The thyrde fyfty she sayd for the passyon of cryste as it was in his godhede / not bycause the godhede as the godhede myght suffre / but bycause this infynyte godhede loued so moche the nature of man / that yf it had ben mortall it sholde haue suffred deth; Therfore bycause the eternall wysdome of god in hymselfe myght not dye for vs / he toke vpon hym our manhode / whiche his wyll was sholde suffre passyon &amp; dye for all mankynde.  And as this fayre Katheryne thus contynued in prayenge / it happened on a season as she wente aboute Rome wandrynge after her olde

maner / a meruayllous fayre man mette her &amp; sayd:  Heyle Katheryne / why stondest thou here / hast thou noo dwellynge place?  To whome she answered sayenge:  Syr I haue a dwellynge place and euery thynge in it ordered to the best and goodlyest maner.  To whome he sayd:  This nyghte wyll I soupe with the.  She answered:  I graunt with all myne herte / and what so euer thou wylte haue I shall gladly prepare.  Thus goynge hande in hande they came vnto her hous where as were many wenches of lyke dysposycyon.  Souper was prepared and this vnknowen geste sate with fayre Katheryne / the one dranke to the other.  But euery thynge that this straunge geste touched / were it drynke or other thynge lyke / anone turned in to blody colour, with a meruayllous excellent smell &amp; swete sauour.  She meruaylynge sayd to hym:  Syr what arte thou / eyther it is not well with me elles thou arter very meruaylous / for euery thinge that thou touchest is anone made of blody colour.  And he answered sayenge:  Knowest thou not that a crysten man neyther eteth nor drynketh but that is dyed or coloured with the blode of cryste.  Thus this woman was meruayllously abasshed of this straunger / soo moche that she fered for to touche hym.  Notwithstondynge she sayd:  Syr I well perceyue by your countenaunce that ye be a man of grete reuerence:  I beseche you who be ye / and from whens come ye?  To whome he sayd:  Whan we be togyder in thy chaumbre / I shall shewe the all thyn askynges.  And thus lefte in doubte of the mater: she made redy the chaumbre.  This woman Katheryne wente fyrst to bedde / &amp; desyred the straunger to come to bedde to her.  A wonderful thynge and suche one as in maner neuer was herde of ony creature:  Sodeynly this straunger chaunged hymselfe in to the shappe of a lytell chylde / bare vpon his heed a crowne of thorne / vpon his sholder a crosse / and tokens of his passyon with innumerable woundes vpon all his body / and sayd vnto Katheryne:  O Katheryne now leue thy folysshenes.  Beholde / now thou seest the passyon of Cryste veryly as it was in his infancye for the whiche thou sayd the fyrst fyfty of thy psalter.  I shewe vnto the / that from the fyrste houre of my concepcyon vnto my deth I bare contynually this payne in myne herte / whiche for thy sake was soo grete that yf euery lytell pece or stone of grauell in þe see were a chylde and euery one of them had as moche payne as euer suffred al the men in the worlde at theyr deth: yet all they togyder suffre not so grete payne as I suffred for the.  This woman was sore abasshed seynge and herynge this wonder.  And anone agayne he was tourned in to the lykenes of a man, euen after the same fourme whiche he had the tyme of his passyon ryall, And sayde:  Doughter beholde now thou seest how grete paynes I suffered for the / whiche dooth excede all the paynes of helle / for my power of suffrynge is of god and not of man.  And my passyon was so grete that yf it had ben deuyded amonge all creatures of the worlde / they sholde all haue dyed or ben dystroyed.  After this sey[i]nge he chaunged hymselfe in to the clerenes of the sonne / notwithstandynge the tokens of his passyon remaynynge also gloryously/ in all his woundes were sene al and infynyte creatures of the worlde for compassyon of the same / and he sayd vnto her:</P><EPB/><PB N="2: 126"/><P>BEholde / take hede / now thou seest what I suffred in my godhede for thyn helth; syth all thynges be in me and I in euery thynge / in all these I se the / I loue the / &amp; in them all I am redy to suffre eternally the payne for thy soules helth whiche thou seest, for my loue is infynyte (after saynt Dyonyse) and all thynges in me be infynyte as the same Dyonyse sheweth.  Therfore knowe the mekenes of god / and call to mynde the threfolde passyon of cryste / for the whiche thou sayd thryse fyfty Aues / &amp; fyftene Pater nosters, And here after amende thyselfe / that as thou were before the example of all malyce and vnclene lyuynge / soo now from this tyme forwarde [þou] lyue in suche maner that thou may be to all other a myrrour of purete and clennes.  I do not appere to the for thy merytes but onely for an example of penaunce / and bycause thy brethren and systers of myn vndefyled moders fraternyte haue prayed for the / that by thy conuersacyon many sholde be conuerted and be the chyldren of god / lyke as before innumerable were made the chyldren of the deuyll by thy wyckednes.</P><P>What more?  This vysyon vanysshed awaye.  It was also vnfayned / for the woman afterwarde felte in her handes and fete the sorowe of crystes passyon / and in other partes of her body.  Therfore she rose from synne &amp; toke her to penaunce / and on the morowe after made her confessyon to saynt Domynyk; to whome he enioyned in penaunce to saye the psalter of the blessyd vyrgyn Marye as she was wonte to doo, and to be one of her fraternyte / whyche she had not before in dede but onely in purpose and entent as it is afore sayd; where it is to be noted how moche this sayd fraternyte is worth to them whiche haue it in dede / syth it was soo grete valure to this woman hauynge it but in purpose. [&amp;] whyles that she prayed deuoutely vnto this vyrgyn Marye / the same blessyd lady appered to her with saynt Katheryne, sayenge to her:  Doughter beholde / take hede / thou hast synned moche: therfore thou must suffre grete penaunce; for this cause take in penaunce euery daye thre dyscyplynes or thre correccyons / wherof euery one shall be of .lv. strokes whiche make a penytencyall psalter. She sayd also / it shall not alwaye nede to haue a rodde / but prycke the with thy nayles / or pynche thy flesshe in euery place.  Thou mayst at all tymes doo this penaunce ayenst euery wycked temptacyon and for to obteyne all goodnes / and this is a royall, preuy penaunce and naturall, It may be called the quene of all penaunces.  This woman herde all these wordes and fulfylled them in dede. And as she was thus dayly penytent: vpon a tyme saynt Domynyk auaunced by the power of god sawe in the nyght a wonderfull thynge to all the worlde.  He perceyued that from the hous of this same Katheryne yssued out .lv. flodes from the membres of a lytell chyld / ewhiche flodes descended to hell, in whose comynge the soules, there to be purged, were gretely comforted.  O how grete and Ioyfull noyses made they than: how many blessynge gaue they vnto this sayd Katheryne; veryly the erth sounded agayne to theyr voyces for Ioye.  There were soules delyuered / comforted / made hole &amp; excluded from theyr paynes, by the medytacyon that Katheryne had of crystes passyon in his chyldehode.  She was alwaye aboute to applye it to the comforte of all true crysten soules departed out of this worlde.  O meruaylous thynge:  After this saynt Domynyk sawe a man entre

in to Katheryns chaumbre / &amp; from .v. [woundes] of his body yssewed out .lv. [fountaynes] whiche nourysshed and watred all the chyrche mylytante / and also this present worlde; trees and plantes dyde burgyn / byrdes and fysshes were quyckened / true crysten people were bathed in those flodes.  O how grete swetenes was there and how grete worldly gladnes.  All creatures blessyd this woman Katheryne and prayed for her to almyghty god maker of all thynges. And these two meruaylles were shewed for the fyrst fyfty and the seconde.  And where as this penytent Katheryne began the thyrde fyfty of her psalter, Saynt Domynyk sawe a meruaylous grete gyaunt clerer than the lyght / of whome yssewed out fyue fountaynes / of the fyue fountaynes sprange fyfty flodes whiche neyther descended to therth / nor to hell / but meruayllously ascended togyder vnto heuen, And by them all heuenly paradyse was watred.  Theyr swetenes was so grete that the aungelles and holy sayntes dyde drynke of theym / gyuynge grete thankes to almyghty god.  Whan saynt Domynyck sawe all these meruaylles as Thomas of the temple wryteth: he meruaylled gretly why they sholde be shewed and done in the hous of so grete a synner.  To whome marye the vyrgyn appered and sayd:  O my frende Domynyk why doost thou meruayle in suche causes? Knowest thou not I am a frende to all synners and that the mekenes of god is in me?  It was my wyll to shewe these vysyons to the of this my doughter that thou sholde preche them to the worlde / for this entent that no crysten persone be theyr synnes neuer so grete sholde dyspayre in ony condycyon / but alwaye trust in god and his mercy / and namely they that wyll flee vnder my proteccyon with this woman Katheryne.  The holy vyrgyn and martyr saynt Katheryne socoured her very moche whiche alwaye she loued and serued with some prayer from her yonge aege / for the congruence of the name.  More ouer the blessyd moder of god sayd:  O Domynyk thou haste sene these meruaylles:  Here now and preche that I soo holy and meke shall saye.  Shewe that I haue purchased of my sone to all suche as sayth my psalter and are of my fraternyte / they shall haue the same excellence whiche the sayd Katheryne hath.  &amp; though they can not se it in this worlde, lykewyse as men can not se god / his aungelles / the deuylles / neyther theyr merytes and vertues in this lyfe, Also they can not se the vertue of a precyous stone nor of the sterres: therfore the knowledge of heuenly thynges must be moche ferther from them; Notwithstondynge they shall beholde this excellence after theyr deth.  Therfore Domynyk be of good comforte [&amp;] preche my psalter &amp; my fraternyte / for vnto all suche as hath them I haue purchased not onely to se this excellence / but also to haue it eternally in possessyon.  What sholde I saye more?  Saynt Domynyk gaue thankes to almyghty god for his grete mercy.  And this Katheryne made herselfe a recluse [&amp;] she dystrybuted her goddes to the poore people.  Whiche afterwarde was of so grete holynes that many very holy persones came vnto her bycause of her godly reuelacyons.  To whome appered our lorde Ihesu .C. dayes &amp; fyfty before her departynge out of this lyfe shewynge the tyme of her deth / whiche afterwarde departed out of this lyfe very holy.

Vpone þis seiþe seint Gregor: Yf euery fortune is for to be drad, moch more is for to be drad prosperite þan aduersite—as scheweþ opynly.  And note wel þat god ordeyneth all þingis in tribulacion to [þe] delyueraunce of his seruauntis, as he behotiþe be þe prophet Dauid, seying þus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Cum ipso sum in tribulacione, eripiam eum &amp; glorificabo eum,</FOREIGN> I am with hym in tribulacion, I schal delyuer hym of tribulacion, and I schal glorifye hym for tribulacion.  For als much þan as god is with vs in tribulacion, we schal suffre it paciently and gladly, for þe more þat tribulacion groweth to þe, the more nere god neiȝhith to þe, as þe prophet seith:<FOREIGN LANG="LAT"> Iuxta est dominus hijs qui tribulato sunt corde, &amp; humiles spiritu saluabit,</FOREIGN> Oure lord is faste-by to hem þat ben in tribulacion of herte, and he schal saue hem þat ben meke of spirite.  Therfor if the peyne of tribulacion make the heuy and greuyth the, þe myȝt and the mercy of god thy sauioure þat is with the in tribulacion, schall inwardly comfort the.  But now perauenture þou myȝtest answere &amp; sey thus: 'The bitter payne ofe tribulacion I fele wel, but swettnesse of his fellowshyp I fele none; ffor if he schewed to me the present swetnesse of hy[s] myrth as he doth the bitternesse of tribulacion, I schuld suffer it gladly'.  Also perauenture thow woldist seye that afore tribulacion thow felist more swetnesse in god þan þou dedist whan þou were in tribulacion.  Here-to may be answered, þat þe frendshipe of god in tribulacion is vnder-stond in twey maners.  First: as tribulacion encresith, so god multiplieth grace &amp; vertu for to suffre tribulacion paciently &amp; gladly.  Example: as lordis send socoure and helpe to comforte hyr seruauntis þat be in castellis besegid of her enemyes, ryȝt so oure lord god sendiþe comfort of grace to soules þat ben be-segid with temptacions &amp; tribulacions.  The secund maner of the fellowschype of god in tribulacion may be vnderstonde by the comforte þat he sendith hem þat bene in tribulacion; as the apostil seithe, I Cor. IIo: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Sicut habundant passiones Christi in nobis, ita habundat consolacio nostra,</FOREIGN> As the passion of Criste encresith in us, so encresith oure comforte.  Cristis passions encresyne in us when thei be sent fro hym and we to [þe] lyknesse of hym mekely &amp; paciently suffer hem as goddis seruauntis, and not as mansleers and thevis, whiche hane deseruid þat þei sufferne.  And vnderstond well, þat comforte of grace in tribulacion is for he schulde dred god and trist in hym to be delyuerde; as we rede in the boke of holy fader seint Anton, how he after many gret spirituall temptacions was troublyd of fendis, bodyly betone and woundid all hys body, so þat whan his seruaunt cam to viset hym he found hyme lying dede &amp; so he toke hym vp and bare hym to the next towne where he watched tyll abowȝt mydnyȝt; and þan by the will ofe god he releued and bad his seruaunt preuyly, all other sclepyng, bere hym aȝen; and so he did.  And whan he was brouȝt ayen thedir so feble þat he myȝt not stonde, but sittynge vp he seid þus: 'Where bene ye euill spiritis, wicked feendis? lo I am here be þe myȝt of god redy to withstond all youre malice'.  &amp; after þes and many [othir] wonderfull temptacions: oure lord appered to hym in wonderful lyȝt &amp; comfortable.  To whom hooly Antone seid: 'A lord Ihesu, where hast þou bene? good lord, where hast þou be so longe fro me in tribulacion?'  And oure lord answered and seyd: 'here with the, beholdynge thi fyghtynge, redy to reward the and comforte the after thi uictory, as I am wont to do for my chosin childerne'.  For wit þou well þat comforte oweth not to com, tyl that a place be rayed therto by tribulacion.  Also we rede of Sare, the

The comforte of on oure passith þe sorrowes of tribulacion of many ȝeris; ffor god þat commyth for to helpe &amp; comforte, after tribulacion schal abyd with þe, gladdynge þi soule.  And perauenture yf þou pleineste þe þat þou tarrieste ouer-longe abydynge his comforte, as louers be wont to pleyne: here-to answeriþe a gret clerke, Cassiodorus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Ipsa uelocitas dei desideranti &amp; amanti tarditas videtur,</FOREIGN> The swiftenesse of god to a desirynge &amp; a louynge soule semyth longe tariynge, [or thus: a thyng þat is moche couetyd semeth grete tariyng] to a louynge soule.

Note well þat þere is no perell in tribulacion of temptacions so þat þou answere not to hem by dilectacion or consentynge, as þe spech of ane opyne cursed man noyeth not but yf þou answere to hym.  þat is figured in holy wrytt where it is seyd, Ysaie XXXVIo: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Mandauerat enim rex Eȝechias ne populus responderet blasfemijs Rapsacis,</FOREIGN> Kynge Eȝechie commaunded þat þe peple schuld not answere to the blasfemis of that tiraunt

But it is to wit þat ther bene v. maner of materiall purgyngis.  On is purgynge of mannys body for corrupcion of humoris wicked; &amp; þat is in two maners: one ys be medicinable drynkys, a nother be crafty blood-lettynge.  The secund purgynge ys of metal, as gold be þe fire, &amp; iron be the fyle.  The thrid purgynge is of trees, as cuttynge of vynes, and voydynge of onfrutfull branches.  The fourth purgynge is of corne, as betyng or thresshyng with a flayle.  The fyfte purgynge is of grapis, &amp; that is by a pressoure.  One þus many maners god doth purge the soule by tribulacions.  For as the body is purged by medicinalle drinkis of euell humoris, ryght so is the soule made clene by tribulacions sent from the souereyne leche oure lord god of veyne affeccions and euell maners; for seynt Gregor seyth:<FOREIGN LANG="LAT"> Mali humores sunt mali mores,</FOREIGN> Euel humoris bene euel maners.  Drinke þis medicyne of tribulacion sent to the fro god, for he is a wise leche and knoweth all þi preuy syknesse &amp; how much þou maist suffre and how much þou nediste, for he sendiþe the no thynge but þat þat is profitable to the.  And he haþe tasted and assayed and drunke afore the, not for hym-selfe but for þi purgynge, he suffred þe passione of deth; wherof he seyd to the apostellis Iohn¯ and Iamys, Mat. xxo: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Potestis bibere calicem quem ego bibiturus sum,</FOREIGN> Mow ye drynke þe passione þat I schal drynke?  Þan sith this wise lech hath dronke this medicyn for þi loue, drynke þou therof with-oute drede, for it is holsom.  This drynke thirsted the prophet Dauid whene he seid: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Calicem salutaris accipiam et nomen domini inuocabo,</FOREIGN> I schal take the holsome passione of tribulacion.  And if þe þinke it bitter, clepe þi lord god vnto þi helpe as he seid: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Da nobis domine auxilium de tribulacione,</FOREIGN> Lord god graunt us helpe of tribulacion.  And as a purgacion schuld be receyued hastyly with-oute ouer-much tastynge or longe tarryng, so schuld tribulacion be acceptid wilfullye with-out argumentis of disputynge or rebellyone or grucchynge.  But now be wel ware: for as some-tyme þe prophet of the medicyne is letti[d] and worchith the contrary to corrupcion, not for the defaute of þe medcyne, but for þe euel disposicion of hym þat receyueth hit, so in the same wise the prophet of tribulacion is lettid of purgacion and doth the contrary, for it is begynnynge of payne, after which foloweth euerlastynge dampnacion; as we reden of kyng Pharo kynge of Egipt, for the more þat he was visettid by tribulacion, the more his rebellious herte encresyd in to his dampnacion.  The secund purgacion of mannys body for euel humoris is by crafty blood-lettynge, and that is of two maners, as by openynge [of þe veyne, or els by boxynge or ventusynge.  Openynge of the veyne] is properyd to confession, and boxynge or ventusyng, to tribulacion.  And not[e] wele, ryght as foule blode corruptith the body, so syn which is called in holy writ 'blood' defouleth the soule.  The veyne be the which blod or syne ys voidid oute, is the mouth, as it is seyd Prouerb. x: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Vena vite os iusti; quia iustus in principio accusator est sui,</FOREIGN> The mouth of a ryȝtful man is the veyne of lijf; for the ryghfull man in the begynnynge accuseth hym-selfe, þat is to sey, be confession.  Also note that as a man oweth by this veyne to voyde oute wicked blood for the purgynge of his body, and kepe his good blood for his norisshynge, ryght so in confession he oweth by his mouthe to shew all his synnes, and with-hold and kepe preue all his good dedis for fere of lesynge; for good [dedis] schewed in
<EPB/><PB N="2: 395"/>

confession by veyneglory or avauntynge, turnyn fro vertu vnto vicis for defaute of wise kepyng, as we redyne of the pharase that seyd, Luc.  XVIIIo:<FOREIGN LANG="LAT"> Gracias ago tibi domine quia non sum sicut ceteri hominum, raptores, adulteri, uelut eciam hic publicanus; Ieiuno bis in sabbato, decimas do omnium que possideo:</FOREIGN> Lord I þanke þe for I am not lyke as other men, robbers and auoutrers, also not lyke this publycan; I fast twise in a weke, I paye tythes of all þat I haue.  Lo here þou maist vnderstond by this pharase a false feyned and a prowd confession.  <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Sed publicanus a longe stans noluit oculos ad celum leuare, sed percuciebat pectus [suum] dicens Deus propicius esto michi peccatori:</FOREIGN> But the publican stondynge a-ferre behynde, holdynge hym-selfe vnworthi, wold not lyfte up his ȝien to heuen, but he smote his herte and seyde God haue merci on me synner; and so this publican yode thens iustified, or made ryght, by his verry meke confessione.  To this acordith the prophet Dauid where he seith thus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Dixi confitebor aduersum me iniusticiam meam domino, &amp; tu remisisti impietatem peccati mei:</FOREIGN> I schall knowlege [by] meke confession ayence my-silfe to my lord myn vnryȝtwisnes, and þou haste forȝeuen the wickidnesse of my synne.  ¶ Boxynge or ventusyng, a-cordyth to tribulacion; for als many desesis as god sendith to the in tribulacion, so many remedies he ordeynith for thi purgacion.  But note wel as it is nedeful afore ventusynge, the flessh to be het and clensid, for þan the smytynge of the blood-yryne may be suffred the more esily; so it is spedful afore tribulacion þat the hert be hett with parfite loue and charite, þat temptacion of tribulacion may be suffred the more paciently and gladly.  In figure here-of the holygoste cam downe to the apostilys in lyknesse of fire, bi whome thei were so strengthid and comforted þat afterward þei werene gladd and yedyn Ioyinge for þei were maade worthi to suffer tribulacion, angre and repreue for the name of Ihesu, the which afore þat tyme were so dredful þat þei fleddyn aweye fro hym and som forsokun [hym], as Petir—þat was prince of the apostilles—for fere of a woman swore þat he knew hym not, the which after [þe] commynge of the holygoste dred not the cruell turment of Nero the emperour, but paciently and gladly suffred to be crucified and dede.  The secund maner of materyall purgacion is of metallis, as gold be fyre, and irone by file.  For ryght as fire departith gold from other metallis, and purgith hym of ruste and fylth, and makiþe hire faire and clene: so tribulacion departith the soule of his aduersaries, and clensith hym of the filth of synnes, and it makith hym to god lovely and acceptable; and therfor it is seyd Sapienc.  Vo: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Tamquam aurum in fornace probauit electos dominus, et quasi holocausta hostii accepit illos, &amp; in tempore erit respectus illorum,</FOREIGN> Oure lord hath preued his chosen men by tribulacion as gold is preued in the fornaise, and he hath accepted hem as sacrifice of offrynge, &amp; in tyme of reward þat schuld be hold(!).  With this fire of tribulacion was Iob preved when he seyd, Iobe XXIIIo: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Probauit me deus sicut aurum quod per ignem transit,</FOREIGN> God preuith—by tribulacion—me as gold þat passith by fire.  And note þat amonge all metallis gold is moste preciouse, and leed is leste of price, &amp; yet neuertheles gold is not purged with-oute leed, for leed draweth with hym in the forneis the filthes of gold.  On the same maner chosine soules [the whiche be likned to gold], bene purged by dampned soules the which be likened to leed; wherof Salomon seith: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Stultus seruiet sapienti,</FOREIGN> The fole schal serue to the wise man—þat is to seye, euell men schal serue to purge good men by tribulacion.  ¶ Also Iron is purged bi the file of ruste, and made schynyng and bryȝt: so is the soule purged by tribulacion from vnclennesse &amp; comforted with gostly lyȝt.  And as a knyfe þat is not vsed, abydynge in the sheth draweth ruste: so doth the soule with-oute excersise of tribulacion, desireth vnclene luste; as we redyne of Dauid, IIo Reg. IIo, [þat] whan he was with-owt tribulacion of werrynge with his enemyes, fell into auoutrye with the wife of Vry þat worþi knyȝt, &amp; after into homicide or manslauȝter.  Þerfor seiþe þe prophet Ieremye: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Fertilis erat Moab in diebus adolescencie sue, &amp; requieuit in [fecibus] suis:</FOREIGN>

Moab, þe which is vnderstonde the son of my people, was plenteuous by grace in tyme of his tribulacion, and he hath rested in filthes of syn.

The secund temptacion is disperacion, þe which is a-yenst hope &amp; confidence þat euery good man schuld haue vnto god; for when a sike man ys turmentid sore &amp; vexid with sorow &amp; siknesse of his body, þan þe deuell is most besiest to superad (or put-vpone) sorrow to sorrow, with all þe weyes þat he may obiectynge his synnes ayence hym for to induce hym into dispeire.  Forthermore, as Innocente þe pope in his þrid boke of þe wrecchidnesse of mankynd seiþe: Euery man boþe good &amp; euell, er his soule pas out of his body, he seith Crist put in þe crosse, the good man to his consolacion, the euell man to his confusion, to make hym aschamyd þat he hath lost þe frute of his redempcion.  Also, the deuell bryngith aȝen to mannys mynde that is in poynt of deth, specialli the synnes that he hath don &amp; was not schreven of, to draw hym þerbye vnto dispaire.  But þerfor ther schuld no man dispaire in no wyse; for þough eny o man or woman had do als many theftis or manslauters or as many other synnes as be droppis of water in the see &amp; grauell-stones in the stronde, though he neuer had do pennaunce for hem afore ne neuer had bene shreven of hem afore, neither þan myȝt haue no tyme for syknesse or lacke of spech or schortnesse of tyme to be shreuen of hem, yette schuld he neuer dispeire; ffor in such a cas verry contricion of herte with-in, with wyll to be schreven if tyme sufficed, is sufficient &amp; acceptable to god for to [s]aue hym with euerlastyngly; as the prophet witnessith in the psalme: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Cor contritum &amp; humiliatum<EPB/><PB N="2: 410"/>

Þerfor no mane schulde dispaire, þouȝe it were so &amp; it were possible þat he alone had don all maner of synnes þat myȝt be done in þe world; for be dispaire a man gettith nouȝt ellys but þat god is moch more offendid þerby, &amp; all his oþer synnes bene more greuouse in goddis syȝt, &amp; euerlastyng payne is therby augmentyd infinitlye to hym þat so dispaireth.  Therfor a-yence dispeire for to induce hym þat is syke &amp; laborith in his dying to verry trust &amp; confidence þat he schuld principally haue to god at that tyme, the disposicion of Criste in the crosse schuld grettly draw hym, of the which seynt Bernard seith thus: What man is it þat schuld not be rauysshed &amp; draw to hope &amp; to haue full confidence in god, &amp; he take heed diligently of the disposicione of Cristis body in the crosse; take heed &amp; see his heed enclyned to salue the, his mouth to kysse the, his armes I-spred to be-clyp the, his hondis I-thrilled to yeue the, his syde opened to loue the, hys body alonge strauȝt to yeue all hym-selfe to the.  Therfor no man schuld dispeire [of] foryevenesse, but fully haue hope &amp; confidence in god; for the vertu of hope is gretly commendable &amp; of gret merite before god, as the apostill seith &amp; exortith us: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Nolite amittere confidenciam vestram, que magnam habet remuneracionem,</FOREIGN> Lesith not youre hope &amp; confidence in god, þe which hath gret reward of god.  Forthermore þat no synfull man schuld in no wyse dispeire haue he synned neuer so gretly ne neuer so sore ne neuer so ofte, ne neuer so longe contynued therin, we haue [open] ensample [in] Peter þat denyed Crist, in Poule þat pursued holy chirch, in Matheu &amp; Ȝache the publicanes, in Mary Maudeleyne the synful woman, in the woman þat was takyn in avoutry, in the thefe þat honge on the crosse be-sid Crist, in Mary Egipciane, &amp; vnnomberable oþer greuouce &amp; grete synners.  The thrid temptacion is in-pacience, the which is ayenst charite bi the which we be bounden to loue gode above all þingis: for þei þat bene in syknesse in her deth-bed suffren passyngly gret payne &amp; sorrow &amp; woo, &amp; namly they þat dyen not be nature &amp; course of age þat hapynneth ryght selde as [open] experience scheweth all daye to euery mane, but dyen oft-tymes thorow an accidentall seknesse, as a fever, a posteme &amp; such other greuous &amp; paynfull &amp; long seknes, the which many men, &amp; namly hem the which bene vndisposed to dye &amp; dyen ayenst her wyll, &amp; lackene verry charite, makyth so inpacyent &amp; grucchynge, þat other-while thorow woo &amp; inpacience þei be-com wood &amp; witles, [as] it hath ofte be seyen in many men; &amp; so be þat it is open &amp; certeyne þat þey þat dyen in þat wyse faylen &amp; lac verry charite, wittnessynge seynt Ierome þat seith þus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Si quis cum dolore egritudinem uel mortem suscipit, signum est quod deum sufficienter non diligit,</FOREIGN> that is to seye: Who so takyth syknesse [or deth] with sorrow &amp; displesaunce of herte, it is ane open sygne þat he louyth not god sufficiently.  Therfor a man þat wyll dey well, yt is nedfull þat he gruche not in no maner of seknesse þat fallyth to hym be-fore his deth or in hys dyinge, be yt neuer so paynefull or greuouse, longe tyme or schort tyme durynge; for as seynt Gregory witnessith in his Morallys: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Iusta sunt [cuncta] que patimur, et ideo valde iniustum est si de iusta passione murmuremus:</FOREIGN> All þingis þat we suffren we suffyr ryghtfully, &amp; þerfor we ben vnryȝtfull yf we grucch of þat we suffer ryȝtfully.

be pacience mannys soule is trewly had and kept, so be vnpacience &amp; murmuracion it is loste &amp; dampned, wittnessyng seynt Gregory in his omely þat seith þus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Regnum celorum nullus murmurans accipit, nullus qui accipit murmurare potest,</FOREIGN> Ther schal no man haue þe kyngdom of heuen þat grucchit[h] &amp; is inpacient, and ther may no man gruch þat hath it.  But as þe gret clerke Albert seyth, spekyng of verry contricion: [If] a verry contrite man offerryth hym-selfe gladly to all maner affliccion of seknesse &amp; ponysshynge of his synnes, þat he may therby satisfye god worthyly for his offensis: moch more [þan] schuld euery sike man suffer paciently &amp; gladly his owen seknesse a-lone, þat is lyȝter withoute comparison þan many syknessis þat other men suffer; namlye sythen þat siknes be-fore a mannys deþe is as a purgatory to hym whan þat it is suffred as it ought, þat is to vnderstonde, yf it be suffred pacientlye &amp; gladly, with a fre [kynd] wyll of herte.  For as the same clerke Albert seyth: we hane neede to haue a free kynd wyll to god not only in such þingis as bene to oure [consolacion, but also in such þingis as bene to oure] affliccion.  [And] seynt Gregor seyth: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Diuina dispensacione agitur ut prolixiori vicio prolixior egritudo adhibeatur,</FOREIGN> It is do by the dispensacion &amp; þe ryȝtfull ordynacion of god þat to the lenger syn is ordeyned the lenger siknesse.  &amp; þerfor lett euery sykman &amp; namely he þat schall dye, sey as seynt Austen dyd to god: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Hic seca, hic vre, ut ineternum michi parcas,</FOREIGN> Here cutt, here brenn, so þat þou spare me euerlastynglye.  And seynt Gregor seith: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Misericors deus temporalem adhibe[t] seueritatem, ne eternam inferat vlcionem,</FOREIGN> God þat is mercyfull yeveth his chosyn children temporall ponysshyngis here, lest he yeve hem euerlastyng vengeaunce ellys-where.  This temptacion of inpacience fyȝtteth ayenst charite, &amp; with-oute charite may no man be saued; &amp; therfor, as seith seynt Poule: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Caritas [vera] paciens est, omnia suffert,</FOREIGN> Verry charite ys paciente &amp; suffreth all þingis.  &amp; in þes wordis yt is notably to be marked þat he spake of suffryng of all þingis, &amp; oute-take noþing: þan schuld all syknesse of the body [bi reson] be suffred paciently without murmuracion or difficulte; and therfor seynt Austen seith: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Amanti nichil difficile uel impossible,</FOREIGN> To hym þat loueth ther is no þinge hard ne no þinge impossible.  The IIII<HI1 REND="sup">th</HI1> temptacion is complacens or plesaunce of a man þat he hath in hym-selfe, þat is spiritual prid, with the which þe devyll temptyth &amp; vexith most relygiouse &amp; deuoute &amp; parfite men; for when þe deuel seth þat he may not brynge a man oute of þe feiþe, ne may not induce hym vnto dispaire, ne into impaciens: þan he assaileth hym be complacens of hymselfe, puttyng such maner of temptacions in his herte: O how stable arte þou in þe feiþe, how stronge in hope, how sad in pacience!  O how many good dedis hast þou do! &amp; such oþer þouȝttis.  But ayenst þese temptacions Isodur seith thus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Non te arroges, non te iactes, non te [insolenter] extollas vel de te presumas, nichil boni tibi tribuas,</FOREIGN> Ne bost þe not, ne vaunte þe not proudly, ne make not moch of thi-selfe wantonly, neþer adiecte no goodnesse to þi-selfe.  For a man may haue so much delectacion in such [maner of complacens] of hym-selfe þat a man schuld be dampnyd euerlastyngly þerfor.  And þerfor seynt Gregor seith: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Quis reminiscendo bona que gescit dum se apud se erigit, apud auctorem humilitatis cadit:</FOREIGN> A man þat þinkeþe in good dedis þat he hath do &amp; is proud therof of hym-selfe, he fallith down anon þerfor be-for hym þat is auctor of meknes.  &amp; þerfor he þat schall dye most be ware when he felith hym temptid with pride, þat þan he low &amp; meke hym-selfe, þinkinge in his synnes &amp; þat he wit neuer wheþer he be worþi loue or hate, þat is to sey saluacion or dampnacion.  Neuerthelesse, lest he dispayre, he mote lyfte vp his herte to god by hope, þenkynge &amp; remembrynge stably þat þe mercy of god is above all þinge &amp; all his werkis, &amp; þat god [þat] is trewe in all his wordis, &amp; þat is treuþe &amp; ryȝtwysnes þat nether begileþe neþer is begiled, be-hight &amp; swor by hym-selfe &amp; seid by the prophet: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Viuo ego, dicit dominus,<EPB/><PB N="2: 412"/>

nolo mortem peccatoris,</FOREIGN> God all-myȝti seith: be my lyfe, I will not the deth noþer the dampnacion of no synner or of no synfull man, but þat he conuerte hym-selfe to me &amp; be saued.  Euery man schuld followe seynt Antonye to whome the deuell seyd:  'Antony, þou hast ouercom me, ffor when I wold haue the vp by pride, þou kepist þi-selfe a-downe by meknesse, &amp; whan I wold draw þe downe by disperacion þou kepist þi-selfe vp by hope';—thus schuld euery man do both seke &amp; hole, &amp; þan ys the deuell ouer-com.  The V<HI1 REND="sup">th</HI1> temptacion þat temptith &amp; greuyth most carnall men &amp; seculer men, [is] ouer-much occupacion &amp; besynesse a-bouȝt outward temporall þingis [as her wyfes, her children, her carnall frendes, and wordely riches and other þingis] þat þei hane loued inordinatly before.  For he þat will dey wyll &amp; surely, most vtterly &amp; fully put oute of hys mynde all temporall &amp; outward þingis, &amp; plenerly commytt hym-selfe all to god. &amp; þerfor the gret clerke Duns (Scotus) seith þus vpon the fourth boke of Sentence:  What man þat is seke whan he seth þat he schall dey, If he put hys wyll þerto to dey wilfully &amp; consentith fully into deth as þouȝe he had chosyn hym-selfe [þ]e payne of þe deth voluntaryly, &amp; so suffreth deth paciently, he satisfyeth to god for all his veniall synnes, and forthermore he takyth aweye a parcel of satisfaccion þat he oweth to do for dedly synnes.  &amp; þerfor it is ryght profitable &amp; necessarye in such a poynte [of] nede þat a man conforme his will to goddis will in all þingis [as] euery man owȝt both seke &amp; hole.  but seld it is seyne þat any seculer &amp; carnall man or relygiouse man [other] will dispose hym-selfe to deth, other ferthermore, þat is wors, will here ony þinge of the mater of deth þouȝe in-dede he be laborynge faste to his ende-ward, hopynge þat he schall escape þe deth—&amp; þat is [þe] most perlous þinge &amp; most inconuenient þat may be in eny cristen man, as seith the worthy clerke Cantor parisiensis.  But it is to be noted well þat the deuell in all þe temptacions above-seid may compell no man, [neither] in no maner of wyse prevayle ayenst hym to consent to hym, als long as a man hath the vse of reason with hym, but if he woll wilfully consent to hym,—þat euery good cristen man &amp; also euery synful man be he neuer so grete a synner owȝt to be were of aboue all thyngis.

And yeff thow do thus, thow shalt be gladde, for the prophete seyth that 'the meke and the mylde suffryng trybulacions in rygthwysnes for goddys loue, shullene ioye'.  Therfore meke the with ale thy mygth, bothe inwarde with herte thynkyng, and owtewarde with goode dedis werkyng, so that other mowe be conuertede by thy goode example yeuyng, and thane shalt thow haue grace, off synnes forgyfnes and to encrese in vertew, and so to come to endeles blysse that mane was ordeynede to in hys furst creacion.</P><P>Stirop.

Also [for] noo wrathe nere vnpacience for sekenes, or for losse off gode, ne losse of name, ne for no vysytacion that gode sendeth the, other sufferyng the fende to vexe the by temptacions, or by vexacion off thy euene-crystene, late nat thy horse caste the owte of thy sadylle off pacience; but sytte sadly and streyne thy ffeete in thy styroppys by the vertew [of] gostely strengthe, and doo as Cryste byddeth in the gospelle where he seyeth thus: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">In paciencia uestra possidebitis animas uestras,</FOREIGN> that ys: Ye shullene kepe your soulys in youre pacience.  And thane lyke as the sadylle maketh the horse semely and lusty to the eye off mane, so pacience and mekenesse makis the soule louely and amyable in goddys sygth, semely and gracyous in mannys sygth, euylle and confusyously in the fendys sygth. And there-ayenst wratthe and impacience, hastynesse and hygh fulnes in herte makyne a mane vngracyous ande hatefulle in goddys sygth, sporte and gladnes to alle the deuylles in helle, and increasyn the peynes that neuer shalle haue ende. Off thys sadylle oure lorde spake to Cayne whane he was wroth with hys brothere Abelle: 'Why, seyde oure lorde, art thow wroth, and why ys thy face and thy chere so fallene?' — for he was fallene owte of the sadylle of pacience in to the foule pytt of wretthe; 'for yeff thow doo welle, thow shalt resceue off me godde mede, and yeff thou do euylle, anone thy synne cometh to the yate, to be punysshede; but the desyre off synne shalle be vnder the and thy powere, [as] the horse vnder hys master, ande thow shalt be lorde thereoff yff thou wylle, Genes. 4<HI1 REND="sup">o</HI1>, And so Cayn be mysgouernaunce off hys horse felle owte off the sadylle off pacience in to manslawghtere off hys brothere, be-cause he consentede to the wyckede desyres off hys flessh and wolde nat restreyne hym by the knotte off dyscrecion.

By thys tree I vnderstande mankynde that came off Adam ande Eue; by thys byrde I vnderstande euery crystene mane and womane; the whyche whane they be furst borne off here modere, be dede by orygynalle synne and nat able to the lyff off grace ne to blysse, for seynt Powle se[i]th: 'we be alle borne chyldrene off wrathe': but assone as we falle in to the fonte-stone and in watere off bapteme bene baptyȝede, anone we resceyue the lyff off grace and bene able to the blysse thate mane was ordeynede to in hys furst creacion, yeff we kepe vs fro the floode off syne.

Ryghte so hit ys nat Inowh to rewle thy body, but also thow must arme the with gostly armure to withstande the dyntis off the dartis off the deuyllis foundyng, for seynt Powle seyth Ad Eph. 6: Alle oure fyghtynge ys ayenst wyckyde spyrytes off derkenes, that ben prynces and gouernoures off synfulle mene.  'And therfore, he byddeth, arme yow in gostly armure off gode, so that ye mowe withstande the busshementis and the sleyghtis off the fende, and to stande stedefastly and parfytely in alle thyngis off ryghtwysnes.

Thus Seynt Powle by lykenes off bodyly armoure techyth vs gostely armure.  He byddyth yow arme yowre body by the vertew off trouthe that ys callede the Habergeoun off Ryghtwysnes; he byddeth you do ryghte to alle and yelde to gode that longeth to hyme, to youre euyncrystene that longeth to hem, bothe to youre sufferaynes and to youre felawes and to youre subgettis, and to hem that be passede owte off thys worlde with almesdede doyng and yeldyng off dettis, and to hem that bene to come in sauyng off her ryghte inherytaunce.

And thane taketh with youe the speare of Crystis passyone.  Furst taketh hede how hys hede was crownede with a croune off thorne that went in to hys brayne, &amp; the bloode brestyng oute one euery syde, to dystroye the hygh synne off pryde.  For lyke as the hede ys hyghest and most worthy of the vtter partes off mane, so pryde ys worst off alle synnes and most vnworthy in the sygth off gode.  Take hede how hys armes were spredde abrode and drawene ffulle strayte in the tre tylle alle the synewes and veynes brestyne a-sondre, and hys hondys smytene thorowe with raggede nayles to the tre, and how grete stremes off bloode ranne owte, to dystroye the synne of wyckede werkes that mane doth with hys wykede handes.  Take hede how hys syde was openede ande hys herte clovyne a-two with a sharpe spere, and how he shadde owte both bloode and water, the whyche [shewed] that yef he had hade more bloode, more he wolde haue yeuene for mannys soule to the fader of heuene; and water, to wasshe vs frome oure synne.  Also he suffrede thys to dystroye pryde, couetyse, enuye, hate, wratthe and malyce, that renneth most in mannes herte and womans.  Take hede how hys feete were naylede to the tree streynyng oute bloode, to dystroye the synne of slouthe in goddys seruyce and in the VII dedys of mercy doyng.  Take hede how hys body was alle for-rente and alle to-tore with scharpe scourgis that frome the sole off the fote to the top off the hede there was noone hoolle place, and that was to dystroy the synne of lust and lechery that reygneth in mannes body &amp; womans.  Take hede how nakede and pore he hynge vpone the tree, to dystroye the synne of couetyse and wordely worschyppe.  Take heede how he dranke eyselle and galle, to dystroye the synne of glotonye.  And so he suffrede payne in alle partyes of hys gloryous body, to dystroye alle synne[s] in mannys [body] and womans.  Thys spere of Crystis passyone ys the best and sykerest wepyne ayenst oure enemyes.

And therfore seynt Powle techeth yow stonde [fast] in trowthe and equyte, that in alle youre doyng ye loke that youre grounde and youre cause be god and trewe, rygthfulle, clere and clene fro couetyse.  And a wyse knygth wylle haue with hym the hylle and the sonne and the wynde.

Also ye muste haue a peyre of sporys, the whyche muste be sharpe to pryke with youre horse yef nede be, that he stynte nat in hys weye, ffor many horsys be dulle and slowe in theyre iorney but they be pryked.  These sporys shalle be loue and drede of gode, whyche among al othere vertues displesyne most the fende and sonnest bryngeth a mane or woman to heuyne-blysse.</P><P>Rigth spore.  The rygth spore ys loue that mane oweth to god for the grete and excellent goodnesse that he [hath] shewed and sheweth at alle tymes.  Furst how he made man off noughte to hys gloryous lykenes, and made hyme lorde of alle erthely thyngys; and for that excellent loue þat he schewed to mankynde in hys mercyffulle redempcion; and for the vysytacions that he sheweth to you cotydyally bothe in sparyng yow fro endeles peynes off helle, and yeveth yow space and grace and tyme to amende yeff ye wolle, for Cryst seyth <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Nolo mortem peccatoris sed ut magis conuertatur et viuat,</FOREIGN> that ys: 'I wylle nat the dethe of a synnere but rathere more that he turne therfro and lyue'.  Also he yeueth goodys plenteuosly that bene necessary and profytabely to yow, yef they be gouernede dyscretely; and so sheweth yow alle-wey grete tokenes off loue and mercy.</P><P>Lefte spore.  The lefte spore ys dreede off paynes of helle and of purgatory that be Innumerable eyther to be thougth or seyd or tolde.  Now with thyse II sporys pryke youre horse yeff he be dulle and euylle-wylde to goodnes-warde. Furst with the ryghte spore that ys loue; and yeff he wolle nat haste hym in hys iorney, than pryke hyme with the lefte spore, that wylle make hym to sprynge yef he be in the wey off grace.  In thys manere, lyfe frendis, arme yow in thys gostly armure and myghteth yow in thys gostly batayle, and gouerne youre horse, that ys youre body, dyscretly, so that hit be nat ouer-feble by ouermeche abstynence and trauayle, ne to wylde by ouermoche ease and fulfyllyng of hys appetyte as in glotony or in lechery or in any other vngoodly desyres, for in case wykede lustes and desyres mowene be dedely synne, as thus: yeff thow luste to medle with womane or mane ayenst the lawe off gode and thow dost alle that lyeth in the to performe hitt in dede yeff thow myghtest, thane hit ys dedely synne.  Dauyd seyth that 'god knoweth and preueth mannes herte and hys leendys', that ys to sey, god knoweth mannes wylle and hys lustys, for there ys no thyng so pryuey neyther in thoughte ne in dede but that ys opyn in goddys syghte. Therfor suche as a mane ys in herte and in wylle, suche he ys by-fore gode.</P><P>Also a wysemane, or he goo to batayle, wol knowe for what cause he shalle fyghte and whethere that hit be trewe, ande what shalle be hys rewarde; and yef hit be sygnede in two thyngis hym to chese, thane he wolle sende hys most belouede and trusty frende to see and enquere whyche ys best and most confortable.  In the same wyse muste ye in thys gostely batayle.

Also thy rewarde ys assygnede in two thyngis, to chese the best as longe as thou trauaylyng arte in thys batayle, but be thow onys hynnes went, thow mayst not do soo, for [to] whether so thov furst comest, lyke hit the welle or euylle, there the be-houeth to dwelle for euermore; shalt thow neuer after thys dwellyng chaunge, syt itt neuer so euylle with the.

Wherfor my counselle ys that thow departe thy soule frome thy body by inwarde thoughte; and to sende thy herte, whyche ys [thy] most louyde and trusty frende, before, to wete off that two thyngis whyche ys moste profytable to abyde in.  Sende thyne herte in to helle and ther shalt thou fynde [all] that that thou ha[te]st here, that ys a fawte off alle goodys, and plente off alle euylles: hote ffyre brynnyng with-outyne lyghte, with brymstone moste stynkyng; foule stormes and tempestis; gredy deuylles as wode lyones wyde yellyng; hunger ande thryst that neuer shalle be quenchede; adders, toodys ande alle venemos wormes [þat] one the synfulle shullene gnawe; wepyng, gronyng ande gryntyng off tethe; fulle off derkenes; smoke and smother, þat shalle make hem to wepe mo teerys glowyng thane ys water in the see; eueryche hatyng other as the deuylle most horryble, and euer cursyng the tyme that they were borne, and euer desyryng dethe.  And so they be euer dying but neuer ffulle dede, but shul lyue euer in payne, woo and turment.  They hatedene dethe whane they lyuedene in lustis ande lykyngis of this worlde and fulfyllede here flesshly appetytys and wolde not restreyne hym by the brydylle off abstynence, in holdyng the reynes of temperaunce by the knotte off dyscrecion.  Also the soules that shalle be there must be dyrke ande dymme, hydously stynkyng and lothsome to see; for the bodyes off heme shulle be so febylle and so chargede with synne that they ne shalle [mow] remeve the lest worme frome no party off theyre body, but must suffre alle here malyce, and yet nat only heme, but alle the paynes, woo ande tormentis that herte may nat thynke ne tonge may nat telle, for they shal haue noo mynde off no goode to theyre comforte, but euer in payne lyche newe.

Also haue mynde off thy[s] place that ys so horryble and so paynfulle, and forsake syne whyles gode suffreth the to lyue ande hast helthe ande thy wyttes at wylle; for Salomone seyth: 'In alle thy werkes thynke one thy ende, ande thou shalt neuer doo syne'.  Thynke that thou shalt dye and thow wottest neuer where ne whene ne what dethe, ne in what state ne in what daye ne what tyme; ande therfore seyth seynt Austyn¯ that euer shulde oure last day be in oure mynde, for whene þou rysest thow arte nat sykere to [liue to euen, ne when thou gost to thi bed thou art nat syker to] ryse with thy lyfe.

Certes, thys day oweth sore to be dredde, for as moche mercy as oure lorde sheweth nowe to mankynde, so moche shalle thane be shewede streyte vengeable ryghtwysnes; for oure lorde seyth by hys prophete Moyes: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Congregabo super eos mala et sagittas meas complebo in eis,</FOREIGN> 'I shal hepe vpone hem theyre euylles, and I shalle spende alle my arowes vpone heme'.  Thre sharpe arowes shalle be shotte off oure lorde in that day vpone hem that shullen be dampnede.  The furst arowe shalle be off clepyng to the dome, whereof Cryst seyth in the gospelle: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Venit hora ut omnes qui in monumentis sunt audient uocem filii dei, &amp; procedent hii qui bona egerunt in resurreccionem uite, qui uero mala egerunt in resurreccionem iudicii,</FOREIGN> that ys: 'the oure cometh in the whyche alle mene that bene deed in beryelles shulle here [the] voyce off goddys sone, and they that hane done goode thyngis shullene gone in to ayene-rysyng off lyff, but they that hane doo euylle thyngis in to ayene-rysyng off dome', that ys to say, to be demede.  Than the dampnable soule shalle come to the body and sey to hit: 'Aryse, thou cursyd caytyff [careyne], from thys tyme forwarde to be felaw with the horryble fendis in helle and enemy to almyghty gode.

Thane shullene alle wykede mene se the iust cause of theyre dampnacion wretyne with theyre owyne handes in the booke of theyre conscyence, whyche booke both lernede and lewde shullene kunne rede.

Ande yet hit ys as þe modere seyth.  But were the chylde onys owte off prysone, and se the myrthe, welthe ande welfare that she spake off, he wolde be fulle sory to go ayene in to prysone there to lyfe with hys modere; ffor alle hys lyf in prisone, whyche was furst lykyng Inowgh to hym, shalle thane be to hyme fulle bytter and paynfulle, and therto he shulde neuer haue ioye ne reste in herte tylle he were ageyn in that welffare whyche he sawe oute of prisone.

her gostly moder, holy chyrche, ande her gostely ffader gode hym-self, fader off alle, telle hem the blysse ande the wellfare whyche ys in the blysse off heuyne, hit ys to theyme but a dreme as the tale off the moder ys to the chylde in prysone, that they hane noo sade feyth theryne.  And tryste itt fully, though they beleue nat that hit ys so as oure moder holy chyrche tellyth, howe ther ys in this worlde but stynke ande horrybylyte and a foule dongeone in comparysone of that heuynly blysse, yet hit ys so as her gostly fader seyth, ande nat the lese for her mysbeleue.  Neuer-the-lese take hit for certeyne that they shalle neuer haue parte neyther ffelyng of that blysse, but they wol beleue ande trust fully that hit ys so as theyre modere holy chyrche telleth.  Wherfore withdrawe youre hertis from erthely thyngis and sette [not] youre loue to moche one youre erthely moder, ne truste her nat, for though she speke neuer so fayre and behote yow neuer so welle, she ys false ande wolle dysceyue yow at the last.  For she fareth as the nykare or meremaydene, that cast opone the water syde dyuerse thyngis whyche semene fayre and gloryous to mane, but anone as he taketh hit ande weneth to be sure theroff, anone she taketh hyme ande deuoureth hym.  Ryghte so thyne erthely moder casteth oute fayre ande gloryous thyngis to thy syghte, she casteth oute grete rychesse and worldely goodys ande worshyppes ande flesshly lustis, whyche bene fastnede to the rope off hope of longe lyff, and assone as thow towchest heme, that ys to say as sone as thow desyrest heme and laborest with alle thy myghte, with alle thyne herte and with alle thyne thoughtis to haue heme, anone she draweth the rope off longe lyfe, that ys, she seyth 'thow arte yonge and may lyue longe, ande therfor laboure to haue goodys ande gete the worschypp, that thow mayst lyue esyly in thyne age.  And thow lyue in lechery, in glotony, in pryde, in extorsyone or in any wrongfulle takynge, whene thou comest to age than shalt thow mowe doo grete almes, and so by prayers off pore men shalt thow haue foryeuenesse'; and so thorow hope off longe lyfe ande of other mennes prayers thowh thou lyue stylle in synne, [she] wylle take ande deuoure the in the fyre off helle.  And therfor trust her nat; but set thy trust, thyne hope, thyne loue in thy gostly moder that ys to beauteuouse and trust[i] to be-leue opone hyr, for she seyth nowthere behotyth but that shalle be performede, yeff thou wolt obey to here byddyngis.  For yeff thou haddest felt ore seyne the lest blysse that ys in heuyne, thene alle the ioyes and lykyngis that thow hast in thys worlde of erthely thyngis, shalle thane be to the grete bytternes, sorowe ande care.  Example haue we off seynt Petyr whom Cryst ladde opone the hylle off Thabor with Iohne ande Iames, and ther he schewede but a lytylle off [the] blysse of hys manhode, whyche was hys face shynyng as the sonne, hys clothys were whyte as snowe, ande Moyses ande Helyas apperede with hyme in grete blysse ande in grete mageste.  Than Petyr seyde vnto oure lorde Ihesu: Lorde, hit ys good to vs to be here, and make we thre tabernacles, on to the, another to Moyses, and another to Hely, and late us allewey dwelle here', and so anone in the syghte of that lytelle blys in comparysone off the blys that ys in heuyne, he forgatte alle the blysse off thys worlde, for he carede neythere for mete ne drynke ne for clothyng; hym thoughte he myghte haue lyuede there withoutyne ende by that blysfulle syghte, Luc. 9o.

For to huyde me it schal be impossible, and for to appere it schal bee vnsuffrable. I schal seeche where to huyde me, but nowhere fynde it; me schal agrise to appere, and euere i. schal be present.

Who is he þat is cleped þe aungel of greet counseil, þe whiche is cleped sauyour, þat i may crye on his naame?  Ceertes, it is Ihesu, he him-self is þe iuge whom i. dreede so soore.

Forȝet now Ihesu þis proude trespassour, and bihold with mercy þis wrecche clepyng þi naame, Thy sweete naame, Thy delitable naame, Naame of comfort to synneres and of blessede hope.  For what is Ihesu to seie but 'sauyour'?  Therfore Ihesu, for þin owene self be to me Ihesu.  Thow þat maadest me, lat me nouȝt perisschen.  Thow þat bouȝtest me, lat me not be dampned. Thow þat maadest me þorwe þi goodnesse, lat me not perisschen þoruȝ my wykkednesse.   And as þow art þe mooste mercyful, suffre not my wykkednesse to leese þat þin al-myȝty goodnesse hath maade.  Mercyful Ihesu, i. biseche þee know þat þin is, and wipe it a-wey þat is ootheres.  Ihesu, Ihesu, haue mercy whiles tyme is of mercy, þat þow dampne not in tyme of þi doom.  For what profit schalle be to þee in my bloode, ȝef i. schal descende in to euerlastynge corrupcion?  'For dampnede men schullen noone preise þee, ne eny of þoo þat goon down in to helle'.  ȝef þow wolt suffre me lord entre in to þe broode bosum of þi mercy, it schal neuere bee þe streiter for me.  Receyue me þerfore, moost desirable Ihesu, Receyue me with-inne þe noumbre of þin chosyn; so þat i. bee fed in þee with hem, and preise þee with hem, and þat i. withouten eend ioye in þee, with alle þoo þat louen þi name.
