The Rev. H. E. Salter, by collation of the original Oseney deeds as well as of the Registers, has solved the problem of the section and identified its names. The 'charter,' he points out, must have been invented after 1191, by tacking together several grants of earlier and later dates, without the least attempt to make them fit in with each other. The charter, by its witnesses, professes to be of date 1149, but Robert Doyly II died seven years before that. The bishop of Lincoln at the foundation of Oseney was Alexander, not Robert. The constructor of the charter may have taken the name Robert either from Alexander's predecessor, Robert Bloet (1093-1123), who during his episcopate seems to have granted a confirmation-charter to St. George's church; or from Alexander's successor, Robert de Chesnei (1147-68), who in 1149 sanctioned the grant, by Henry Doyly I, of St. George's church and its possessions to Oseney. The deed makes Oseney in 1149 possessed of Frees chapel, which in fact was the gift of Thomas of St. Walery about 1191; and of the tithes of Twycross and Warton obtained in 1187-9 by an exchange, which is fully described in the Oseney Cartulary. The list of places is confused by the jumbling together of names taken from different confirmations. Thus, the scribe gives both Perieth and Woodperry, but they are probably the same; so also, probably, Leyes and Northlye; Asshe and Tenesse; Cawdewell (Caldewell) and Goldwell.]</NOTE1></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="AHA2740.0001.001:6.3.3" TYPE="item" N="22"><HEAD>[22.] A confirmacion off Geffrey of Iuory þe sone of Roger of Iuory off þe Same yifte. </HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>About 1100.

Still, since it is distinctly brought up in these documents, the facts may be briefly set down. (A) Between Oxford Castle and the site of Oseney stands St. Thomas' parish church, now, and for long back, the mother church of the west suburbs of Oxford: see Map at beginning of Wood's <HI1 REND="i">City of Oxford</HI1>, ii. (B) No. 66 describes the founding of a chapel near the gate of Oseney. Were (A) and (B) separate or the same? What were the date and occasion of their foundation and refoundation, or dates and occasions of their foundations? Oseney tradition, set out in no. 63, may at once be dismissed. Could a church have been built, on the sudden inroad of war into Oxford west suburb, between Sept. and Dec. 20, 1142? Could a church have even been begun, almost within bow-shot of a hotly-besieged castle? The most probable solution of the difficulty is to take nos. 64 and 66 together, and no. 65 as referring to a distinct building. In no. 65 we have the grant by the diocesan of a semi|domestic chapel, apparently within Oseney island, probably destroyed at the dis|solution. After Oseney, in 1152, obtained possession of St. George's in the Castle (no. 23), the abbey may reasonably be supposed to have provided a more convenient church for its large parish in the west suburb of Oxford. This would account for the Church of St. Thomas the Martyr, which seems to be implied in no. 66.]</NOTE1></DIV3><DIV3 NODE="AHA2740.0001.001:6.6.2" TYPE="item" N="64"><EPB/><PB REF="00000135.tif" SEQ="00000135" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNS" CNF="999" N="67"/><HEAD>[64.]</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>About 1180.

In 1214, the town submitted and agreed to pay a sum yearly to the University through St. Frides|wyde's and Oseney; changed in 1219, to through Einsham.
