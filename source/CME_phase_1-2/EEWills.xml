CHALLENOR SMITH, ESQ.,</NAME><LB/>SUPERINTENDENT OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR LITERARY ENQUIRY, IN THE REGISTRY OF THE COURT OF PROBATE, SOMERSET HOUSE, LONDON.</SALUTE><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER><P>You will remember how the Wills in this little volume came to be copied.</P><P>You had, and have, in the Probate Court those twenty-eight Boxes of <HI1 REND="i">Inventories</HI1> of Testators' goods which the Executors and Administrators of our Forefathers were bound to exhibit to the former Officers of the Archbp. of Canterbury.  Among these Inventories we Shakspereans always hoped to find those of SHAKSPERE and his fellows, and all other Worthies of the great Eliza's reign.  And since I first saw the Boxes and their contents at Doctors' Commons some dozen years ago, I always meant to have a turn at them.  Opportunity at length being favourable, I got leave in the spring of 1881, from the kind and enlightend Judge and Chief of your Court, Sir James Hannen, to test these Inventories, and see whether Shakspere's was likely to be among them.  If it was, I intended to get money from the Treasury or by subscription, for making and printing a Calendar of these documents.</P><P>The Inventories could of course only be handled by an Officer of the Probate Court; and on you was put the dusty,<EPB/><PB N="ix"/>dirty, and tiresome job of diving into, and picking out from, all parts of the twenty-eight Boxes, samples of the little and big rolld-up Inventories that each contained; then unrolling them, and showing them to me.  The work lasted for four months.</P><P>The kindness and patience that you exhibited in this wearisome and annoying task,—which yielded such a poor result,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS1">About 3 per cent. of the Inventories were of the 15th and 16th centuries; the rest were all after 1660.  Not one of Shakspere's time turnd up, tho' that of his granddaughter's surviving husband, Sir John Barnard, was found.  I've printed it for the New Shakspere Society.</NOTE1>—and the knowledge of men, of places, and things which you displayd, won my warm admiration and gratitude.</P><P>You laid me under further obligation by telling me all the earliest English Wills in the Registry, of which you had long before made a list, in the faith that I, or some grubber of like kind, would turn up and ask where he should go to work.</P><P>Whenever, then, you were prevented, by other official calls and attending to other searchers, from unrolling dirty little bundles of Inventories for me, I—with your help in difficult bits—copied the Wills you told me of; and here they are in print, dedicated, by Sir James Hannen's leave,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS2">He will not of course see this Dedication till a copy of this little volume is sent him.</NOTE1>to you, an Officer of whom he and his whole Court may well be proud. I but speak the opinion of the late Colonel Chester—the best authority in the world—as well as of every other frequenter of your Room, when I say that you are an admirable Head of your Department, courteous, helpful, learned, and efficient.</P><P>Would that I could say that Department was in a state worthy of you, your Chief, Sir James, and the Royal Court of Probate of England.</P><P>You have in that Court, Wills needful for the family and<EPB/><PB N="x"/>social history of England.  There are many men and women wishing to work at them.  What does the Treasury give you for the purpose?  One underground and badly-lighted room in which only 6 folk can work at once.  The consequence is, that, with your many applicants, you can often give a worker only 3 or 2 days a week for his work, and he cannot go regularly in for it.</P><P>The Manuscript room at the British Museum is bad enough; but your Enquiry room is far worse.  If only Sir James had the old power of torture, and could apply thumbscrews or racks to all the Lords of the Treasury—I'd let the First Lord off, tho—he would soon set matters to rights, and give you a room worthy of your Department and his Court. But the Museum is now building a proper MS. room.  And so I trust the Treasury will speedily follow suit at Somerset House; put you up a handsome Library for your workers, make you a Keeper, with the Museum-Keepers' salary, and then let you compile and print a Catalog of the Inventories.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS3">There are of course no end of other Wills and Documents in the Registry that need calendaring or cataloging.  The Treasury is in no way alive to the urgent wants of this Office or the Record Office.</NOTE1></P><P>Again thanking you heartily for your help and kindness, and wishing you happiness and health,</P><CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Very truly yours,<NAME>F. J. FURNIVALL.</NAME></SIGNED><ADDRESS><ADDRLINE>3, St. George's Square, Primrose Hill, N.W.</ADDRLINE></ADDRESS><DATE>December 4, 1882.</DATE></CLOSER></DIV1><EPB/><PB N="xi"/><DIV1 NODE="EEWills:3" TYPE="Forewords"><HEAD>FOREWORDS.</HEAD><P>BOTH for the Life and Language of our old-time folk, their Wills hav always been acknowledgd as most worthful.  They let you into the state of every home.  They uze words not found in books. Since our Society first started, I always hoped that some one would copy and edit us a volume of Wills; but as no one offerd, and as I got a chance of transcribing one in the spring of 1881,—under the circumstances stated in the Dedication abuv,—I took it, in order to hav a volume wherewith a gap in the Society's issues could be fild up when need should be.  The need came this autumn, and here the little Text is.</P><P>It will probably disappoint the reader, who looks, as I did, for Inventories as parts of Wills, and for long lists of traders' goods, students' MSS, and the like.  I can't claim that in this regard my short volume is up to any of the Surtees or the Camden Bury ones, or possibly Mr. H. W. King's series of Essex Wills and Inventories of Church goods, in his county Archæological Society's Transactions, of which my kind helper, Mr. J. H. Round, tells me.  But at any rate, for us Londoners ther ar details of much worth; ther is Shakspere's <HI1 REND="i">Mermaid</HI1> tavern (p. 78, l. 19) and (in a note of a Latin will given me by Mr. Challenor Smith, p. 136) ther is the first known bequest (A.D. 1420) of Chaucer's <HI1 REND="i">Canterbury Tales.</HI1><NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS4">Perhaps of his <HI1 REND="i">Boece</HI1> too.  His <HI1 REND="i">The Pore Caitiff</HI1>, a Wycliffite book, is bequeathd on p. 50, l. 18; 'Jankyn Clerk' is at 39/6; his 'Koke of London' at 94/11.</NOTE1>  These make up for a good many plows, plums, ribbons and tapes.  The volume also contains the first known notice of wher the Chapel of our Lady and St. Nicholas was situate in old St. Paul's (p. 132), and has of course many items as to old London churches, streets, signs and men, which will interest the City topografers.</P><P>In Persons, it ranges from the Countess of Warwick, the Kingmaker's mother-in-law, to a Wax-chandler's servant and many a xii <EPB/><PB N="xii"/>poorer man.  In Property, it stretches from the entail of large landed estates on sons, to a portion of one bullock for a daughter (98/11, 12), or to the gift of one sheet, or a towel-roller, an egggridiron or an old brass pot (102/5, 6), to a legatee.</P><P>Of two things, more appears in the Wills than I had expected, namely, silver plate,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS5">See the references in the List of Words; and the Acorn spoons, instead of Apostle ones.</NOTE1> and furd gowns; for the latter, polecats, martins, genets, wild cats, beaver, otter, and lamb, were prest into the service.  Of Armour there is less than I'd lookt for.</P><P>But the most surprizing and regrettable thing in these Wills is the amount of money shown to hav been wasted in vain prayers, or orders for them.  Fancy one man ordering a Million Masses to be said for his soul; another 10,000; another 4,400; another sending Pilgrims to Spain, Rome, Jerusalem, &amp;c.; for the good of his soul! I only hope some sensible Executors handed over the money to the Testators' wives and children, or the poor.</P><P>When just thru the proofs of this volume, it so happend that the Master and Fellows of Emmanuel lent me their unique copy of Phillip Stubbes's <HI1 REND="i">Motive to Good Workes</HI1>,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS6">A / Motive To / Good Workes. / Or rather, / To true Christianitie indeede. /Wherein By The / waie is shewed, how farre wee are behinde, / not onely our fore-fathers in good workes, / but also many other creatures in the endes of / our creation: with the difference betwixt / the pretenced good workes of the Antichri- / stian Papist, and the good workes / of the Christian Pro- / testant /<HI1 REND="i"> By Phillip Stubbes, Gentleman</HI1> / Mathew .5. verse 16./  Let your light so shine before men, that they / may see your workes, and glorifie your fa- / ther which is in heauen. / London, / Printed for <HI1 REND="i">Thomas Man</HI1>, dwelling in / Pater Noster rowe, at the signe / of the Talbot.  1593./  A—O in 8s.</NOTE1> 1593; (I'd reprinted in September his <HI1 REND="i">Display of Corruptions</HI1>, 1583<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS7">For the New Shakspere Society, to follow Part I of Stubbes's <HI1 REND="i">Anatomie of Abuses</HI1>, of which it is Part II.</NOTE1>;) and on opening it, came a passage which well showd the change of opinion on this Mass and Dead-prayers business in his day:—  <Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED">(p. 120) "The Papists also holde it to be a work of vnspeakable merit, for a man or woman, eyther before they dye, or else at their death, to giue the greatest (p. 121) part of their goods &amp; lands (the more, the more merite) to popish priestes, (though in the meane time, theyr wife, children, and whole familyes goe a begging all theyr lyfe long,) to Monkes, and Fryers, with the rest of that filthie generation, to the ende they may pray for them when they are dead, to saie masses, trentalls, diriges, <HI1 REND="i">de profundis</HI1>, Ladies psalters, and I can not tell what riffe raffe else for<EPB/><PB N="xiii"/>them: bearing them in hand, that their souls &amp; the soules of al their friends, parents, kindred, and aliance, shall not onely bee releeued, but also cleerely delyuered thereby out of the pains of purgatorie, which otherwise shoulde lye there broiling in firie flames seauen yeeres for euerie sinne that euer they committed in this life, either in thoght, word, or deed.  Which if it were true, (as it is most false and blasphemous) I could not blame men, though they gaue all they had, and more too, to (p. 122) the Priests.  But alasse, who seeth not the vanitie of this fonde opinion of Purgatorie?  If Masses, Diriges, trentals, de profundis, Ladies psalters, and such pelting trash, could redeeme vs from paine and punishment after this life, and place our soules in ioye and blisse, I praie you then what is left to the bloud of Christ to doo for vs? iust nothing at all.  And why died Christ, if we might haue bene redeemed by corruptible money, lands, or posessions, as the Apostles, Saint Paule and Saint Peter doe reason?  What can be more derogatorie to the death of Christ, and the efficacie of his bloud, than this?  You were not redeemed, (sayth Paul) from your sinnes, neither by golde nor siluer, but by the precious bloud of that immaculate lambe Iesus Christ.  And doeth not the apostle Iohn thunder out vnto us, 'The bloude of Iesus Christ doeth cleanse vs from all sinne.  And as for (p. 123) the ridiculous opinion of purgatory, it is so foolish a thing, that I am ashamed to bestow anie labour in confuting of it, as hauing indeede neyther ground out of the word of God (no, nor so much as one sillable sounding that waie) nor anie approued or autentike writer, excepte out of such apocryphas, as Ouid, Virgil, and other heathen Poets.  And yet for all that, the Papists haue gayned as much, (I suppose) by the broching of this frai-bugge, or scar-crow Purgatorie, since it was first hatched, as all christendome is worth besides." (See also the next 2 or 3 pages.)</Q1></P><P>Now, a good many of us think of some of Stubbes's doctrines about what he did of the Papists'.  And so the world wags.</P><P>Well: the gifts to mend bad roads and bridges, to help poor girls to marriage, and to feed and clothe the poor,<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS8">See the words Bake, Blind, Bread, Brew, Clothes, Poor, &amp;c.,  in the List below.</NOTE1> no one will quarrel with.</P><P>The Land-wills ar interesting; as showing how all the land of the kingdom was in the hands of Trustees, feoffees, to whom every buyer had his land conveyd—either solely, or jointly with himself,— to evade the rights of forfeiture, wardship, &amp;c.; of feudal lords. These feoffees (see <HI1 REND="i">List of Words</HI1>) ar constantly prayd to do their duty to the Testator, and carry out his Will, either by entailing his land on his sons, or conveying it to such folk as his Executors sell it to.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS9">It was perhaps from this connection with land, that a Seal was set to all important Wills as if they were Deeds.  Also, that one Will is cald an 'Endenture' (45/5), another a 'bok' (24/10) and so on.</NOTE1>  Executors ar likewise entreated to be faithful, as if<EPB/><PB N="xiv"/>they'd answer for their acts on the Day of Doom.  And that this injunction was often needed in early days, may be gatherd from the old saying, "Three Executors make three Thieves."

But no dog is namd in any Will. Servants often are, both men and women; and in one case a Nun is left money for looking after a testator in his sickness (54/2).  One Wife is cald her husband's most trusty friend (48/21); another has all his property left to her (Walter Newent's, p. 83); but in other cases, testators don't seem quite comfortable about their widows' future (p. 122, p. 33-4, 40).  The solemn Vow of Chastity which Widows sometimes took in presence of the Bishop and Congregation, being endued with Ring and Mantle (60/8, 25; p. 135), was new to me.  Several Testators had the good sense to order plain funerals, and to recognize that Pomp was a vanity that didn't help their souls (23/22; 49/11; 8/12; 131/2).</P><P>As to all the other subjects of bequest, are they not enterd in the List of Words and Subjects which follows that of Proper Names and Places<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS11">I can't guarantee in these, that <HI1 REND="i">u</HI1> and <HI1 REND="i">n</HI1>, <HI1 REND="i">f</HI1> and <HI1 REND="i">s</HI1>, have not been sometimes printed for one another.

Eleanor, sister of Henry III. and widow of William Earl of Pembroke (who d. 15 April, 1231), had taken this vow, but subsequently (7 Jan. 1238) married Simon de Montfort.  The vow had been taken before Edmund, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Richard, Bishop of Chichester.  The former protested against her second marriage, and the Baronage, then jealous of Simon, raised such an outcry that he had to go to Rome and pay heavily for a dispensation.  It is clear, I think, that the historians who treat of this marriage (Blaauw, Pauli, Prothero, Shirley, &amp;c.;) must have been ignorant of the technical character of Eleanor's vow, which they seem to confuse with taking the veil.
