Rossiter, then of the Working Men's College, to copy it, and add the missing bits from Caxton's print of 1484. I also offered to have the proofs of the text read with the originals by a trustworthy man; but Mr. Wright said he would read them himself. Later, Mr. Edmund Brock found several mistakes in the text, and he compiled a list of them, which we issued in a thirteen-page appendix of "Additions and Corrections." On my asking Mr. Wright why he had not carried out his promise to me to read his proofs with the MS. and Caxton, he said that he did read the first sheet with the MS. and found it so correct that he did not think it necessary to read the rest. This was too bad of him, as the Society was quite ready to pay a good reader to do this part of the Editor's work.</P><P>The book having run out of print, one of the Clarendon Press readers made in my old copy of it all the corrections noted by Mr. Brock; and the new proofs to p. 48 were read with the MS. by Miss Evelyn Fox, and the rest by me, I adding a few footnotes from the French. Instead of adding a final e for all the d̛, g̛, ℏ, ƚƚ, n̄, of the MS., these letters have been printed as they stand.</P><P> In the extracts from Caxton I have had the tagd d̛, g̛, ℏ, printed as they (in his fount) are used in his type No. 4 *, which (says Blades, ii. xxxvii) made its first appearance among Caxton's types in the autumn of 1483, when he was printing the "Confessio Amantis" and the "Knight of the Tower."

The family of our Knight appears to have been established there at least as early as that date. In the year 1200, a Landry de la Tour, lord of this place, is found engaged in a lawsuit relating to  lands; and the names of different members of the family are met with not unfrequently during the thirteenth century. M. de Montaiglon, the editor of the original text of the Knight's "Book," who has investigated this question with laborious care, considers that the father of our author was Geoffroy de la Tour, spoken of at the beginning of the fourteenth century as lord of La Tour-Landry, Bourmont, La Galonière Loroux-Bottereau, and Cornouaille, and who, under the banner of the Count of Anjou in 1336, distinguished himself by his courage in the war with the English.</P><P>    This Geoffroy de la Tour had two sons, our Geoffroy, who was the eldest, and another named Arquade, who is supposed to have been much younger than his brother. The latter, our Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry, appears from his own account to have been present at the seige of Aguillon in 1346. His name again appears in a military muster in 1363. We know that he married Jeanne de Rougé, younger daughter of Bonabes de Rougé, lord of Erval, vicomte of La Guerche, and chamberlain to the king, but we are unacquainted with the date of this marriage, though in 1371 and 1372, when he composed the following book, he must have been married a sufficient length of time to have sons and daughters of an age to require instruction of this kind.</P><EPB/><PB N="viii" ID="pb.5"/><P>The name of Geoffroy de la Tour occurs several times between the date of the compilation of his book and the end of the century. In 1378 he sent his contribution of men to the army employed in the siege of Cherbourg, but he did not serve in person on that occasion. In the document recording this fact, he is described as a knight banneret. In 1380 Geoffroy served in the war in Brittany, and we find him again in active service in the September of the year 1383. We learn from another document, that at this last date Geoffroy's first wife, Jeanné de Rougé, was still living; but she must have died within a few years afterwards, for at a subsequent date, which M. de Montaiglon places in 1389, he contracted a second marriage with Marguerite des Roches, lady of La Mothe de Pendu, the widow of Jean de Clerembault, knight. This is the latest mention of the name of our Knight which has yet been discovered among contemporary records; the date of his death is quite unknown, but it probably occurred at some period towards the end of the fourteenth century.</P><P>The descendants of Geoffrey de la Tour-Landry appear to have
    been all active in the turbulent times during which they lived, and
    through one of them the name became again rather curiously
    connected with literary history. The Knight of La Tour tells us
    that he had sons (in the plural); for at the beginning of the book
    now published he tells us in the original that he had compiled two
    books, "<FOREIGN LANG="fre">l'un pour mes filz, et l'autre pour mes filles</FOREIGN> 
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.1">"<FOREIGN LANG="fre">Et pour ce ....ay-je fait, deux livres, l'un pour mes filz, et l'autre pour mes filles pour aprendre à rommancier</FOREIGN>."—<TITLE><FOREIGN LANG="fre">Le Livre du Chevalier de la Tour</FOREIGN></TITLE>, edited by M. de Montaiglon, p. 4. "And therfor y haue made .ij. bokes, one for my sones,
 an other for my doughtres, forto lerne hem to rede."—<TITLE>The Book of the Knight</TITLE>, English translation, p. 4 of the present, volume.</NOTE1>;" and in two other passages of the present book, addressing his daughters, he
    refers to the book he had compiled for their brothers, "<FOREIGN LANG="fre">ou livre de voz frères</FOREIGN>
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.2">"<FOREIGN LANG="fre">Comme vous le trouverez plus à plain ou livre de voz frères.</FOREIGN>"—<TITLE><FOREIGN LANG="fre">Le Livre du Chev. de la Tour</FOREIGN></TITLE>, chap. lxxxix. p. 175.

Ixxxix. p. 115 of the present volume.</NOTE1>." Caxton, in his printed translation, has given us at the 
<EPB/><PB N="ix" ID="pb.6"/>

conclusion a little more precise information on the subject, when he makes the good Knight refer his daughters to the other book in the words, "as hit is reherced̛ in the booke of my two sonnes
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.3">See the present volume, p. 205.</NOTE1>."  The passage represented by these words of Caxton is not found in the known manuscripts of the French text; but we may be tolerably certain, from Caxton's known exactness, that it existed in the manuscript of which he made use, and we are justified in assuming that, at the time when Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry compiled this book, that is, in 1371, he had two sons. He has in no instance
mentioned the number of his daughters, but the manuscripts of the original text are ornamented with illuminations, and in these the Knight is always represented as attended by three daughters, for which number the illuminators had no doubt satisfactory authority. Of the history of these daughters we know very little. One of them, Marie de la Tour-Landry, married, on the 1st of November, 1391, Gilles Clerembault, the son of her father's second wife by her former husband. Marie de la Tour left no issue, and died before 1400, as in that year Gilles Clerembault married a second wife.</P><P>This intermarriage of the two families appears to have been favourite idea of Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry, and was perhaps a mere question of family interest. Charles de la Tour-Landry, who was Geoffroy's eldest son, was married first to Jeanne de Soudé, but this union appears not to have lasted long, for, after her death, Charles married in January, 1389, Jeanne Clerembault, the daughter of his step-mother, and sister of his brother-in-law. Charles de la Tour-Landry was slain at the battle of Azincourt, in October, 1415.  There is some confusion in the family history at this time, through the imperfection of the genealogies; but a 
Geoffroy de la Tour, who was at the siege of Parthenay in 1419, and a Hervé de la Tour, who served in the wars near the same period (his name occurs in 1415 and 1416), are conjectured to have been sons of the author of our book. Charles de la Tour-Landry
<EPB/><PB N="x" ID="pb.7"/>

had five sons. The name of the eldest is uncertain, but he is said to have been with his father at Azincourt, and to have died of his wounds soon after the battle. As he died childless, his brother Pontus, the second son of Charles, remained the head of the family. The three other sons, Thibaud, Raoulet, and Louis, died without children. They had at least one sister, who formed a rather high matrimonial connection.</P><P>The family appears now to have been at its greatest height of prosperity and glory.  Pontus de la Tour-Landry is cited as knight, lord of La Tour-Landry, of Bourmont, and of Loroux-Bottereau, and baron of Bouloir in the Vendômois; he appears in a record of the year 1424 as giving to the prior and convent of St. Jean of Anvers the tithe of grain in his estate of Cornouaille, and he seems to have held other considerable territories in Brittany and elsewhere. He was not unfrequently employed in public affairs, and was present at the battle of Formigrey in 1450. It is only necessary on the present occasion to say that Pontus had a daughter and a son, and that the latter, who was named Louis, had four sons, none of whom left issue; so that with them the male line of La Tour-Landry became extinct.</P><P>All the older great feudal families prided themselves on tracing their descent to the chieftains of the fabulous ages of society; and usually each of them had his family romance, which told the story of the primeval heroes of his house, and which was no doubt frequently read by his clerk or chaunted by his minstrel for the edification of his family and his guests. These formed what were called the Chansons or Romans de Geste, which were so numerous in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the period when feudalism had reached its greatest development. As feudalism was gradually falling from its original character, the composition of such family romances went out of fashion, and we know of but a small number of instances at periods subsequent to those just mentioned. Thus, at a much later date, in the latter half of the fourteenth century, the family of Lusignan gratified its pride by employing a writer
<EPB/><PB N="xi" ID="pb.8"/>

named Jean d'Arras to compile the romance of Melusine, according to which the lords of Lusignan derived their descent from the marriage of one of their great chiefs of early times with a fairy, named Melusine, who every Saturday took the form of a serpent. Pontus de la Tour-Landry was one of the very latest who imitated this example. Ambitious, probably, of rivalling the fame of the Lusignans, he appears to have employed some "clerk" like Jean d'Arras to compile the Roman de Ponthus, intending especially to glorify his own particular name. It is a romance of little merit, but appears to have been at one time rather popular, as it was often printed. Pontus is represented as having been the son of the king of Galicia and of his amours with the fair Sidonia, daughter of the king of Brittany, where part of the ancestral possessions of the lords of La Tour lay. Most of the distinguished companions of Ponthus came from this side of France,  and the first of them, and the one who figures most prominently, bears the significant name of Landry de la Tour. The scene is laid in Galicia, Brittany, and England. It is curious now chiefly as forming an incident in the literary history of the Middle Ages.</P><P>Far differently interesting is the book which the great grandfather of the real Ponthus, our Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry, compiled himself for the instruction of his daughters. Its interest
is the greater from the care its author has taken to make us
acquainted with the circumstances and feelings under which it
was composed. The good Knight had, as already stated, three
daughters, who had been left motherless, and for whose success
in the world he naturally felt anxiety. He undertook, therefore,
to write a treatise for the purpose of instructing them in all those
mental qualities which, in the fourteenth century, were looked
upon as constituting the character of a pure and perfect lady.
His care to inform his readers in all the particulars relating to the origin of his book is, indeed, quite curious. He lets us know the date when he began it, and that at which it was ended.
<EPB/><PB N="xii" ID="pb.9"/>

 He says that the idea of it came into his head as he was indulging
 in somewhat melancholy pensiveness in his garden at the close of
 the month of April in the year 1371
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.4">See p. 1 of the present volume.</NOTE1>; and we learn from two other incidental statements in the original text that it was completed in the year 1372. In the forty-ninth chapter he tells an anecdote
 which, he says, happened in the same year in which he was writing
—<FOREIGN LANG="fre">en cest an, qui est l'an mil trois cens lxxij</FOREIGN><NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.5">P. 103 of M. de Montaiglon's edition; it is omitted in the translation we here publish.</NOTE1>; and in another passage he speaks of the battle of Crécy as having taken place twenty-six years ago—<FOREIGN LANG="fre">il y a xxvj ans</FOREIGN>; which, as that battle was fought
on the 26th of August, 1346, would give us the same date of
1372. He further tells us in his introduction that he employed in compiling it two priests and two clerks
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.6">See p. 3 of the present volume.</NOTE1>, whose work appears to have consisted in collecting illustrative examples and anecdotes from different writers. Every one aquainted with medieval literature knows how general was this pratice of teaching morals
and religion through popular stories and short historical narratives.  
M. de Montaiglon has further pointed out the fact that the author
had commenced his book in the intention of following another
practice which was very popular in the literature of this period—that of composing books of instruction in verse.  He has shown that in the original the prologue was written in verse, and that the rhythm, and even in great part the rhymes of this verse, are preserved almost perfectly in writing it as prose, until nearly the end of this prologue, when the Knight suddenly tells his readers that it is his design to write it, not in verse, but in prose, that he might be able to write less diffusely, and more simply and easier to be understood:  "<FOREIGN LANG="fre">que je ne veulx point mettre en rime, ainçoys le veulz mettre en prose, pour l'abrégier et mieulx entendre</FOREIGN>," or, as our English translation expresses it, "but y wolde not sette it in ryme, but in prose, forto abregge it, and that it might be beter and more

pleinly to be understond̛
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.7">See p. 3 of the present volume.</NOTE1>." A very large proportion of the stories given by Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry are taken from the Scriptures and from the lives of saints and other similar productions; but, like other moralists of his age, he adopted the stories of the fabliaux, and the tales of the popular conteur, whenever they  seemed to suit his purpose, and in his choice he has not rejected some which were better fitted by their want of delicacy to the ears of his contemporaries than to those of modern times.   There then existed very little of refinement in word or thought, and, in the best society, both  sexes often conversed in terms and on subjects which are in strange discordance with our modern sentiments.</P><P> No doubt under the pretext of instructing his own daughters, Geoffroy's design was to write a treatise on the domestic education of women, and his plan appears to have extended still further, and to have been intended to embrace the other sex also.  We learn positively from several passages in the present book, that he had already compiled a similar book for the use of his sons, and, from the way in which he speaks of it, the compilation of this other work must have preceded the book for the instruction of his daughters by some years. "And therefor," he says at the end of his prologue, "y have made .ij. bokes, one for my sones, an other for my doughtres
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.8">See p. 205 of the present volume.</NOTE1>."  In another place, in warning his daughters against drunkenness, he says, "as ye shal finde it more pleinly in the boke of youre bretheren
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.9">See p. 115 of the present volume.</NOTE1>;" and again, at the close of the book, in Caxton's translation, the knight is made to say, "as hit is reherced in the booke of my two sonnes
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.10">See p. 4 of the present volume.</NOTE1>." At least one other allusion to this book is found in the French text; yet, strange to say, nobody has ever heard of the existence of a copy of this treatise for the instruction of the Knight's sons, nor has any trace of it ever been discovered except in the mention of it in the book of which the translation is now published.</P><EPB/><PB N="xiv" ID="pb.11"/><P> The book which Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry compiled for the instruction of his daughters, on the contrary, appears to have become extremely popular. Nearly a dozen copies of the original text are known to exist in manuscript, of which seven are in the Bibliothèque Impériale in Paris, and one in the Library of the British Museum. One or two of them date at least as far back as the beginning of the fifteenth century, and two are adorned with illuminations. In the year 1514, the first printed edition of the French text was published in Paris, by Guillaume Eustace, the king's printer. A second appeared no long time afterwards printed by the Veuve Jehan Trepperel, apparently copied from the edition of Guillaume Eustace. Both are very incorrect.</P><P>No other edition of the original text of this Book of the Knight of La Tour-Landry was printed in French until it was included in 1854 by Jannet in the series so well known as the <TITLE><FOREIGN LANG="fre">Bibliothèque Elzévirienne</FOREIGN></TITLE>. This critical edition was produced under the care of one of the well-known scholars of the medieval literature of France, M. Anatole de Montaiglon, now Secretary of the <FOREIGN LANG="fre">École des Chartes</FOREIGN>. M. de Montaiglon has given us, in a very portable and convenient form, a good and correct text, formed chiefly upon the oldest of the manuscripts preserved in the <FOREIGN LANG="fre">Bibliothèque Impériale</FOREIGN> and upon the manuscript in the British Museum (MS. Reg. 19 C vii), collated more or less with the others.  It is accompanied with notes, and with a rather elaborate introduction, to which I gladly refer my readers.</P><P>The popularity of this book soon extended to foreign lands, and it was translated into several languages. The two earliest printed translations appeared in Germany and England very nearly at. the same date. The German translation, made by a knight named Marquard vom Stein, was first printed in a folio volume at Bâle in 1493, under the title of <TITLE>Der Ritter vom Turn, von den Exempeln der Gotsforcht und Erberkeit</TITLE> (The Knight of the Tower, of Examples of Piety and Honour). It forms a large and very handsome volume, with a great number of engravings
<EPB/><PB N="xv" ID="pb.12"/>

on wood.   The Book of the Knight of the Tower seems to have taken greatly in Germany, and it went through rather numerous editions between the date of this of Bâle and the middle of the sixteenth century.  It has been reproduced much more recently, in fact so late as  1849, edited by Professor O. L. B. Wolff, as one of the Volumes of popular romances published by the bookseller Otto Wigand of Leipzig. The first edition in English, as we are informed in the colophon at the end, was translated by our first printer, William Caxton, and printed by him. He tells us himself, in this colophon, that the translation was finished on the first of June, 1483, and that the printing was completed on the last day of January, in the first year of the reign of King Richard III.  As Richard III ascended the throne on the 26th of June, 1483; as the January in which the book was printed must have followed the June in which the translation was completed; and as we know that in the reckoning of this time the days from the 1st of January to the 25th of March were considered as belonging nominally to the former year and not to the year following, it means, of course, that Caxton's translation was printed and ready for publication on the 31st of January, 1484; so that the publication of the German translation had preceded it.  I enter into these particulars merely because it has been asserted that the date of publication of Caxton's translation of the Knight of the Tower was January, 1483, and not January, 1484. It is a very singular circumstance that, although Caxton's translation of the Book appears to have been widely read in England in the sixteenth century, it was never reprinted.</P><P>There existed, however, an English translation of the Book of Geoffroy de la Tour-Landry long anterior to that of Caxton, though it was never printed. It is anonymous, and we have no
means whatever of ascertaining the name of the author, or, in fact, anything whatever of its history. It is contained in a manuscript in the Harleian collection in the British Museum (MS. Harl. No. 1764) forming a large thin volume, in double columns,
<EPB/><PB N="xvi" ID="pb.13"/>

in a good formal writing of the reign of King Henry VI, so that it is not only part of a manuscript made for a person of some rank and importance, but of a volume which no doubt contained other treatises. This translation is in many respects superior to that of Caxton. The latter is so strictly and often so nakedly literal, that in following the words Caxton has sometimes lost the sense of the original, and this is carried to such a degree that it would be easy to identify the particular manuscript which Caxton followed if it were in existence. The anonymous translation of our manuscript, on the contrary, displays much more freedom, and is more correct. This earlier translation, moreover, furnishes a far more elegant and interesting monument of the English language in the fifteenth century. It is for these reasons that I have chosen it for the text of the present volume. Unfortunately, it is an imperfect manuscript, for there are one or two lacunæ in the body of the work, and it is truncated at the end by nearly one-fifth of the whole. Under these circumstances, the only resource was to supply from Caxton's text the parts which are wanting in the inedited manuscript.</P><P>In other respects, I have endeavoured to give as good an edition of the original manuscript as I could, and I have added a few illustrative notes to such points as seemed to require explanation. In forming my text, I cannot but acknowledge with thanks the assistance I have received from the excellent transcript and collation made by William Rossiter, Esq., to whom also the reader owes the side-notes and head-lines</P><SIGNED> THOMAS WRIGHT.

wiff fouled and maymed aƚƚ her lyff, and her husbonde saide ofte

she lost his loue thorugh her ielosie and foly. And therfor here [is]

For there is one 
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.21">MS. "none."</NOTE1> withoute reson, as a man to

herte of faire speche, for sum tyme her speche is deseyuable and
venemous, by the whiche ye might cache grete blame and shame.  And so
the serpent auised her tyme, whanne Eue was from her husbonde alone,
to that entent that she might haue beter leyser to shewe and to saye
to her false deseiuable langage.  And therfor, doughtres, it is not
good to a woman to be founde alone with a man, but yef it be with her
husbonde.  But y saie not but that women shulde do worshippe to hem
that is worthi to haue it.
<EPB/><PB N="56" ID="pb.69"/>


And also a woman puttithe her worshipe in balance to ansuere and speke
to moche ; for one worde drauithe an other in, and thanne there may
scape sum worde that after may turne to harme, And she may be scorned
and mocked therfor.  For the <MILESTONE N="19/2" UNIT="fol/col"/>
secounde foly that Eue dede was, for she ansuered to lightely
with-oute bethenkinge her, whanne the deueƚƚ in the liknesse of a
serpent asked why she and her husbonde ete not of the fruit of the
tree of lyff as they ete of the other fruites, and she, with-oute
counsaile of her husbonde, helde with hym talkinge, whiche turned her
to myscheef that she ansuered, for the ansuere longed to her husbonde,
and not to her, to deuise what fruit they shuld̛ ete.  And
therfor she might haue saide, " Aske myn husbonde that questyon and
not me," and thus she might haue discharged her of her ansuere. And
the[r]for, faire doughtres, takithe ensaumple yef any requere you of
foly of ani thinge that touchithe youre worshippe, ye may saye ye
wiƚƚ wete of youre husbonde, what he wiƚƚ saye that ye
ansuere hym.  And y wolde that ye knew the ensaumple of a lady that
the prince of Aquile required of foly loue, the which, whanne he hadde
aƚƚ praied, ansuered that she wolde wete her husbondes wiƚƚ,
and geue hym an ansuere. And he saw that, and lete her be, and neuer
spake more to her of that matere.  And the prince tolde to aƚƚ
the peple that she was one of the perfit good women of aƚƚ hys
londe ; and thus the lady gate her moche worshipe that she ansuered so
the prince.  And so aught eueri good woman to lete her husbonde
ansuere and not they.  The thridde foly that Eue dede was whan she
be-thought her not aright of the defence that God had made to her
husbonde and her. For God had saide hem, yef that they ete of the
fruit, that they shuld̛ <MILESTONE N="19b/1" UNIT="fol/col"/>
deye; and therfor, whanne she ansuered and tolde not
the serpent the plaine trouthe, but saide "yef we ete of this fruit
perauenture we shuƚƚ deye," and thus she putte condicion in her
ansuere, but oure Lorde putte ther inne no condicion, nor no
perauenture.  But that worde that she saide, perauenture, made the
deueƚƚ to take fote to tempte her, and enharded hym to speke to
her, as they that herken men whanne
<EPB/><PB N="57" ID="pb.70"/>



they praie hem of foly; for her herkeninge they yeue hem corage to
speke to hem further, as Eue herkened the fende that saide, "ye may
wel ete therof, and ye shaƚƚ not deye, but ye shaƚƚ be as
faire as God,
<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.29">MS. "good."</NOTE1> and ye shaƚƚ knowe bothe good and eueƚƚ; and
the cause is that he hathe defended you the etynge of the fruit is for
ye shulde not be as faire, clere, shyning, bright, puissaunt, and as
mighti as he."  And thus Eue wende he had saide sothe, and leued hym
for couetise and faire speche.  And so done these folisshe women, that
beleuithe these fals flateres and iangelers that counsailithe hem to
foly with her faire speche, and be-hest her the whiche they holde not,
notwithstondinge sum tyme they makithe hem with thaire faire speche
consent to foly delyte, and after they finde hem self deseyued, for
whanne they haue had her wiƚƚ, they leue hem shamed and defamed
shamfully. The fourthe foly of Eue was her foly sight, and lokyng that
she kyst on the tree and fruit of lyff, the whiche God had defended
her, the whiche fruit her thought faire and delycious; and
thorugℏ her light loke she desired and was tempted to ete therof.
And thus for her lewde <MILESTONE N="19b/2" UNIT="fol/col"/>
 and
light lokinge she feƚƚ into foule plesaunce and synne.  And
therfer it is gret perile to loke lyghtly; for the wise man saithe
that the most enemy that a man hathe is the sight of the yee, the
whiche haue deceyued mani with fals leude lokinge; for there is mani
that lokitℏ soberly, stedfastly, and mildely in her fals lokes,
that women wenen that thei be fuƚƚ of thought for distresse of
loue, and it is done but to make a fals semblaunt to deseyue hem.  And
therfor, doughters, here is an ensaumple to be ware of lokes, for many
a tyme folke be deceiued there-by.  For whanne the deueƚƚ of
heƚƚ findithe folke to-gederes with suche folisshe fals lokes, he
temptithe and enflamithe, and makithe hem to faƚƚ in the foule
orible synne of lechery, thorugℏ whiche they lese bothe body and
soule. And so ye may see that this synne comithe of the lewde lokinge,
of the whiche y wolde ye knew the ensaumple of king Dauid, that for a
leude look that he kiste on Barsaba, Vriis wyff, he feƚƚ into
auowtry and fornicacion with her; and after he feƚƚ into man
slaughter, for he made slee her
<EPB/><PB N="58" ID="pb.71"/>


husbonde Vri; for the whiche God toke gret wratthe and uengeaunce on
hym and his pepiƚƚ, and aƚƚ the cause of the begynninge was
of a leude loke, as hit feƚƚ by Eue, that thorugℏ her loke she
feƚƚ into the foule and orible synne to breke Goddes
comaundeament, thorugℏ the whiche aƚƚ the worlde and her
of-spring was dede, and lost, and dampned.  And therfor, doughtres, be
ware of youre lokes, whereon ye sette hem stedfastly.  The fifthe foly
of Eue was whanne she touched the fruyte <MILESTONE N="20/1" UNIT="fol/col"/>
that God had defended, for the whiche she had be beter
that she hadde hadde none hondes.  It is a gret periƚƚ after ye
loke, for whanne that two vices be sette one eueƚƚ delite, gladly
they bringe her maister into temptacion.  And therfor the wise man
saithe that no thinge shulde be touched that may hurte the soule for
leude touchinge and handelyng steritℏ and chafithe the flesshe and the
body, and blindithe reson that shulde gouerne aƚƚ, and makithe
thanne folke faƚƚ into orible synne of luxurie.  And the wise
man saithe that a man shulde loke on his hondes and bethenke hym
thries or he touched ani thinge, to that entent that he shulde know
that he wolde not touche no thinge that shulde stere hym to synne ;
for the touchinge with honde and mouthe, as kessinge, sterithe the
blode and trobelithe the drede of God and the worshippe of this
worlde. And therfor moche synne and foly is faƚƚ by touchinge and
handelinge, as it feƚƚ by Eue, oure furst moder, that touched the
fruit of lyff.  The sixte foly that Eue dede was she ete the fruit the
whiche God had defended her; And for that dede we were deliuered
aƚƚ to the payne of dethe of heƚƚ, and straunged from gret
ioye and blisse.  For the whiche folyus dede, there is faƚƚ so
moche sorw, payne, and woo, as ye may see by holy writte; And how God
hathe and wiƚƚ ponisshe them that etithe suche delycious metes
and drinkes, with the whiche they norisshe the flesshe and the
caryoune of the body, thorugℏ the whiche also is gendered ese,
reste, and hete, and steringe of the foule delite of lechery and other
synnes.  Whi takithe thei not hede <MILESTONE N="20/2" UNIT="fol/col"/>

whiche God wiƚƚ axse hem acompte at the dredfuƚƚ day.  And
wetithe weƚƚ that synne is not aƚƚ in moche etinge, but in
the delite of sauour of the mete.  And as the wyse saietℏ, the dethe
lyeth under the delites, as the fysshe that takithe his bayte upon an
hoke. And he wenithe no thinge in it but mete, and it is an hoke
whiche takithe hym, and sleithe hym, and is his dethe.  And as the
venym and poysum ys yeuen under coloure of mete and drinke, the whiche
sleithe the man ; and thorugℏ the sauour that is take of delite of the
delicious metes the soule is perisshed and slayne by the body, as the
delite of the apiƚƚ slow Eue oure furst moder, and turned to gret
synne ; as furste to herken, and to take sodenly aqueintaunce, and to
ansuere, And after the lokinge and beholdinge, and thanne touchinge,
and cussinge and saueringe made of fals delite that Eue dede to ete
the apiƚƚ.  The seuenthe foly of Eue was for be-cause that she
beleued not that God saide to her that she shulde deye yef that she
ete of the fruit of lyff, but he sayde not that she shulde deye anone
bodely dethe, but saide that she shulde deye. And so dede she furst
that was that she disobeyed to God and feƚƚ in his yre and
indygnacion.  And after she deyed bodely dethe, that was whan she had
be longe in trauaile, And had suffered mani sorwes and payues, and was
of eueƚƚ atte ease in this worlde, as God had promised her.  And
atte the laste, after her dethe, she descended into heƚƚ, and
there she and her husbond̛ <MILESTONE N="20b/1" UNIT="fol/col"/>
and aƚƚ thaire liff was in prison vnto the tyme
that God deied on the crosse, that was .V. thousande yere and more
be-twene.  And thanne God deliuered hem, and thei that hadde serued
hym in the olde lawe, and toke oute the good and lefte the eueƚƚ,
and took the corne and lefte the straw to be brent.  Alas ! whi thenke
not they that slepithe euer in synne to this day to amende hem, not
hope lyke a fole euer to lyue, and to abide to his last ende to amende
hym? And may not they see the dethe that neighed hem from day to day,
as dothe the theef that comith in atte the dore on the backe half, and
robithe, and sleithe, and gothe his way, and no man wote whanne he
comithe ayen ; and after, the theef, whanne he hathe
<EPB/><PB N="60" ID="pb.73"/>


robbed, he gothe and comithe tiƚƚ he be spied, and thanne is take
and stroyed.  And so farithe it by the synners that euer lyuen in
synne from day to day tiƚƚ the dethe takith hem, and thanne they
knowe her synnes, as the theef dothe that can not kepe hym from goyng
and comyng, and delite hem in thifthe tiƚƚ thei be taken and
putte to dethe. And so it farithe by the synner that gothe ofte to and
from in his foule plesaunce, and delited that his synne is aperceyued,
knowe, and wist so fer forthe that thei lese her worshippe, and be
shamed and defamed, bothe of God and of aƚƚ the worlde.  And
therfor a woman shulde leue on Goddes comaundementis, and do no thinge
that he hathe defended, that is to saye that no man nor woman shulde
do no dedly synne, nor to breke her mariage,<MILESTONE N="20b/2" UNIT="fol/col"/>
nor to do none avoutri, and eueri bodi aught to
beleue that it is Goddes biddinge.  For who dothe it not with-oute
amendeinent thei he dampned in the brenninge fyre of helle amonge the
deueles withoute mercy.  The .viij. foly that Eue dede was whanne she
gaue her husbonde the apiƚƚ to ete, and praied and counselled hym
to ete therof as she dede.  And he toke and ete therof, for he wolde
not disobeie her, asid therfor thei were bothe dampned, And there lyue
to be amonge the deuelles of heƚƚ in prison and pain.  And
therfor a woman aught to be ware what she counsailithe her husbonde,
And that she bethenke her yef it be good or eueƚƚ what ende her
counsaile may turne.  And also a man aught not so moche to enclyne to
his wiff but that he shulde take hede whedir it were pereƚƚ to do
her counsaile or not.  For there be many women that rechin neuer what
fallithe of her counsayle so thaire wiƚƚ be fulfelled. For y know
a man that loued his wiff, and dede after her counsaile, for the
whiche made hym be slayne for his doing after her, the whiche was the
more harme; wherfor it had be beter that he had hadde lasse drede and
beleued her, as Adam that beleued his wyff, the whiche was dethe and
vndoyng to hym and her, and to us aƚƚ.  And therefor aƚƚ
good women aught to bethenke hem, for any foluyng of her wyƚƚ,
what counsayle they geue to her husbondes, that it turne not
<EPB/><PB N="61" ID="pb.74"/>



after hem and her husbondes to harme and shame.  For and she be wyse,
she <MILESTONE N="21/1" UNIT="fol/col"/>
aught to mesure her thought
whedir it might turne to good or eueƚƚ; for she must haue parte
with her husbonde bothe of good and eueƚƚ that fallithe, and
therfor, for loue or hate that she might haue to ani body, she aught
be ware what she counsailithe hym, as Eue dede that wolde do
eueƚƚ, that she shulde not haue counsailed her husbonde to do
eueƚƚ.  And therfor, here is an ensaumple; yef a body wiƚƚ
not don good hym selff, as fastinge and other good dedes, thei shulde
not counsaile nor enhorte an other to do eueƚƚ and synne; for,
yef thei do, they are parteners in the synne that they counsaile; that
is to saye, thei takithe and turnithe folke from her deuocion,
fastinge, almesse, pilgrymage, shewinge good ensaumple to do
weƚƚ, and to fulfeƚƚ Goddes comaundementis and the werkes of
mercy; they that lettithe it be dampned. And therfor lete no body
counsaile none other thinge that may be ayenst his sowle, for, as it
is saide before, he shaƚƚ be partable in the synne.  The
.ix. foly, and the last, that Eue dede was the grettest, for whanne
God asked her whi she had broke his comaundement, and made her
husbonde to synne, she beganne to excuse her, and saide that the
serpent hadd̛ counsailed her and made her to do it.  And so she
wende to haue lytelyd her synne, to haue charged an other, of the
whiche it semithe God was worst apaied with her thanne before; for
be-cause God sayde that the bataile shulde euer be betwene the<MILESTONE N="21/2" UNIT="fol/col"/>
deueƚƚ and her, for that
she beleuid for to haue pareiƚƚ to God, and that she passed his
comaundement, and that she beleued to do the deuelles byddinge more
thanne his that made her, And for she deseyued her husbonde by her
eueƚƚ counsaile, snd that she enforced her to excuse her of her
misdede and synne, there was bataile be-twene God, man, woman, and the
fende; for her excusacion displesed gretly God, as dothe by hem now a
dayes that confessithe hem to the preest, the whiche is in Goddes
stede, that in shryfte excusithe hem and polysshithe her synne.  And
they teƚƚ it not in as foule wise as they do it, And ar shamed to
saye it, but thei be not shamed to do it; And therfor thei be lyke
<EPB/><PB N="62" ID="pb.75"/>


Eue that wolde haue excused her.  But seint Paule saithe, who
wiƚƚ be clenly wasshe and clensid of his synne, he must teƚƚ
his synne in as foule wyse as he dothe it, or ellys he is not clensyd
of his synne.  For Seint Peter saithe that, as a theef wol be gladde

was a noble and a gret clerk, in the whiche sermon was gret
foysun of ladyes and gentilwomen, that were meruelously
arraied in diuerse and queint maners, and hadde higℏ hornes;
the whiche the holy man beganne to reproue, and yeue diuerse
ensaumples to make hem to be layde doun, as Noyis flode
that stroied the world̛ for the pride and the disguysinge that
was amonge women.  And whanne the deueƚƚ sawe hem so
disguysing and counterfetinge hem, he made hem faƚƚ into the
foule synne of lechery, that displesed so moche oure Lorde, that
he made it reyne fourti dayes and fourti nightes withoute cesing,
so that the water was hygher thanne ani thing on erthe or mountayne bi the highthe of ten cubites; and thanne aƚƚ the worlde was
drowned and perisshed, and there lefte but Noye and his wyff
and his iij sonnes and her wyfes ; and aƚƚ feƚƚ thorugℏ that
foule synne of lecherye.  And after, whanne the bisshope had
<EPB/><PB N="63" ID="pb.76"/>



shewed these ensaumples with other, he saide that the women that were
so horned were lyche to be horned snailes and hertis and vnicornes.
And also he saide by men that wered to shorte gownes and shewed her
brechis, the whiche is her shame.  And so the man with his clothes,<MILESTONE N="21b/2" UNIT="fol/col"/>
 and the woman with her hornes,
mockithe God.  And he saide they were like the hertys, that bare downe
her hedes in the smaƚƚ wode; For whanne thei come to the chirche,
and holy water be caste on hem, thei bowe downe the hede. "Y doute,"
saide the bishoppe, "that the deueƚƚ sitte not between her
hornes, and that he make hem bowe doun the hede for ferde of the holy
water."  And forsothe he tolde hem mani meruailes, and hidde no
thinge, nor of the settinge of her tyre pynnes and aray, unto that he
had made mani of hem right heuy and sori.  Aud they had so gret shame
that they bowed her hedes to the erthe, and hidde hem selff reproued
and mocked.  And there was mani of hem that yede home and neuer atyred
hem in suche array after.  For he saide that suche array was like the
attercoppe that makithe his nettes to take the flyes or thei be ware,
so the deueƚƚ makithe hem to be taken in synne with the lokinge
and sight of her tyre, the whiche makithe hym to desire and delite
foule plesaunce of the synne of lechery, as it is more pleinly
contened in the boke that is cleped the Lyff of Faderes. And he saithe
that they synned gretly that furst takithe these arrayes ; and he
saithe that they that ar most hardy to do it ar most foles.  And he
saide that aƚƚ good women aught to be aferde to take ani suche
array tiƚƚ it were take in aƚƚ the contrey, and that thei
may no lenger flee it for worldely shame, for thei that takithe suche
arrayes furst shal be with God most blamed and haue lest plesaunce and
worshippe in heuene.  And <MILESTONE N="22/1" UNIT="fol/col"/>
thus
the bisshope preched to hem diuerse ensaumples, and tolde hem an
ensaumple of ij yonge women that wolde haue hasted hem tofore her
felawes towardes a fest and a gret semble of ladies and gentilwomen,
to that entent that they and her new array and disguysing might be
furst sayne atte the fest; and therfor they yode ouer a mareys for the
nexst waye, but thei feƚƚ in the myre, and
<EPB/><PB N="64" ID="pb.77"/>


fouled al her clothes and array, and were latter atte the fest thanne
thei that held̛ the higℏ way, the whiche had her array
clene.  And the cause of this ij womenis hyenge to the festwarde was
knowen, and how thei wolde goo the shortest way for to haue shewed
furst her bereƚƚ and queint array; And thanne thei were mocked
and scorned of aƚƚ folke for her leudenesse; And folke saide that
it was wel done that thei feƚƚ in the myre, for there be suche
that wenithe to auaunce hem that hinderithe hem, for, had they holde
the higℏ waye and wered mene array, they had be as sone atte the
fest as the other ladyes and gentiƚƚ women that come the
higℏ waye.  Also the prechour tolde hem that there be diuerse
women that, and thei see a lewde woman haue a nwe guyse, they
wiƚƚ neuer leue cryeng on her husbondes vnto they haue the same,
sayeng, "Whi may not y haue suche arraye as wel as she? am not y as
weƚƚ borun as she?" but she takithe none hede of her husbonde
hathe wherwith to pay for it, or liethe in his power to maintayne it.
And thus, but she haue it, her husbonde shal neuer be in pees with
her.  And she wolde not take hede to abyde unto her neygheboures and
good wise ladies and gentilwomen haue ta<MILESTONE N="22/2" UNIT="fol/col"/>
ken up the guyse or array that she wold̛ haue.
And also the bisshope tolde hem that for suche disguysinge the worlde
was perisshed with Noieys flode.  Also he tolde how there was onis a
gentiƚƚ woman that come to a fest so straungely atyred and
queintly arraied, to haue the lokes of the pepiƚƚ, that aƚƚ
that sawe her come ranne towardes her to wonder lik as on a wilde
beste, for she was atyred with higℏ long pynnes lyke a iebet, and
so she was scorned of aƚƚ the company, and saide she bare a
galous on her hede.  And therfor it is a gret foly for ani woman to
bringe up ani newe noueltees of array ; for, yef there be one that it
plesithe, there is twenty that is therewith displesed, and scornithe
and mockith it.  And therfor the bisshope bade hem leue these
queintyses, for it is the synne of pride, and engenderithe and
kendelithe lechery, and of pride, for the whiche pride the aungeles

but the good lady hys wiff considered the gret shame that shulde haue

that there was no woman so hardy that durst aforce her selff, for she

of hem that were vnreproued, that they shulde with gret disworship be

of ij knigthes that were in that tyme, whiche were
called Sir Raoul de Luge &amp; Sir Piere de Luge, and they were bothe
bretheren and knightes of gret worshippe, the whiche as in tho dayes
desire[d] to do armes and sought worship in straunge cuntreies, and

herde teƚƚ, the said Sir Piere de Luge, he was atte the feste
where as were gret foyson of lordes, ladies, knightes, and squieres
and gentilwomen; and so there come in a yonge squier before hem that
was sette atte dyner, and salued the companie; and he

was clothed in a cote hardy upon the guyse of Almayne, &amp; in this
wise he come further before the lordes and the ladies, and made hem
goodly reuerence.  And so the said Sir Piere called this yonge squier
with his voys before aƚƚ the statis, and said vnto hym and axed
hym, where was his fedyƚƚ or his Ribible, or suche an Instrument
as longithe vnto a mynstraƚƚ.  "Syr," saide the squier, "y canne

whiche were aƚƚ worthi men, but y sawe neuer none of hem that

the yonge squier ansuered the knight and saide, "Sir, by as moche as
it mislykithe you, it shaƚƚ be amended," and cleped a purseuaunt,
and gaue hym the cote hardy.  And he abled hym selff in an other
gowne, and come ayen into the halle, &amp; thanne the auncyen knight
saide opinly, "This yonge squier shaƚƚ haue worshipe, for he

by the techinge and ensaumples of the olde wise, and they do and
gouerne hem selff there after, they may not faile to come vnto gret

yonge woman owithe to receyue the doctrine and techinge of hem that
bene thaire eldres, and wiser thanne they; for aƚƚ that they saye

thanne suche as be moche more cunninge, and as haue seyn the cours of

it was hard̛ frosen, these Galoys &amp; Galoyses dyd̛ on

This lyf <MILESTONE N="sign. l., p. iii. b" UNIT="page"/>

bacbyters whiche ben neuer cessyng to talke of som cuylle rather than
of somme good̛ wherby they take away &amp; dyffamen the
good̛ Renomme of the good̛ wymmen, and̛ of many a
good̛ lady.  And̛ therfore alle wymmen whiche ben not wedded
may kepe and̛ hold̛ them self fro hit; And̛ that for
many Reasons.  The fyrste Reason is, by cause that a woman whiche is
enamoured̛ of a man maye not serue God̛ of no good̛
herte ne trewe, as she dyd̛ before.  For many one I haue
herd̛ saye, the wℏiche haue ben amerous in theyr yongthe,
that when they were in the chirche theyre thought and̛ melancolye
made them ofte to thynke vnto theyr delytes and̛ to theyr
peramours more than they dyd̛ to the seruyse of God̛.
And̛ also the arte of loue is of suche kynde, that whanne one is
in the Chirche to here masse and̛ the dyuyne seruyse, and̛
as the preest holdeth the body of oure Lord̛ bytwene his handes,
than cometh most to his mynde euylle and̛ fowle thoughtes.  This
is the arte or crafte of the goddesse that men calle Venus, the whiche
had̛ the name of a planete, as I herd̛ saye of a good̛
and̛ trewe man, whiche preched and̛ sayd̛ how ones the
deuylle entred̛ into the body of a dampned̛ woman, whiche
was Ioly and̛ gaye, and̛ moche amerous.  The deuylle that
was within her body made her to doo many fals myracles; wherfor the
paynyms helde her for a goddesse, and worshipped̛ her as a

god.  And̛ this Venus was she that gaf counceylle to the Troians
that they shold̛ sende Parys, the sone of kyng Priamus, into
Grece, and̛ that she shold̛ make hym rauysshe and̛ haue
with hym the fayrest lady of al Grece, wherof she sayd̛ trouthe.
For Parys dyd̛ rauysshe the fayr Helayne, the wyf of the kynge
Mene1aus, for the wℏiche faytte or dede were slayne afterward
more than xl kynges and̛ .xii. C M other persones and̛ mo.
Wherof this Venus was of al thys grete meschyef pryncipall cause.  She
was an euylle goddesse, fulle of euylle temptacion.  She is the
goddesse of loue, whiche kyndeleth and chauffeth the amerous hertes,

theyr deuocion whiche they haue toward̛ oure Lord̛.  And̛
knowe ye for certayne, my fayr doughters, that a woman whiche is
amerous shalle neuer sette her herte to God̛, ne she shall not

how that euery woman amerous is more tempted̛ wythin the Chyrche
than in eny other place.  And̛ the same is the fyrst reason how a
yonge woman must kepe herself fro suche folysshe loue, and̛ not
be in no wyse amerous.  The other rayson is by cause of many gentylle
men, whiche ben so fals and̛ deceyuable, that they requyre euery
gentylle woman that they may fynde; And̛ to them they swere that
they shalle kepe to them their feythe, and̛ be trewe to them,
and̛ shalle loue them without falshed̛ or deceyuaunce,
and̛ that rather they shold̛ deye than to thynke ony vylonye
or dysℏonoure, And̛ that they shalle be the better
preysed̛ for the loue of them, And̛ that, yf they haue ony
good̛ and̛ worship, it shalle come by them.  And̛ thus
they shalle shewe and̛ saye to them so many reasons and̛
abusions, that a grete meruaylle is to here hem speke.  And̛ yet
more they gyue oute of theyr brestes grete and̛ fayned̛

 And̛ after they cast a fals
loke.  And̛ thenne the good̛ and̛ debonayr wymmen that
sene them, supposen that they be esprysed̛ of trewe and̛
feythfull loue.  But al suche maner of folke whiche vsen to make suche
semblaunt, ben but deceyuours or begylers of the ladyes and̛
damoysels.  For there is no lady ne damoysell that wold̛ here
them, but that they shold̛ be deceyued̛ of them by theyr
fals reasons, whiche they sℏold̛ not here.  These ben
contrary to the feythfulle and̛ trewe louers.  For he that loueth
with god̛ and̛ trewe loue, as he cometh before his
peramours, he is ferynge and̛ dredefull lest he doo ony
thyng̛ that may displease her; For he is not so hardy to
discouere ne say one onely word̛ And̛ yf he loue her wel, I
wene that he shalle be thre or four yere er he dar saye his secrete

that they fynd̛ as aboue is sayd, And are not in drede ne in fere

And̛ therfore, my fayre doughters, take ye here good̛ ensample,

suche Iewels for nought, many a woman put her self in subiection; and̛ oftyme it befalleth therfor that they be deceyued.
And̛ thus is it good to aduyse and̛ beware hym self before the
