All material, except for the back matter, including the Name Index and Glossary, is included and is represented in the electronic edition as it was in the print edition (so far as is possible). The text was encoded by Kenneth Church, proofread by Kenneth Church (5%), and the markup reviewed by Catherine Paul.</P><P>All "corr" tags correspond to corrections that the editor, Leon Kellner, made from the original.  The "sic" attribute contains the word or phrase as it appeared in the manuscript.</P><P>Kellner has created three basic types of notes that are tagged in different ways.  First, where text has been added by the scribe and noted by Kellner by the phrase "Wanting in the French," or "Wanting," the text has been surrounded by "add" tags and Kellner's note retained as a pointer or note inside the "add" tags.  Second, where Kellner has supplied the original French for a phrase in the English text, the note contains both the French and the English parallel.  Finally, on occasion Kellner notes where the English text omits the French original.  These instances are marked as notes as they occur in the text.</P><P>Milestone markers are inserted as they occur in the English editions, although some are missing.  Milestone markers that appear in brackets at the beginning of the two parallel versions of the English text have been inserted into this electronic edition to help orient the reader and do not occur in Kellner's edition.</P><P>At the beginning of the text, two versions of the first six chapters and part of the seventh chapter run parallel to one another -- the first from Caxton's 1489 edition, and the second from the 1595 translation by Thomas Pope Goodwine.  Therefore, we have maintained the parallel structure by running each chapter of the 1595 edition after its counterpart from the Caxton edition (ca. 1489) . The chapter title for both versions is supplied from an abbreviated title from the Caxton chapters.  Each version retains its original chapter title.   Similarly, a parallel structure has been maintained at the end of the text for the final chapter, which consists of the English version of Caxton, continued by the 1595 edition of T.P. Goodwine, running parallel to a French version taken from the Paris MS. Bibl. Nat. 24,371 of the French original. </P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE ID="fre">French</LANGUAGE><LANGUAGE ID="lat">Latin</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE></PROFILEDESC></HEADER><TEXT><FRONT><TITLEPAGE><DOCTITLE><TITLEPART>Caxton's

RELATIONS between the Noun and the other parts of speech.</HEAD><P>From the logician's point of view, every 'part of speech' has a
province of its own, strictly limited and separated from the other
'parts'; but in practice, language constantly cuts the line drawn by
Aristotle, and some English students are wont to say that nearly
every short English noun and verb can be used as verb, noun, and
adjective, while nearly every adjective can be used as a noun: 'a
plant, plant-life or plant-culture, to plant; tea, tea-district, we'll tea
you at our tent; love, love trifles, to love; his english, English ways,
to english; the true, the beautiful; true that line,' &amp;c.;</P><P>In Old English there are several instances in which both noun
and adjective are denoted by the same form of a word, as earfoð
(difficulty and difficult), leoht (light sb., bright adj.), weorð (worth,
sb. and adj.), yrre (wrath, sb. and adj.); every adjective may be used
substantively, in the singular as well as in the plural, in the positive
as well as in the comparative and superlative degree; the infinitive
and the verbal noun (in -ung, -ing) may be said to belong to the
noun as well as to the verb.  Theoretically, the tendency of every
literary language of the present day is to observe the laws of logic in
grammar and style, and to restrict as far as possible the use of every
part of speech to its own dominion, though practically, as stated
above, speakers and writers claim and exercise full freedom in this
respect.  Caxton and his contemporaries did not care to be fettered
by niceties of logic, and thus we have to state the following relations,
in his books, between the noun and the other parts of speech.</P><DIV5 NODE="Blanchardyn:5.1.1.1.1" TYPE="sub-theme" ID="DIV5.9"><HEAD>1. Nouns used as adjectives.</HEAD><P>We have kept in Modern English a few such expressions as
'queen-mother, queen-dowager, lord-lieutenant,'<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.2">At the Philological Society's Meeting on Nov. 1., when parts of this Introduction were read as a Paper, the Members divided these 3 sample-words into
two classes, I. two nouns, 'queen-mother'; II. noun and adjective, 'queen-dowager,'
'lord-lieutenant.'</NOTE1> where 'queen,' 'lord'


<EPB/><PB N="vi" ID="pb.7"/>
are to be looked on more as appositions than as the first part of
compounds; and there are others, like 'fellow-creature, deputy-marshal,
champion-sculler,' where 'fellow,' 'deputy,' 'champion' are
used quite adjectively.  But while in Modern English this use is
restricted in common speech to a few cases,—I exclude the conscious
archaisms in poetry and historic romances,—Caxton is very free in
forming such appositive compositions:—</P><P>the paynem kynge Alymodes, <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1> 38/2, 90/25, 133/11;

for a time, though it is afterwards revived in literary, if not in
common, speech.  Berners, in his <HI1 REND="i">Huon of Burdeux</HI1>, has still 'a
felon traitour,' I. 5/4; 'thou ſalse traitour knyght,' I. 41/26.  But
the edition of 1601 alters the latter passage into 'trayterous knyght.'
'Traitor knight' and like expressions will, however, be found in
plenty of later poems and romances, though more or less consciously
as archaisms.</P></DIV5><DIV5 NODE="Blanchardyn:5.1.1.1.2" TYPE="sub-theme" ID="DIV5.10"><HEAD>2. Adjectives used substantively.</HEAD><P>Compared with its power in Old English, and even in the first
two centuries of the Middle-English period, the adjective of the
present day has lost a good deal of its vigour and independence.
By inflexion, any adjective could formerly express alone what it can
now say only by adding a noun: e. g. se góda (the good man), þœt

<EPB/><PB N="vii" ID="pb.8"/>
gód (the good, in opposition to evil), þá gódan (the good ones, the
righteous).  We can still use: 'the good and evil of this life, of
adversity,' &amp;c.; 'the good (pl.) shall be happy, the evil (pl.) miserable,
hereafter.'  But in consequence of the inflexion having decayed, the
independence of the adjective was to some extent given up, in order
to avoid ambiguity.  In Modern English prose we only retain—and
in the plural only, as to persons—those which exclude all ambiguity,
e. g. 'the poor and the rich,' always plural now, Psalms and Bible
used singular, or whose ambiguity the context removes.  Caxton's
use of the adjectives is, in this respect, nearly modern.</P><P>The adjectives used substantively may be divided into the
following groups:—</P><LIST><ITEM>(a) Adjectives qualifying concrete nouns, mostly persons.<LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL><HI1 REND="i">Specyall</HI1></LABEL> = friend, <HI1 REND="i">Blanch</HI1>. 84/34; elsewhere, frende specyall, 72/10,

as: frenshe, <HI1 REND="i">Blanch</HI1>. 1/24; englysshe, 1/24, 2/9; b. colours, as: in red,
64/10, 164/5; and c. adjectives in the genitive case used adverbially,
as: of freshe, <HI1 REND="i">Blanch</HI1>. 164/12, 165/21; of newe, <HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. 100/26, 147/18,
195/7.  The latter correspond to the Middle English 'newes,' <HI1 REND="i">Story
of Gen. and Exodus</HI1> (ed. R. Morris), l. 240, and note; of lyght =
lightly, 129/33.</P><P>There is one instance of an abstract adjective in the comparative
degree: 'men must suffre, for better to haue,' <HI1 REND="i">Blanch</HI1>. 68/25.
</P><EPB/><PB N="viii" ID="pb.9"/><P>But it occurs pretty often in the superlative:—The thykkest of

The Nominative Case.</HEAD><P>The Nominative in Middle English ranges over a wider area than
in Old English.  First, its dominion is enlarged in consequence of
the other cases losing their characteristic inflexions, and being mistaken
for the nominative; secondly, it is used in syntactic connections
and expressions which were unknown to the older periods of
the English language.</P><P>In the struggle between the nominative and the accusative (or
dative?) case of the personal pronoun (ye and you), as late as the end
of the 15th century, the nominative is far from being overcome.</P><P>1. The first function of the nominative is to express the subject
of a sentence.  So far as the logical subject is concerned, there has
been no change from Old English down to Modern English times.</P><P>2. But in the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, the grammatical
subject became much more frequent and important than ever
it was before.</P><P>(a) While Old English is very rich in impersonal verbs, there is a
tendency in the later periods of Middle English towards the personal
expression, that is to say (as Koch puts it), what once appeared as a<EPB/><PB N="xii" ID="pb.13"/>
dim sensation is made to appear as the conscious action of the free
mind.  Instead of 'hit hreóưeð, hit sceameð, hit licað, hit langað,'
there appear 'I repent, I am ashamed, I like, I long.'  This natural
development was favoured by two external causes.  In such instances
as 'Wo was this kyng,' <HI1 REND="i">Chaucer</HI1>, II. 193, what is an indirect object
was mistaken for the nominative case; and secondly, the French
model had great influence.  See Chapter VI. on the Impersonal Verbs,
p. xlvii, below.</P><P>(b) The second encroachment of the nominative on the dative case
took place in the passive constructions of transitive verbs governing
a direct and an indirect object, or of intransitive verbs followed by
prepositions.  This innovation was brought about first by the dative
and accusative cases being confounded.  Objects governed by verbs
like 'command, answer,' etc., were consequently looked upon as
accusative cases, and were treated as such, so that they became
capable of the passive construction.</P><P>In Caxton's time, however, that process was not yet completed;
hence such expressions as the following, which we still keep: 'as
was tolde him by the knyght,' <HI1 REND="i">Blanch</HI1>. 43/1; 'all that was told him,'
196/20.  See the chapter on the Passive, p. lxi, below.</P><P>3. The Nominative absolute wholly supplanted the Old English
dative, and became much more popular than the Old English construction
(apparently from Latin) had ever been.  This use, which is
quite common in the 14th century (for Chaucer, cf. <HI1 REND="i">Einenkel</HI1>, p. 74,
ff.), occurs rather frequently in the time of Caxton, and offers nothing
of special interest:—</P><P>'This ansuere y-herde, Alymodes ... made his oost to approche,'
<HI1 REND="i">Blanch</HI1>. 57/28; 'and that doon, ... he shall mowe,' etc., 73/24;—preceded
by after, 94/6; <HI1 REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI1>, 44/21, 47/31, 58/31,
61/12, 62/17, and <HI1 REND="i">passim</HI1>; <HI1 REND="i">Huon</HI1>, 3/29, 39/5.</P><P>4. Another function of the nominative case was that in connection
with the infinitive:—</P><P><HI1 REND="i">e. g.</HI1> 'I say this, be ye redy with good herte To al my lust, and
that I frely may As me best liste do you laughe or smerte, And neuer

189/22, 432/14, 438/10.</P><P>(b) There is another instance in which the nominative case has
been encroached upon by the dative.  That well-known tendency of
using absolute personal pronouns in the dative case, which has divided
the French pronouns into two different classes (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">conjoints</FOREIGN> and <FOREIGN LANG="fre">absolus</FOREIGN>),
and which appears in such modern English phrases as 'it is me,
older than me,' is not wholly unknown to Caxton.  He always
has 'it is I'<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.10">Chaucer 'it am I.'</NOTE1> (never me!), but in the following passages, p. xiv, there
is apparently a faint germ of that use.</P><P>In <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1> the dative occurs twice where we expect the
nominative case; but there seems to be a sort of mixed construction:

360/33, 450/13, and frequently.  Instead of of, a sometimes
appears:—</P><P>'yf he had been yet man alyue, I wolde haue gyuen you tyl his

to reward the after thy merite.'—<HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>, 109/9.</P><P>4. The genitive of the personal pronoun instead of the possessive
pronoun occurs very frequently:—</P><P>(I) 'knewe wel that the story of hit was honeste.'—<HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>,
1/11.  'the sowle of the (thee),' 17/21; 'for pryde of her,' 39/14;
'the herte of hym,' 39/33, 64/17, 86/20, 87/31, 92/7, 106/17, 114/32,
etc.</P><P>This use is especially worth noting, when it occurs in sentences
like the following:—</P><P>'ye haue exposed the body of you and of your men,' 171/20.  In
Modern English we should say: 'your body and those of your men.'
Malory once says: 'I pray you hertely to be my good frende and to
my sones,' <HI1 REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI1>, 406/28.</P><P>5. The partitive genitive was not a great favourite with the
English of the 14th and 15th centuries.  After comparing the use
of this case in that time with what it was in Old English, we
cannot but conclude that the idea of partition attached to such
phrases as MÁÐMA FELA (many treasures), <HI1 REND="i">Beówulf</HI1> 36, in Old
English was about to be supplanted by that of the simple apposition.
Apart from the fact that the numerals, as well as many
indefinite adverbs and pronouns, no longer governed the genitive,
compare the following expressions:—</P><LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL><HI1 REND="i">Robert of Gloucester</HI1> (quoted by Koch, II2, p. 169):</LABEL> 'þe þrydde<EPB/><PB N="xvii" ID="pb.18"/>

common in the 14th century, as Chaucer offers several instances of it.
The passage runs as follows: 'but of all Fraunce I am one of the best

Chaucer:—</P><P>'Oon of the grettest auctour that men rede' (5 MSS., one has
'auctours'), III. 234; 'On of the best farynge man on lyue,' III. 8;

best knyght.'  II. 'One of the best knyghtes.'  The former, which

points respecting Caxton's use of the partitive genitive.</P><P>(a) There are numerous instances of the independent, or, as it is
sometimes called, the elliptic genitive partitive, which is so often
met with in Chaucer; cf. 'Of smale houndes hadde sche, that she
fedde,' II. 5.  Before Chaucer the instances are rare.  Perhaps the
following passages may be looked upon as approaching that use:—</P><P>'hwa se euer wule habbe lot wið þe of þi blisse: he mot dea'e
wið þe of þine pine on eorþe.'—<HI1 REND="i">O. E. Hom</HI1>. I. 187.  'man eggeð his

.—<HI1 REND="i">Ayenbite</HI1>,
37.</P><P>Caxton has several instances of this use:—</P><P>'(She) tolde hym that she was right wel content of his seruyce,
and wolde reteyne hym in wages, and gyue hym of her goodes, for he
was worthy therof.'—<HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>, 75/5.  'wherof the kynge was
right wele content, and reseyued hym of his hous.'—<HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. 99/21; =
as one of his house, or court.  (Cf. <HI1 REND="i">Huon</HI1>, I. 13/20: 'the two sonnes<EPB/><PB N="xix" ID="pb.20"/>

'Englysh marchauntes do fetch of the erth of Irlonde to caste in

conclude that the English of that time did not relish this use in
prose.  The original edition has: 'for incontinent they wyll sende
of theyr shyppes, and take thys shyp,' 212/29; the edition of 1601
alters of into 'some of.'</P><P>(b) Here and there indefinite pronouns like 'much, many
(other)' are followed by of + noun: 'for he hath doon to us this
day so moche of euyl.'—<HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>, 169/22.  'wherof soo many of
children (were) faderles, and soo many churches wasted.'—<HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1>,
27/19.  'a grete many of prysoners.'—<HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. 87/4.  But, as a rule,
the modern use prevails.</P><P>(c) There is another sort of Genitive, which we may, perhaps, not
improperly term pseudo-partitive, viz. that which appears in sentences
like 'a castle of hers, a knight of Arthur's.'  It is true, that in many
cases we might translate these phrases by 'one of her castles, one of
Arthur's knights'; but there are many examples in Middle English
which do not admit of such an explanation, and the Modern English
use ('that beautiful face of hers!') proves that no idea of partition
is included in such expressions.  After a close examination of the
oldest instances as met with in the 14th century (second half?), we
see that they are brought into existence by another necessity.</P><P>In Old English the possessive pronoun, or, as the French say,
'pronominal adjective,' expresses only the conception of belonging<EPB/><PB N="xx" ID="pb.21"/>
and possession; it is a real adjective, and does not convey, as at
present, the idea of determination.  If, therefore, Old English
authors want to make such nouns determinative, they add the
definite article:</P><P>hæleð mín se leofa, <HI1 REND="i">Elene</HI1>, 511; þú eart dóhtor mín séo dýreste,
<HI1 REND="i">Juliana</HI1>, 166; þæt tacnede Leoniða on his þæm nihstan gefeohte and
Persa, <HI1 REND="i">Orosius</HI1>, 84/31; Mammea his sio gode modor, <HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. 270/26;

þurh his þæs mran forryneles and fulluhteres ðingunge, <HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. I.
364/5.  The article preceding the possessive pronoun: se heora
cyning, <HI1 REND="i">Orosius</HI1>, 56/31; seo heora iugoð, <HI1 REND="i">Blickling Homilies</HI1>, 163/3;
seo hire gebyrd, 163/9, etc.</P><P>In Middle English the possessive pronoun apparently has a
determinative meaning (as in Modern English, Modern German, and
Modern French); therefore its connection with the definite article is
made superfluous, while the indefinite article is quite impossible.
Hence arises a certain embarrassment with regard to one case which
the language cannot do without.  Suppose we want to say 'she is in
a castle belonging to her,' where it is of no importance whatever,
either to the speaker or hearer, to know whether 'she' has got more
than one castle—how could the English of the Middle period put it?
The French of the same age said still 'un sien castel'; but that was
no longer possible in English.  There's only one instance of indefinite
article + possessive pronoun that has come to my knowledge, and that
is of the early period of Middle English: <HI1 REND="i">Sawles Warde</HI1> (<HI1 REND="i">O. E. H.</HI1>,
I. p. 265): 'for euch an is al mihti to don al þat he wule, ȝe, makie
to cwakien heouene ba ant eorþe wið his an finger' (for one is
mighty enough to do all that he desires, yea, to make heaven and
earth quake with one of his fingers.  Translation by R. Morris).<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.11"> Other instances, however, may have escaped my notice, and it is worth while to search Middle English literature for evidence on this hitherto
puzzling point.</NOTE1></P><P>We should expect the genitive of the personal pronoun (of me,
etc., as in Modern German),—and there may have been a time when
this use prevailed,—but, so far as I know, the language decided in

<EPB/><PB N="xxi" ID="pb.22"/>
favour of the more complicated and rather absurd construction 'of
mine, of thine,' etc.</P><P>This was, in all probability, brought about by the analogy of
the very numerous cases in which the indeterminative noun connected
with mine, etc., had a really partitive sense (cf. the examples
below), and, moreover, by the remembrance of the old construction
with the possessive pronoun.</P><P>There is a good deal of guesswork in this explanation, of course;
but one thing is sure—it was the impossibility of connecting the
indefinite article with the possessive pronoun which suggested the
new construction.  This is proved by indisputable chronological facts.</P><P>I. First, we find the indefinite article (or the equally indefinite
words any, every, no) in connection with of mine, of thine, etc.  This
construction is met with in the 14th century.</P><P>II. Next, analogy introduces the indefinite article in connection
with the double genitive of a noun, 'a knyght of king Arthur's.'</P><P>III. Last, we come across definite pronouns (this, that) in connection
with of mine; and exceptionally the definite article occurs
there also in connection with the double genitive of a noun (the
knight of kyng Arthur's).</P><LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL>CHAUCER:</LABEL>A friend of his, IV. 130, IV. 257, IV. 356; an hors

Arthur and his knights has often (in English Grammars, &amp;c.;) suggested
the supposition that there is a sort of ellipsis in this construction:
a knyghte of kynge Arthurs = a knyghte of kynge
Arthurs court.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.12">Cf. two knyghtes of kynge Arthurs Courte, 297/1, 6, 16, 298/33, etc.</NOTE1> But first of all, such instances as 'a trusty frende
of syr Tristrams,' 'I am forester of the Emperors,' do not admit of
such an explanation—unless we say 'among Sir T.'s friends,' 'among
the Emperor's foresters';—and secondly, there are no other examples
of this elliptic construction in Caxton or Malory.</P><P>Of Group III., there are two instances in <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1> with that,

differs in Caxton from the modern use.</P><P>Besides such verbs as 'demand, require, serve, tell,' quoted above,
behold is followed by of, e. g. Aymon, 391/26; and especially noteworthy
is the construction of swear.  In Middle English this verb is
followed by on.  Cf. <HI1 REND="i">Chaucer</HI1>, IV. 363: and this on every God
celestial I swere it yow, V. 222.  Caxton uses 'swear' as a transitive
verb, and makes the accusative case follow it: he sware his Godes,
<HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>, 92/25, 107/22; swore God, <HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1>, 38/4, 73/14, 87/10,
185/4, 201/33, 459/11, 471/7, 515/7, 526/17.  In <HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1> are only
three examples of 'swear' followed by a preposition: (he) sware by
God, <HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1>, 61/29; he sware by saint Denys, <HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. 411/11; I swere
upon all sayntes, <HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. 85/4.</P><P>From one passage of the <HI1 REND="i">Ayenbite</HI1>, and another in <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>,
we may safely infer that this use is due to French influence.

<HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1>, 574/30; 'Then syr Launcelot cryed: the knyght wyth the
blak shelde, make the redy to Iuste wyth me!' <HI1 REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI1>,
392/16.</P><P>(b) Possessive Pronouns used substantively are sometimes preceded
by the definite Article:—</P><P>'Thenne toke the prouost his spere, and so dyde Blanchardyn the

Tristram, the one of us shalle dye or we departe.</P><P>In all these three groups Caxton copied only too faithfully his
French originals.  I do not know of any other Middle English
instance of 'the his'; but as for 'the two,' there is the authority of
Chaucer and the unknown translator of the <HI1 REND="i">Romaunt of the Rose</HI1>, if
not to sanction it as a good Middle English expression, at least to
excuse it:</P><P>And sins he ran . . . And borwed him large boteles thre; and in

French influence:—</P><P>The captayne gaff the goode nyght to the damoyselle, <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>,
51/27 (Original: <FOREIGN LANG="fre">la bonne nuit</FOREIGN>); and gaff hym the goode nyght,

coude not kepe hymself, but that the grete teerys dropped fast out of
his eyen, ibid. 145/33.</P><P>(d) Before two adjectives qualifying one noun, the Article is
often repeated:—</P><P>He sawe there under in a playn a moche ample and a grete
medowe, <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>, 32/2; the prouoste of the towne dyde ordeyne

'mine, thine, ours, yours' is the rule; 'our, your' occur, but quite
exceptionally:—</P><P>I haue herde that ye haue called me and my broder the sones of

Genitive Case, p. xv.</P><P>(b) The possessive pronoun my is used as a term of courtesy.  It
occurs very frequently in connection with lady, so as to form almost
one word.  This is made evident by the repetition of my in the
following instances:—</P><P>Unto the right noble puyssaunt and excellent pryncesse, my

<HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1>, 88/26; 'it was I that slewe this knyght in my deffendaunt,'
<HI1 REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI1>, 83/25.  This is false analogy to the other
gerundial constructions, like 'in my talking,' etc., formed out of the
intransitive or transitive verbs.  There is a parallel passage in
Chaucer:—'Another homicidy is doon for necessite, as whan a man
sleth another in his defendaunt,' III. 312.  One MS., however, has
him defendaunt.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.14">Perhaps the following passage cannot be explained in the same way:—'Syre, ye be a right fayre Iouncell . . . and to my seming right wel worthy to

relative clause:—</P><P>'He that wyll be enhaunced in price, he oughte not to loke soo
nyghe.'—<HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1>, 354/23.</P><P>In Old and Middle English this type is nearly always a sort of
anacoluthon to our modern eyes and ears, and perhaps it was such
indeed.  The essential point in which this construction differs from
the modern use is, that the correlative always appears in the nominative
case, without regard to its place in the sentence; it is only the
redundant pronoun, personal or possessive, in the second part, which
marks the subjective or objective case of the correlative, e. g., in
Modern English we might say:—'To her who was not skilled in
receiving such guests, his acquaintance was hard to make,' but
Caxton has:—'and she that was not lerned to receyue suche geestes,
sore harde was his acquaintance to her.'—<HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>, 67/29, 30.</P><EPB/><PB N="xliii" ID="pb.44"/><P>Accordingly I distinguish two groups of type II.</P><P>(a) The correlative is the subject of the sentence.  Then the
redundant personal pronoun appears in the nominative case.</P><P>This pronoun is, as said above (see 'Personal Pronoun'), very
frequent in Old English and Middle English.  Perhaps we might
say that this is the rule; at least the <HI1 REND="i">Old English Homilies</HI1> seem to
suggest such a supposition.  There are in the Second Series twenty-three
instances of the redundant pronoun, namely, p. 15, l. 4 from
top; p. 15, l. 4 from foot; p. 19, l. 9 from top; p. 43, l. 3 from
top; p. 45, l. 16 from foot, and on pages 69 (twice), 73, 75, 99,
115 (twice), 133 (twice), 143, 153 (three times), 155, 159, 201,
203, 207; while only six passages omit it, namely, on pages 11, 17,
19, 73, 111, 151.</P><P>In Caxton this is no longer the case.  There is not one instance
of the group (a) in <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>; and in <HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1> they are not very
numerous.  See 'Personal Pronoun.'</P><P>(b) The correlative is the object (direct or indirect) of the sentence;
then, as a rule, it is in the nominative case, and the redundant
personal pronoun is either in the genitive (his, her, their) or dative
(accusative) case:—</P><P>Alle synfulle men þe heued-synnes don habbeð, and nel'eð þerof

Malory, <HI1 REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI1>, 174/13.</P><P>There is one instance in Malory in which—if Caxton or his
compositor did not introduce a first gaf not in the author's copy—both
the old and modern uses are mixed in one: 'Thenne the kyng
stablysshed all his knyghtes and [gaf] them that were of londes not
ryche, he gaf them londes . . .' <HI1 REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI1>, 118/13.  Malory
(if the first gaf was his) began with the modern construction: 'and
gaf them that were of londes not ryche (londes),' but in the second
half of the sentence he found it would be quite confusing and
impossible to add 'londes' only to his long adjective 'that were of
londes not ryche,' and he therefore repeated the words which
governed 'londes,' the old use suggesting itself to his memory as a
justification for his cumbrousness.  This use occurs very often in
Berners:—</P><P>The londe that they hold, gyue it to Charlot your sone, <HI1 REND="i">Huon</HI1>,
5/13; with my sworde I so defendyd me, that he that thought to

personal pronoun in the correlative is the same as in type II.</P><P>In the <HI1 REND="i">Ayenbite</HI1> the pronoun is the rule, just as in the French

with regard to their syntactical use, from Old English down to

mind have undergone an important change.  As stated above (see

personal, and we have now but a few instances of such verbs as 'it<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.20">This it is a false subject, to throw the true subject after the verb.</NOTE1>

The Infinitive. Active and Passive.</HEAD><P>While, as mentioned above, the Infinitive in Old English—as well
as in the other Teutonic languages—was indifferent with regard to
voice, the later periods of Middle English develope the passive on the
same principle as Latin, and are probably modelled on that.  Whenever
there is an action without a subject to do it, we find the passive
construction in Latin—<FOREIGN LANG="lat">infinitivus passivi</FOREIGN> and <FOREIGN LANG="lat">participium passivi</FOREIGN> (or
rather <FOREIGN LANG="lat">gerundium</FOREIGN>), e. g. <FOREIGN LANG="lat">militem occidi iussit; credendum est</FOREIGN>.  So
far as I am aware both these constructions are translated in Old
English, as well as in Middle English of the first centuries, by the
simple infinitive.  Instances abound:—</P><P>Þa hi þæt ne geþafodan, þa het he hi beheafdian,—Sweet, <HI1 REND="i">Oldest

II. 14.</P><P>As appears by the preceding examples, both participles serve to
represent clauses in the present and past tenses.  But how about the
future?  Why should there be no absolute construction for a clause
with a future tense?  The want of a proper participle did not prevent
the language from completing the use of absolute constructions.  It
resorted to the Infinitive.  Wycliffe tried to introduce a future participle.

<HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. 22, 23 (facturus).  But this innovation was not accepted.
There is, however, a similar formation in Caxton: 'Guy, hir loue
and tocoming husband,' <HI1 REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI1>, 134/27, i. e. that was to
be; 'Our tocomyng souerayne lorde,' <HI1 REND="i">Blades</HI1>, 139/140; it occurs also
in <HI1 REND="i">Piers Plowman</HI1>.  Cf. Skeat, Notes, p. 371, and Trevisa, <HI1 REND="i">Polychr</HI1>.
I. 267.  This probably gave birth to that peculiar use which, in the
course of its development, became more and more free, so that in the
15th century the Infinitive Absolute often serves to alternate with
any principal sentence and clause:—</P><LIST><ITEM><P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L ID="l.77">'I dar the better ask of you a space</L><L ID="l.78">Of audience, to schewen oure request</L><L ID="l.79">And ye, my lord, to doon right as yow lest.'</L></Q1><BIBL>—<HI1 REND="i">Chaucer</HI1>, II. 281.</BIBL></P></ITEM><EPB/><PB N="lxviii" ID="pb.69"/><ITEM><P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L ID="l.80">'Ne (he) in his desire none other fantasye bredde,</L><L ID="l.81">But argumentes to this conclusioun,</L><L ID="l.82">That sche of him wolde han compassioun</L><L ID="l.83">And he to ben hire man whil he may dure.'</L></Q1><BIBL>—<HI1 REND="i">Chaucer</HI1>, IV. 127.</BIBL></P></ITEM><ITEM><P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L ID="l.84">'(I mene that ye wolde) agreen that I may ben he</L><L ID="l.85">In trowth alway to don yow my servyse,</L><L ID="l.86">As to my lady right, and chief resorte</L><L ID="l.87">With al my wit and al my diligence,</L><L ID="l.88">And I to han right as yow list conforte ....</L><L ID="l.89">And that ye deigne me so muchel honoure</L><L ID="l.90">Me to comaunden aught in any houre,</L><L ID="l.91">And I to ben youre veray humble trewe.'</L></Q1><BIBL>—<HI1 REND="i">Chaucer</HI1>, IV. 230.</BIBL></P></ITEM><ITEM><P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L ID="l.92">'Men schold him brenne in a fuyr so reed</L><L ID="l.93">If he were founde, or if men myght him spye,</L><L ID="l.94">And we also to bere him companye.'</L></Q1><BIBL>—<HI1 REND="i">Chaucer</HI1>, III. 38.</BIBL></P></ITEM></LIST><P>Item, I geue and quethe to Willm Husher III s.

present participle.</P><P>1. Governed by the preposition in.</P><P>We now use in in connection with the verbal noun, where, in
Old English, the simple participle was preferred, e. g. 'ealo drincende
oðer sædon' = others said in drinking ale, Beowulf, <HI1 REND="i">1946</HI1>.  I



<EPB/><PB N="lxxvi" ID="pb.77"/>
suppose that in, imitated from the French, was grafted upon the old
participle, so that it kept its verbal function.  Therefore it was not
followed by of, even in the earliest periods of its use:—</P><P>And thei seye, that we synne dedly, in schavynge oure Berdes,—
<HI1 REND="i">Maundeville</HI1>, p. 19; he was a dedly Creature, suche as God hadde

<HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. p. 47; and in bryngynge hire Servyse, thei syngen a Song, <HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>.
p. 310.</P><P>Caxton very often drops in, as in <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>, 14/20, 16/8,
18/8, 33/12, etc.  But even when it precedes the verbal noun, it is
not followed by of:—</P><P>I am come to serue her in kepyng my worship,—<HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>,
76/11; and in tornynge hemself ayen, [they] layde hande on their

<HI1 REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI1>, 26/34, 52/11, 66/34, 85/23, 163/19, etc.</P><P>2. There are a few passages in Caxton, which, in my opinion,
throw a most interesting light on the use of the verbal noun, both
in Middle English and in modern times.  'Most humblie beseekynge
my . . . lord to pardon me so presumyng,' <HI1 REND="i">Blades</HI1>, 140; 'take no
displaysir on me so presuming,' <HI1 REND="i">ibid</HI1>. 148.  Cf. 165.  I see in this
construction a mode of expression which was the only one used in
old times, and which still remains in vulgar English: 'don't mind me
sitting down.'</P><P>In Old English, as well as in Latin, Greek, and the old Teutonic
languages, it is not the action or state as an abstract, but the
person or thing acting, which is the subject of perception, feeling,
or thought.  '<FOREIGN LANG="lat">hac literae recitatae magnum luctum fecerunt</FOREIGN>' = the
reading of this letter, <HI1 REND="i">Livius</HI1>, 27, 29; '<FOREIGN LANG="lat">poena violatae religionis iustam
recusationem non habet</FOREIGN>' = for the violation of religion,—Cicero, <HI1 REND="i">De
Leg</HI1>., 2, 15.</P><P>To this principle are due many of the so-called absolute constructions
in the Old Teutonic dialects.  See <HI1 REND="i">Grimm</HI1>, IV. 873, ff.</P><P>It appears also in the noun-clauses in Old and Middle English.
Instead of the modern abstract sentence, e. g. 'you see that he's going
away,' the old construction is, 'you see him that he goes away.'  So
<HI1 REND="i">Old English Hom</HI1>., I. 17; 'ȝif þu hine iseȝe þet he wulle assottie to<EPB/><PB N="lxxvii" ID="pb.78"/>
þes deofles.'  See below, 'Noun Clauses.'  The same principle appears
also in the following instances illustrating the older use:—</P><P>Be þe lifigendum (during thy life time), <HI1 REND="i">Beówulf</HI1>, 2666; be þæm
lifigendum, <HI1 REND="i">Beda</HI1>, 2, 5; To-janes þo sunne risindde = at the time of
sunrise, <HI1 REND="i">Old English Miscellany</HI1>, 26.</P><LIST><ITEM><P><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L ID="l.115">'Alle waters als þai sall rynne</L><L ID="l.116">And þat sal last fra þe son rysyng</L><L ID="l.117">Til þe tyme of þe son doungangyng.'</L></Q1><BIBL><HI1 REND="i">Pricke of Conscience</HI1>, 4777 f.</BIBL></P></ITEM><ITEM><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L ID="l.118">'After the sunne goyng down.'</L></Q1><BIBL>—<HI1 REND="i">Genesis</HI1>, 28, 11.</BIBL></ITEM></LIST><P>In later times this use began to decay, as indeed in every respect
abstraction supplanted intuition, and the verbal noun took the place
of the old present participle.  Thus Purvey alters the instance quoted
above to 'aftir the goyng down of the sunne.'  Cf. <HI1 REND="i">Exod</HI1>. xxii. 26,
<HI1 REND="i">Deuteronomy</HI1> xi. 30.  Perhaps we may see the state of transition in
the following passages of the <HI1 REND="i">Ayenbite</HI1>.  The old participle is kept in
its outward form, but the new use, i. e. the verbal noun, throws its
shade on the construction.  Thus we have: 'ȝef he zuereþ fals be his
wytinde,' p. 6.  'Be him wytinde' would answer to the Old English
'lifigendum'; 'be his wytinge' would be quite modern (as it really
occurs, see below); the connection of both gives 'be his wytinde.'
Cf. pp. 8, 28, 37, 40, 47, 94, etc.  The French has: '<FOREIGN LANG="fre">à son (leur)
escient</FOREIGN>.'</P><P>Both the mixed and the modern construction occur on p. 73,
<HI1 REND="i">Ayenb</HI1>.: 'guo into helle ine þine libbinde: þet þou ne guo ine þine
steruinge' (original: '<FOREIGN LANG="fre">en ton vivant, en ton morant</FOREIGN>').</P><P>The extremely free use of the verbal noun as an adjective to substantives,
which is characteristic of Elizabethan English ('undeserving
praise,' 'unrecalling crime' in Shakspere) is not met with in Caxton.
Perhaps these are worth noting: 'fallyng sekeness,' <HI1 REND="i">Charles the
Grete</HI1>, 37/28; 'weepyng teerys,' <HI1 REND="i">Morte Darthur</HI1>, 338/9.  Cf. <HI1 REND="i">Huon</HI1>,

sentences as co-ordinate ones, which, logically, stand in the relation
of subordination.  But Caxton's prose also exhibits several striking
instances of this use.  Two principal sentences are asyndetically
joined together, where we should expect a principal sentence and a
subordinate clause:—</P><P>Whan he see Blanchardyn, that all prest was to furnyshe hys

by that, turns up very frequently in the shape of an Accusative in
connection with an Infinitive.  'It is better a man wysely to be
stille, than folysshly to speke,' <HI1 REND="i">Charles the Grete</HI1>, 93/5.  See § 30.</P><P>(B.) Much more interesting is the difference in the construction
of the Object Clause.  Compare the following two sentences: 'And
God saw the light that it was good' (<HI1 REND="i">Genesis</HI1>, i. 4); 'You see that I
am composed' (Dickens, <HI1 REND="i">Dombey and Son</HI1>, iii. 9).</P><P>Logically speaking, the two constructions are equivalent; but
psychologically, how different is the idea which they represent!  In
the first case the sentence expresses an abstract result; in the second,
the verb see has a concrete object, in which a certain attribute is
perceived.</P><P>The former way of expression is the older as well as the more
intuitive, and it crops up very often in Early English, though the
more modern one seems to have crept in at a very early period:—</P><LIST><ITEM><P><LABEL>Old English:</LABEL>  Ic þœt gehre, þœt þis is hold wëorod, <HI1 REND="i">Beowulf</HI1>, 290;

drawing to decay in Malory and Caxton; for in many instances that
is no longer understood as a conjunction, but as a relative pronoun;
consequently the personal pronoun is dropped, and the noun clause
becomes an adjective one:—</P><P>Whan the kynge herde the prouoste, that soo grete offre made for

adjectival one, Caxton uses the old construction.  Take for instance
this sentence, 'He saw a shield that he knew to be his brother's.'

we also often do now): 'He saw a shield that he knew was his

than Shakspere; and there is a still greater kinship between his
prose and that of the fourteenth century, than that of the Elizabethan
age.  In reading Caxton's books, the general impression resembles
very much that received by reading <HI1 REND="i">The Tale of Melibeus</HI1>, or even
<HI1 REND="i">Maundeville</HI1>; and the results of a minute analysis agrees with that
impression.  It is true, many peculiarities of Caxton's language turn
up also in Shakspere and Spenser; but we must keep in mind, that
there is always a sort of tradition in poetry, which links together the
remotest periods, while in simple prose, as in daily life, the distance
of times is of great influence.  There is a wide gap between the
language in Spenser's <HI1 REND="i">Faërie Queene</HI1>, not to speak of the <HI1 REND="i">Shepherd's
Calendar</HI1>, and his <HI1 REND="i">View of the State of Ireland</HI1>.</P><P>Thus, the plural of abstracts is very frequent in the poem, but
very rare in the prose treatise; the article is extremely often omitted
in the former, while it is used in the latter, etc.</P><P>There are several points, which draw a very marked line between
Caxton's syntax and that of the sixteenth century:—</P><LIST><ITEM><P>1. Ye, not you, is still, with a few exceptions, the nominative of
the 2nd pers. plural personal pronoun.  This is quite common in
Berners.  See p. xiii.</P></ITEM><EPB/><PB N="cx" ID="pb.111"/><ITEM><P>2. Adjectives referring to preceding nouns are not yet followed
by one.  See p. xxviii.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>3. The personal pronoun, when a subject, is still very often
omitted.  See p. xxxiii.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>4. Self is still considered an adjective, as seen by the 3rd
person plural: themselfe, never themselves.  The latter becomes the
rule about the middle of the sixteenth century.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>5. Who (in the nominative) as a relative pronoun is still unknown.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>6. The indefinite pronoun one is not yet used; in its stead we
find men.  See p. xlvi, §15.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>7. Constructions like 'we are banished the court' are not yet in

between transitive and intransitive verbs, with regard to the passive
voice.  See p. lv.</P></ITEM><ITEM><P>8. Agreement between tenses (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">consecutia temporum</FOREIGN>) is not yet

CAXTON AS A TRANSLATOR.  HIS STYLE.</HEAD><P>'IN his translation of this work, Caxton shows himself piously
literal.  Words and phrases, both foreign and unusual, he transferred
bodily to his text; nothing ever deterred him, simply because it was
French; he wandered along every winding of the sentences he was
rendering, and brought them over with all their sinuosities into
English.  In consequence, his translation is perhaps one of the most
literal that has ever been produced in the English language; and
though to some extent stilted and even awkward, yet it is impossible
not to admire his faithfulness to his original; and the very quaintness
of those peculiarities of language sometimes adds a charm to his
composition.'—Octavia Richardson, in the Introduction to her edition
of <HI1 REND="i">The Four Sonnes of Aymon</HI1>, E. E. T. Soc., p. vii.</P><EPB/><PB N="cxi" ID="pb.112"/><P>I don't think Caxton was such a pious slave.  His translation of
<HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>, no doubt, is as 'quaint' and even as 'awkward' as
that of <HI1 REND="i">The Four Sonnes of Aymon</HI1>; but I cannot admit Miss Octavia
Richardson's statement with regard to his 'piety.'  On the other
hand, I contend that he was as good and free a translator as any
of the 15th century, and in his style certainly not inferior to Peacock,
the greatest prosaist of his time.</P><P>What makes Caxton's style appear so awkward in the eyes of a
modern reader, is his repetitions, tautologies, and anacolutha.  But
these irregularities are, for the most part, conscious sins, committed
not only by him, but also by all the writers of his time.  Read the
following sentences from Malory, whose like never occurs in <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>
or <HI1 REND="i">Aymon</HI1>, and you will admit that Caxton was a very able
translator, for his time:—</P><P>Well, saide Merlyn / I knowe whome thou sekest / for thou sekest

original as closely as possible; but so far as I am aware, there is no
ground whatever for supposing that he slavishly sacrificed the genius
of his native language to Latin or French.  It will be seen by the
Introduction that Caxton's Syntax is essentially English, as much so
as that of Chaucer and Gower; his arrangement of words is, in spite
of his original, truly Saxon; and even in his introduction of foreign
words, he only continued what the preceding centuries had begun.</P><P>There are a very few decided Frenchisms in <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn</HI1>; but
these are rather slips of the pen, than intended or conscious innovations.
Such are require, demand, governing the dative case, see § 6,
p. xxiii; swear, with the accusative, see § 7, p. xxiv, A; the article
used in the vocative case, § 7, a; the his, § 7, b, p. xxvi.  Cf. Dr.
Furnivall, Introduction to <HI1 REND="i">Eneydos</HI1>, p. xix.</P><P>As strong evidence against Miss Richardson's opinion, I quote
the fact that there is not one instance of the French <FOREIGN LANG="fre">moi</FOREIGN> = I being
translated by 'me'!  See § 4, p. xi.  With regard to Caxton's
style, its main feature is the tiresome tautology, which is apparently
produced by the translator's desire to make as much as he could of
his work, to render it as showy as possible;<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.31">Compare the American girl who liked creaky shoes because they announced her coming and made folk look at her.</NOTE1> his whole age was
affected by this fashion of intolerable verbosity: to convey an idea
through the medium of as many words as possible was considered as
a beauty of style.</P><P>This appears first in the choice of words.  Generally, one French
expression is rendered by two consecutive synonyms; sometimes the
first of these is the word of the original, sometimes another; sometimes
one is French, the other Saxon; sometimes one strange, the other

French Romance, <HI1 REND="i">Blancandin et L'Orgueilleuse d'Amour</HI1>, from the
MS. 375 in Paris, and the Addit. MS. British Museum.  The Poem
had before been analyzed by Emile Littré in the <HI1 REND="i">Histoire littéraire</HI1>
tome xxii (1852), pp. 765—778, and Henry Ward has described the
Museum MS. in his <HI1 REND="i">Catalogue of Romances</HI1> in the B. Mus. (1883) i. 727-8.  He says:—</P><EPB/><PB N="cxvii" ID="pb.118"/><P>BLANCHANDIN ET ORGUEILLOSE D'AMORS.  A poem of adventures,
in about 4800 octosyllabic lines.  French.  'Blanchandin is the son
of a king of "Frise" (Phrygia?).  He has been kept in ignorance of
chivalry, till he sees some figures upon a tapestry.  He steals away
from home, and, after a ſew adventures, kisses Orgueillose d'Amors,
the Princess of Tormadai (apparently in or near Syria), out of sheer
bravado.  Her indignation is before long changed into affection.
She is besieged by another suitor.  Blanchandin is taken prisoner.
He is shipwrecked on the coast of India.  In the end he returns to
Tormadai with Indian allies under a Prince Sadoine, and they relieve
Orgueillose d'Amors.'</P><P>M. Michelant thus sketches the contents of the earliest version
of the story in the St. Germain MS. 1239, of the 13th century,
which contains 4,826 lines (p. v—vii):—</P><P>'Blancandin has fled from his Father's court—where the practice
of arms was forbidden him—to seek adventures abroad.  On his road,
a knight advises him to go and kiss, in the midst of her retinue, the
beauteous <FOREIGN LANG="fre">Orgueilleuse d'amour</FOREIGN>, whose name denotes her character.
This audacious deed stirs most highly the wrath of the young
princess.  She vows she will take astounding vengeance on the
culprit, who has fled.  She recognises him next day in the middle of
a tourney where he carries off the prize; but the valour and good
looks of the young knight make love supplant hatred in her heart;
and the two lovers have just avowed their mutual feelings, when an
old Saracen king (Alimodes) arrives, who besieges <FOREIGN LANG="fre">l'Orgueilleuse
d'amour</FOREIGN>, to force her to marry him, in spite of her repeated refusals.
Blancandin offers to defend her, and distinguishes himself in the
fight; but, overpowered by numbers, is taken prisoner.  In vain is
the highest ransom offered to the Saracen king.  He has sworn the
death of his rival, and sends him captive to a King of the Indies,
whose brother, Blancandin had slain in battle.</P><P>'During the voyage, a storm rises, which wrecks the vessel, and
Blancandin alone escapes.  He arrives safe and sound at the court of
a certain King of Athens, who is besieged by a powerful enemy.
Blancandin offers his services to the King, and frees him.  The King,
from gratitude, wishes to marry Blancandin [to his daughter?], but
Blancandin, faithful to 'the Lady-proud-in-love,' refuses.  He conſides
his secret to the King's son (Sadoine), with whom he is bound
in firm friendship, and both embark to succour the still-besieged
Princess.  At sea, they meet some of her folk; and Blancandin, without
making himself known, charges them to announce his speedy
arrival, for the purpose of delivering her.  But, in very sight of the
harbour, a tempest drives them away, and Blancandin takes advantage
of the terror of his companions, to convert and baptise them.  He
lands, with his friend Sadoine, in the very kingdom of the Prince<EPB/><PB N="cxviii" ID="pb.119"/>
(Alimodes) who was besieging the Lady-proud-in-love, where his own
Father was moaning in the direst captivity.  Blancandin promises to
give Sadoine in marriage the daughter of King Alimodes, a young
and beautiful Saraceness who, in the customary way, at first sight
falls in love with the Knight (Sadoine), whom she sees out hunting.
Blancandin takes the city, kills the King's son Darie, gives his sister
in marriage to his friend Sadoine, and sets his own father free.  Then
all retake the road to Tormaday, where the Lady-proud-in-love is
besieged.  She sends her Provost to know who the new-comers are,
and to ask them for help.  The Provost—who had formerly been
Blancandin's host—recognises him, and announces his arrival to the
Lady-proud.  She wants to prepare a brilliant reception for him,
while his foe Alimodes, on his side, makes ready for battle.  In the
middle of the fight, the Lady-proud, to encourage Blancandin, sends
him her sleeve on the point of a spear; he redoubles his efforts, and
puts his rival to flight.  Alimodes re-embarks in all haste.  And
the two lovers, united at last, after so many thwartings, celebrate
their marriage; and the wedding ended, every one, says the poet in
concluding, goes home, <Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><FOREIGN LANG="fre">S'en vet en sa contrée.'</FOREIGN></Q1></P><P>The end of the text is—<HI1 REND="i">Michelant</HI1>, p. 208:—</P><P><FOREIGN LANG="fre"><Q1 DIRECT="UNSPECIFIED"><L ID="l.283">Et quant la messe fut chantée,</L><L ID="l.284">Tuit s'en vont en la tor quarrée.</L><L ID="l.285">Mult i ot harpes et vieles,</L><L ID="l.286">Et tantes melodies beles:</L><L ID="l.287">Tuit li baron del païs né,</L><L ID="l.288">Iiii jors i sont séjorné.</L><L ID="l.289" REND="indent">Au quint departent lor mesniée,</L><L ID="l.290">En lor terre l'ont envoiée.</L><L ID="l.291">Le roi de Frise s'en revet,</L><L ID="l.292">Et en sa contrée s'en vet.</L><L ID="l.293">Arriere s'en revet Sadoine,</L><L ID="l.294">A sa moiller en Cassidoine,</L><L ID="l.295">Des or a Blanchandins amie,</L><L ID="l.296">Sage et proz sans vilenie.</L><L ID="l.297">Blanchandins est sires et dus:</L><L ID="l.298">Li romans faut; je n'en sai plus.</L><L ID="l.299">Explicit de B. et de O.</L></Q1></FOREIGN></P><P>This, says M.

is thus told by M. Michelant on pages viii, ix, of his edition:—</P><P>'In the fight which ended in raising the siege of Tormadai,
Sadoine, who had slain the brother of Alimodes, was taken prisoner
by the latter, and sent to Cassidonie [Chalcedony], to be there put to
death.  Blancandin sets out to succour his friend, and delivers him
at the moment he was to be strung up on a gallows, notwithstanding
the prayers of the daughter of Alimodes, who begged in vain for
pardon for her spouse.  Alimodes is conquered again.  But, during
the absence of Blancandin, his Seneschal—in whose guard he had
left the Lady-proud-in-love—gets together the chief Lords of the
country, and plots with them to carry off at once both the Crown
and Love of Blancandin, that he, the Seneschal, may force her to
marry him.  Two vassals who remain faithful, conduct Orgueilleuse
to a castle, where the treacherous Seneschal besieges them.  They,
however, find means to warn Blancandin, who hastens to return to
Tormadai to revenge himself.  The traitor flees,—pursued closely by
Blancandin and his friend Sadoine,—and takes refuge at a neighbouring
brigand's, where he hopes to get rid of the two knights who
have isolated themselves in the ardour of their pursuit.  They, though
received with apparent good-will, suspect a snare; they persist in
keeping their arms, in spite of the most pressing invitations to give
them up; and, seizing on a favourable moment, they cut to pieces
the band of robbers, and carry off their leader and the Seneschal,
whom they punish with death.  After this exploit, Blancandin
returns to Tormadai, where he celebrates his nuptials and those of
his friend Sadoine, with the greatest magnificence.'</P><P>Such, says M. Michelant, is the new ending of the poem in the
MSS. of Turin and the French National Library, 375.  The differences
of it in these MSS. consist only in this, that in the Turin MS.

the first interview of the two lovers, and the combats which precede
the taking of Cassidonie are treated at greater length, and with details
which are not found in the other version.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.33">Does not this point to the Turin version being the later of the two?</NOTE1></P><P>The chapter-headings do not agree, word for word, with Caxton's.
They divide the Story into 3 Parts, and differ in expression, as the
englishing of a few below will show:—</P><P>This present book contains 3 Treatises, of which the First

and how he fought his Host; how and by what means he recovered
the good-will of the Proud-Lady-of-Love, and of the imprisonment

tells of the sharp grief that the Proud-Lady-of-Love made on account
of the aforesaid kiss; of the arguments between her, and her mistress
who comforted her (ab. line 710 of the Verse-text).</P><P>The 2nd Chapter speaks of the threats of the Lady-Proud-in-Love
to Blanchendin, and how Blanchendin came to Tourmaday to lodge;
of the Provost, and the verses which he found on the Provost's door
(line 781 of the Verse-text).…</P><P>The 16th Chapter tells how Blanchendin slew the King of the

refusal of Allimodes, and how he had Blanchendin shipt off (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">fist

had Blanchendin shipt off; and how, by chance, he (Blanchendin)
was saved from the dangers of the sea, and pretended to be a
Saracen (line 2119 of the Verse-text).</P><P>The 2nd Chapter tells how Blanchendin was retained by the
King of Athens, and brought to good end (<FOREIGN LANG="fre">lui acheva</FOREIGN>) a war that

only copy—there are, in the present edition, two long specimens
under Caxton's text.  Part I. of ed. 1597 is at Hamburg.</P></Q1><P>The shortest, and therefore the most ancient, version of <HI1 REND="i">Blanchardyn
and Eglantyne</HI1> is that contained in the MS. 19,152 of the
National Library at Paris.  In it the poet is kind enough to marry
both Blanchardyn and Sadoyne after their return from Cassidonie,
where they have killed Darie, the son of Alymodes, and conquered
the entire kingdom.  The whole story answers to Caxton's chapters
1—42, and half of 43.</P><P>The Paris MS. 375, and that at Turin, add the taking of Sadoyne
in the Castle, Blanchardyn's setting out in order to save him and
the treason of Subion, as related by Caxton in chapters 43—56.</P><P>Thus far the report of M. Michelant, in his edition of <HI1 REND="i">Blancandin
et L'Orgueilleuse d'Amour</HI1> (Paris, Librairie Tross, 1867), is right.
But with regard to the prose versions he commits a very gross
mistake.  He believes the two only extant prose versions to be one
and the same.  After having given a description of the Brussels
MS. he, referring to a short note dedicated to an unknown gentleman,
says:—</P><P><FOREIGN LANG="fre">'Nous crayons qu'il est ici question du Duc de Bourgogne,
Philippe le Bel, qui à fait faire bon nombre de ces translations,
notamment celles de Siperis, d'Hélène, d'Eric et Enite, que l'on
trouve dans la même bibliothèque, bien que le second exemplaire de
cette translation semble infirmer notre hypothèse.  Ce dernier fait
partie du fonds de Sorbonne No. 466, petit in-folio sur papier, aux
armes de Richelieu, de cent cinq feuillets à longues lignes, d'une
écriture du xve siècle, qui paraît postérieure à l'autre MS. La table
dont la première manque, contient en tout 54 chapitres sans division
de livres; elle diffère de la précédente bien que roman offre le même
texte.'</FOREIGN></P><P>I really cannot conceive how the editor could venture to put
forward such a fallacy.  The prose MS. of the Brussels Library has<EPB/><PB N="cxxv" ID="pb.126"/>
not the least connection with that of Paris.  They are quite independent
of each other, and differ not only in the Tables of Contents,
but also in the text.  The Brussels MS. is a brief abstract of the
story,—as Michelant might have seen by the small number of leaves,
—while the Paris prose version is a full rendering of the romance.
Besides this, the former agrees with the poetic version as printed by
M. Michelant, in every name, while the latter, or Paris MS., exhibits
a most important alteration in the names of persons and places.</P><P>In the Brussels MS., as well as in Michelant's edition, Blanchardyn
kills Rubion, the '<FOREIGN LANG="fre">roy des Gaians</FOREIGN>,' and is sent by Alymodes
to Salmandrie.  During a storm he escapes, and comes to the shore
of Athens.  He presents himself to the king Ruban, who makes him
'senechal' of his army, against his enemy <FOREIGN LANG="fre">Escamor de Beaudaire</FOREIGN>.</P><P>This is quite different in the Paris MS., in which Blanchardyn
is cast on the shore of Prussia, and comes to Marienburg.  The
king of Prussia is pleased with him, and appoints him (Blanchardyn)
head-captain of his army.  Meanwhile a wounded knight
arrives with the news that the king of Poland has invaded Prussia.
Blanchardyn, with Sadoyne, is sent against the Poles, and Blanchardyn
unhorses the king, who gives himself up as a prisoner.</P><P>What induced the author of the Paris prose version to alter
Athens into Marienburg?  Probably he wanted a country better
known to the people of that time as a scene of constant war, and in
this respect his choice was very well made.  After the Crusades to
the Holy Sepulchre had lost their charms, the knights of England
and France very often joined their colleagues of the Teutonic order,
who were in a state of constant warfare with their heathen neighbours
in Lettow (Lithuania), Ruce (Russia), and elsewbere.  Compare

But force was to hym to obeye her commaundement,
wherof al they that thenne were wythin the chambre

coude, Wyth a lowe voyce she sayde vnto blanchardyn:
'Syre, ye knowe the werre that the vntrewe kynge

manere, and remembred hym self of the wordes that his

to þe lady: 'Madame, myn hoste hath tolde me this

Alas, why dyde he tary hym self for to slee that

by the light of the Moone, tooke their way to Castelford,
which was distance thence foure miles; Sadony
leading the way, Subbion in the middest, and Blanchardine
the hindmost.  They posted so fast, that within
short time they came before the gate of the Castell,
where they allighted from their horses; then knocking
at the gates, they were presently knowne, and with
all speed let in, leading Subbion betweene them.  the

the noble Knights and Burgises of Tormaday: the
walles were hanged with tapestry, the streets were
strewed with rushes and sweet smelling roses, to gratulate
their comming; the matrons compiling garlands of
sundry flowers, the Ladyes dauncing, the damsels singing,
the musicke sounding a sweet concordance to their
entrie.  Thus in tryumph they assended the princely
pallace, most sumpteously adorned with rich cloth of

Blanchardine, but also brought such honorable presentes

to congratulate the happie mariage betweene him and
the faire Princesse Eglantine, as their Countries and
kingdomes did afford.  Some presented him with
stately coursers and Iennets of seruice, some with ships
of huge and mightie burthen, some with Pearles and
Iuels of inestimable valure.  And to be short, euery
one, though at first his foe and vtter enemie, yet in

his true and faithful freends, esteeming him worthy of

playes, and Princely deuises, spent the time till they
went to bed.</P><P>On the morrow the feast began a-fresh, and continued
for the space of twentie daies.  After all which<EPB/><PB N="212" ID="pb.383"/>
arroyalties were finysh-<MILESTONE N="I 3" UNIT="sign."/>ed by the commandement of
Blanchardine, was Subyon and all his accomplices
brought to execution.  now the neues being caried
with the swift wings of fame into Frizeland, the
Lords of Frize repaired to Tormaday, to accompany
home their aged King, and to congratulate this happy
marriage of Blanchardine and his new Queene.</P><P>After the aged King of Frize, Father to Blanchardine,
had seene the espousalls of this beautifull
Queene and his noble Sonne; being decrepit &amp; stiffe
with age, hauing liued to fourscore and vpward, vnto
whome, although his late enlargement from captiuitie,
and this new-come ioy of his deere sonne Blanchardine,
being now married to the beautifull Queene of Tormaday,
bred delight; Yet through debillitie of nature,
which was sore infeebled by his hard imprisonment, he
was surprised with an vncoth malladie and extreame
contagion of dangerous sicknes; in the which he had
not long remained, but in the view of all, life began to
vade, and death opproche.  And more to hasten on
deathes speedy pace to this sencles olde man, the
nobles of Frizeland, hauing receiued sure and certaine
inteligence from Tormaday of the life and freedome of
their King at that time there, and the princely mariage
which now was fully concluded betweene his successiue
heire, their naturall leige Blanchardine, with the renouned
Lady and Queene of Tormaday, they came
thither; at whose approche, this fainting olde man,
hoping to receiue glad tidings from his aged wife the
Queene of Frize, began with cheerefull countenance to
lift himselfe vp in his bed, as though no kinde of<EPB/><PB N="213" ID="pb.384"/>
deadly malladie or aged griefe had attainted his
withered limbes.  But when he had a while listened
to the sweet harmonie of their sugred speach, which
presaged no kind of disaster, but all pleasure and
sollace that might be, at the length he demaunded of
the welfare of the aged Queene his wife; vnto whome,
reply being made, that long time since, vpon the vnfortunate
report and tragicall tidings of his captiuitie by
Darius, sonne to the Pagan king Alimodes, shee fell
sicke and died; hee, listening to this impittious tale,
fell as one distraught into a sound.  But comming to
himselfe, powred forth these speeches, <MILESTONE N="I 3, back" UNIT="sign."/>the true testimonies
of his faithfull loue: 'and is she gon, the
comfort of my youth, the staffe of my age, the day of
my night, the sonshine of my blisse, the sollace of my
soule, and the life of my death?  Ah! to to well I suspected
(though alas I knew not the certentie) that my
captiuitie would bring her callamity, and my imprisonment
her death.  But since all humane flesh is mortall,
and nothing vnder the Sunne permanent, what auailes
my sorowful grones and passions?  to weake, alas, to
recall her againe, or any way to remedie my misfortune!'
with these or the like exclaimes, this silly aged
King, panting betweene life and death, lay still a while,
till finding his heart ouer charged with an other passion,
he prosecuted his first complaint: 'O sacred Ioue,
searcher of all secret thoughts, whose eternall dietie
raigneth within the highest heauens, who from my
cradle hast destined me to perpetuall miserie, now shew
thy self a righteous iudge, and reuenge my wronges<EPB/><PB N="214" ID="pb.385"/>
vppon the accursed broode of infidels, who so irreligiously
prophane thy blessed name, &amp; suffer them not to
escape thy reuenging powre, but at thy pleasure consume
and confound the workers of this my woe! and
now dissolue my daies and weary life, &amp; leade me
through th' unknowne passages to my deere and
sweetest wife, that though our daies on earth did finde
small comfort, yet our soules in heauen may finde consolation.'
And with this orizon he yeilded himself to
God, and died.  When the brute of this heauie tidinges
came to the eares of Blanchardine and his faire Queene,
although they swume before in the hauen of happines,
and floted on the floodes of al felicitie (as they thought),
yet in that very instant and moment of time, a cloudie
mist began to obscure their brightest sonshine, and a
frost of cares to ouer runne their summers blisse.</P><P>Now began Blanchardine to accuse and condemne
himselfe of vnnaturall ingratitude and disobedience to
his parentes, to whome both nature and dutie bound
him to bee submissiue and kind; now he began to
maligne the time, the place, and the cause of his departure
and priuie escape from his fathers Court.  But
all in vaine, for as teares, praiers, nor vowes can recall
the dead: so had I wist, and time abused and mispent,
is in vaine to <MILESTONE N="I 4" UNIT="sign."/>be desired.  'And yet (quoth he) how
vnnaturall was I to forsake them whome nature charged
me to loue and obey! now I may iustlie accuse my self
of the murther of these my louing parents: alas! I cannot
excuse my selfe, neither can I plead ignoraunce that
I knew not that my departure would be the finishing
of my parentes ioyes, and cause of their death, which
now (to my open shame) I finde most true.  And
should I, nay, could I, suffer my selfe to be led and
carried away with such vaine fantasies, as leaue them<EPB/><PB N="215" ID="pb.386"/>
comfortles to whome I was the greatest comfort.  Die,
Blanchardine, die! and the rather die, that art the cause
of thy parents death: alas! to kill a man is hainous
murder; but to murder my parentes, a sinne against
Sanctitie: all creatures haue care to foster those that
gaue them life; and I, careles in killing my father.
The Storke, when he seeth his sire olde &amp; redy to die
with famine, taketh him vpon his shoulders, and feedeth
him by his trauaile: But I, insteede of feeding, haue
famisht, and in place of trauelling, haue traiterously
ouerthrowne my parents.'</P><P>The Lordes of Tormaday, seeing this soddaine and
vnexpected chaunce of the death of the aged King, &amp;
the heauie plight of Blanchardine and his beautifull
Quéene, humbly on their knees began to expostulate
him in this manner: 'Noble prince! as the salue commeth
to late, where the sore is irrecuperable; as phisicke
is naught worth where the pacient is passing; and as
fire giuen to the ordinance, tis to late to recall the
shot; So, mightie King, booteles are these teares which
are shed for the dead.  the honor of your father hath
eterniz'd his name for euer, though his body be here
interred; and if fame be the marke whereat all noble
mindes do shoote, then may you boast that he cannot
die whose fame is so ferre spred throughout the world.
Leaue therefore (braue King) to bewaile him whome
you haue cause to ioy for, and comfort our pensiue
Queene and your faire spouse, whose torments cannot
cease, seeing you so sad.'  As one newly risen from a
traunce, or out of a heauy slumber, so Blanchardine,
hauing listened to this short and sweete discourse of his
nobles, began to recall his sences home, which before
were wandring after the Ghost of his father, through<EPB/><PB N="216" ID="pb.387"/>
the Elizian feeldes, and <MILESTONE N="I 4, back" UNIT="sign."/>perceiuing sorrow to be both
needlesse and bootlesse, so well as the time and this
hard occasion would permit, he began to be more
cheereful; and so pacing toward the Queene with a
simpering smile, neither presaging mirth nor mourning,
he began to recomfort her: 'How now, faire loue?
what, are your melancholies such as nothing can make
you merrie? sweete hart, be pacified, and shake of these
vntimelye passions, and learne by me to disgest the
hard and harsh pilles of vnhappie fortune.  The cause
is mine; and if sorrow be expected in any, it is I that
must be sorrowful; but I haue found it both hurtfull to
my body and [not] auailable<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.461">? unavailable</NOTE1> to the dead, and therefore
haue shaken it of as a thing of no regarde.  Let vs not
therefore (sweete wife) be the cause of a mournfull
courte, but the authors of merry company, since it hath
pleased God to sorte our haps to our harts contentments
in our happy wedding.'  The Queene, whose sadnes
grew by reason of her husbands heauinesse, seeing him
to haue so quickly dismissed his heauy passions, became
presentlye iocond &amp; merry; &amp; so betweene them
commaunded great preparation to be forthwith made, to
performe the obsequies of the deceased King of Freeze,
his Father; which shortly, with all solemnitie fitting
his estate, was accomplished, to the great admiration of
all beholders, for the sumptuous magnificencie and surpassing
pompe wherwith he was interred; all costly
odors and sweet senting spices were bountifully bestowed<EPB/><PB N="217" ID="pb.388"/>
vpon him; great almes and charity were dealt
and distributed; and innumerable sollemne processions
&amp; praiers were made for him, in honor of his person
dead, and loue of his Sonne liuing.</P><P>Now Sadonie, who was not only a beholder, but a
principall actor in all this heauy tragedie, after these
obsequies were solemnized, and that the estate of his
sworne freend Blanchardine and his faire Queene rested
in perfect quiet, voyde and free both of forraine and
domesticall enimies, bethinking himselfe of his beautifull
Beautrix, his trusty Regent of Cassidony (hee, I
say) whome loue had stonge to the quicke by his late
marriage, comming to Blanchardine, began thus: 'Since,
Noble freend, and true copartner of all mishaps, that
fortune hath spit her deadly spight, <MILESTONE N="K 1" UNIT="sign."/>and that now
there remaineth no more seruice for me to doe in defence
of your royall person, your Realme and Queene;
and that my princely Queene languisheth at home, by
reason of my long absence, whose princely person is
the true Idea of my thought; let me craue fauor to
depart, vntill occasion or your freendly letters call me
hether againe, where and when I will not faile, so long
as life shall rest within me, to do you all possible fauor
and kindnes.'  Blanchardine (imagining by himselfe)
that the Sting of loue was a sufficient pricke to call
Sadony home, and that he should greatly iniury him &amp;
his faire Beautrix, in withholding them a sunder; not
onely gaue his consent for his departure, but with all
honor accompanied him to his ships, with his Princely
Eglantine, where, not without millions of teares and
many kind imbracements, they parted companie.</P><P>Thus with pleasant gale and quiet tide, Neptune<EPB/><PB N="218" ID="pb.389"/>
guiding the healme, sayled Sadony and his warlike companie
towardes the Realme of Cassidony, where his
princely Queene, the beautifull Beautrix, held her
Royall court, but heauy and mournfull for the absence
of her Lorde and husband Sadony; for wrathfull
Nemisis, enuying of her good hap, and willing to heape
greater woes vpon the Queene, then before shee suspected,
altered her hoped blisse into a deadly bane.
For when the calme silence of the night procured quiet
to all liuing creatures, and that Hesperus, the harbenger
of Cinthia, had giuen charge to call the inferior stars
with twinkling light to illumine the earth; Eolus on
the sodaine began to roare, and with outragious stormes
and cruell blastes to bannish againe the starrs from the
firmament, &amp; in their places to spred his dusky clouds,
so that instead of light there was obscuritie, with huge
and horible crakes of thuunder: By force whereof, the
wandering Prince Sadony and his amazed company
were, from a sodaine hope of happy arriuall, driuen
into a dismall feare of drowning: then began the pittifull
clamor of the people, seeing euery waue ready to
swallow up the ship wherein they were caried, the foggy
mist to thicken with cloudy vapors, that vnneth could
the saylors see to doe their labours.  Sadony (whose
corage no fortune was able to daunt) ha-<MILESTONE N="K 1, back" UNIT="sign."/>uing his assured
hope in the God whome Blanchardine made him to
know, seeing his company to faint and in dispaire,
began to exhort and comfort them in this sort:</P><P>'Trustie companion[s] and copartners of mishap,
since it hath pleased the maiestie of the eternall God
to terrifie with his thunderclaps our feeble hearts, and
that all hope of safetie is vtterly denied; let vs with
one consent humble our selues before his mercy seat;
and no doubt, as in many other our calamities, so in
this our desperate distress, he will with the eyes of
pitty looke downe vpon our penitencie, and by his<EPB/><PB N="219" ID="pb.390"/>
omnipotency appease the rage of these troubled seas,
which threateneth imminent death and destruction.
Frollike, deere friends! and the God of Blanchardine
defend us!'  The company seeing Sadonie so coragious
and full of haughtie valor, inciting them to call vpon
the God of Blanchardine, euery one casting away his
dastard feare, eleuating their hearts and hands to
heauen, made their orizons thus: 'Imortall Iehoua,
guider of this glorious roume! although our dim-sighted
eies haue been long couered with the obscure vaile of
ignorance, &amp; haue abandoned our hearts from thy
sacred law, yet since it hath pleased thee to make thy
name and glorie knowne among vs, suffer vs not to
miscarie, vntill wee haue yeelded thee all conding and
heauenly honor, so that from our lips thy praise may
flow, and in our hearts thy diety take roote!'  No
sooner was this short &amp; zealous praier finished, but
horned Luna began to shew her head, the cloudes to
vanish, the windes to cease, and the sea to calme,
which yeelded such fuell to their faith, that for euer
they acknowledged the omnipotence of Blanchardines
God, and left the same to their posterities.  Then the
skilfull Pilots, whose wandring course was past their
compasse, looking to the skyes, were directed a true
passage by a christall starre, so that within short time
they reacht the shore of Cassidony, where the beautifull
Beautrix, with her Lordly Peeres and Princely
Ladies, awaited their landing.  When Sadony was<EPB/><PB N="220" ID="pb.391"/>
now escaped the danger of the sea, and safely come
a shore, after humble thankes to God, he seazing vpon
the rosiall lips of his royall Queene, in whose countenance
snow and blood made such a mixture, that in<MILESTONE N="K 2" UNIT="sign."/>
the opinion of all, if nature should deuise to frame
her paragon she might fayle in perfection.  But after
many kinde curtesies and amiable imbracements betweene
Sadony and his Beautrix, and the Lordes and
Ladies, where euery one stroue with kindnes to welcome
home her loue, they repaired to the court, where,
for that night, the King and his Queene spent the time
in content, and al the rest congratulated their happy
meetings.  On the morrow, when glorious Phœbus
began to cut the cloudes, and drewe the darknes from
the earth, every one prepared himselfe to be ready to
attend the princes pleasure.</P><P>After Sadony had royally presented himselfe to the
veiw of all, giuing a princely boniure to the Lordes
and nobles, he commaunded that the soldiers, whose
trauels had beene great, should repaire to his presence,
to receiue a recompence for their paines; which bountie
did so combine the trustie minds of all vnto him, that
base was he accompted, that would refuse to hazard his
life where and when it pleased Sadony to commaund.
Then were the lawes, which in his absence the Quéene
and Counsell had deuised, presented to him to ratifie,
which he with all princely magnificencie did forthwith
establish, to the great admiration and singuler content
of all his subiectes and people.  Now tatling swiftwinged
fame, the speedy messenger of happie newes,
ceased not vntil these tidinges were brought to the
eares of the King of Spruse at the cittie Marienbourgh
(then in his profound and deep meditations for his
sonne Sadony), and his departed companion.  But
when he heard of the hard aduentures which his sonne
had escaped by sea, his deliuerie from death on land,<EPB/><PB N="221" ID="pb.392"/>
and his most happy marriage with the beautifull
Beautrix, banishing feare (whose cankering rust had
almost consumed his pleasure) hee, with all his nobles
and people, offered burnt sacrifices to their Mahon for
this happie tidings.  Yet not content nor satisfied in
minde, he rigged certaine ships, wherein he and diuers
of his Lordes embarqued themselues, longing to visite
his son at Cassidonie; and led by this sweete desire,
after they had sayled the space of one weeke, they
came ashore within those territories.  But when newes
was brought to Sadony that certaine <MILESTONE N="K 2, back" UNIT="sign."/>Pagans were
arriued, and craued to bee admitted his princely presence:
Ignorant altogether what or whence they
shoulde be: seating himselfe in his Royall throne,
accompanied with his faire Queene and chiefe peeres,
hee commaunded them to bee brought to his presence,
vpon whose approche, Sadony knowing his father by the
maiestie of his countenaunce, desended from his seate,
humbling himselfe on his knées at his fathers feete.  The
faire Beautrix vnwitting who he might be, to whome
Sadony should shewe such reuerence, stood in a maze.
But after she knew him to be father to Sadony, with a
most gracious and amiable cheere came to entertaine
him; to whome the King of Spruse rendred millions
of thankes, both for the life and marriage of his
sonne, without whose rescue hee had bin traiterously
murdred, and hanged by Alimodes.  But the faire
Quéene answered, that both her life, liuing, and people
rested in the safetie of Sadony, 'without whome (quoth
shee) neythir may I, nor my kingdome, continue.'  Now
when the King of Spruse had listened to her zealous
and sugred tale, fixing a stedfast countenaunce on her
face, he seemed as one rauished in contemplation, admiring
the beauty and bounty of the Queene.  But Sadony,
thinking his father (after his ariual from sea) to be
desirous to repose himself, led him with all maiestie<EPB/><PB N="222" ID="pb.393"/>
into a most princely lodging; where after his repast, he
went to bed.  the other Lords of his troope, and all
their followers, were so honorably entertained there,
that the commendation of Sadonies bountie was bruted
euery where.  Now on the next morning, when (according
to custome) Sadony and his faire Queene repaired
to the Church to heare deuine seruice, the King of
Spruse not suspecting that his Sonne Sadony had
altered his religion from his Mahomet; after the
Priestes had begun to sing a sollemne procession in
the honor of Christ, he, as a man distraught in sence,
and ouercome with madding frenzy, ran vp and downe
cursing and exclaiming against his sonne, so that neither
perswasions, teares, vowes, nor praiers, might once appease
his franticke rage; till retiring himself all sollitary
into his chamber, tormented with passions &amp; agonies,
at length he fell a sleep; to whome, a little after, entred
diuers of the Lordes <MILESTONE N="K 3" UNIT="sign."/>which accompanied Sadonie from
Marienbrough with Blanchardine, and perswaded the
King that the idolatrous Mahomet was a false deceauer,
and of no diety, which by sundry and wonderfull
miracles, they had founde Christ to be the true Messias
and sonne of God; and, therefore, with all humilitie,
ioyntly on their knees, they entreated his maiestie to
leaue his superstitious worshipping of blockish Mahomet,
and with all deuotion to <CORR SIC="acknowledged">acknowledge</CORR> Christ to
be the true God.  And euen at that very instant the
stony heart of this Pagan King was mollified, who forsaking
his idolatrie, became a christian.  This happie
newes so delighted his sonne, that vnder heauen nothing
could make him more content.  Then laboured Sadony
and his faire Queene, with all royaltie, to welcome their
father and his followers, where their entertainment was
exceeding measure, both for magnificencie and cost.  So
past the time a moneth or more of their abode in iollity,<EPB/><PB N="223" ID="pb.394"/>
vntill the King, desirous to returne to Marienbourgh,
requested leaue of Sadony for his departure: who seeing
the tickle state of his fathers kingdome, in his absence,
wanting a gouernour there, was the more willing; and
so, all possible prouision being made, with princely
bounty bestowed by Sadony and his Beautrix vpon the
Lords of Spruse, they accompanied the King to his
ships.  And after humble dutie done by Sadony to his
father, and kinde curtesie to the rest, he recommended
them to the mercy of Blanchardines God.</P><TRAILER>Thus, Gentlemen, to satisfie your expectations, &amp;

though not according to the value, which is nothing, yet for the
dutifull deſire of the giuer, which is my moſt.  For in this I proteſt,
you may well decerne, that my willing minde dooth bewraie my good
