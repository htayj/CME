And thai diuersen in that the first kynge mey rule his peple bi suche lawes as he makyth hym self. And therfore he mey sett vppon thaim tayles and other imposicions, such as he wol hym self, with owt thair assent. The secounde kynge may not rule his peple bi other lawes than such as thai assenten unto. And therfore he mey sett vpon thaim non imposi|cions with owt thair owne assent. This diuersite is wel taught bi Seynt Thomas, in his boke wich he wrote ad regem Cipri de regemine principum. But yet it is more openly tredid in a boke callid compendium moralis philosophie, and sumwhat bi Giles in his boke de regemine principum. The childeryn of Israell, as saith Seynt Thomas, aftir that God hade chosen thaim in populum peculiarem et regnum sacerdotale, were ruled bi hym vndir Juges regaliter et politice, in to the tyme that thai desired to haue a kynge, as tho hade al the gentiles, wich we cal peynymes, that hade no kynge but a man that reigned vppon thaim regaliter tantum. With wich desire God was gretly offendyd, as wele for thair folie, as for thair vnkyndnes; that 
<EPB/><PB REF="00000134.tif" SEQ="00000134" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNS" CNF="999" N="110"/> sithyn thai had a kynge, wich was God, that reigned vppon thaim politekily and roialy, and yet wold chaunge hym for a kynge, a verray man, that wolde reigne vpon hem only roialy. And therfore God manassynge hem made them to be ferde bi thondres and oþer gasteful thynges from the hevene. And whan thai wolde not therby lefe thair folissh desire, he charged þe profet Samuel to declare vnto them the lawe of such a kynge as thai askyd; wich amonge oþer thynges said that he wolde take from thaim thair lande and gyf it to his servantes, and sett thair childeryn in his cartis, and do to thaim such oþer many harmeful thinges, as in the viij<HI1 REND="sup">th</HI1> chapiter of the first boke of kynges it mey apere. Wher as bi fore that tyme, while thai were ruled bi God roialy and politikely vndir Juges, it was not lefull to any man for to take from thaim any of thaire godis, or to greve thair childeren þat hade not offendid. Wereby it mey appere that in tho dayis regimen politicum et regale was distyngued a regemine tantum regale; and that it was bettir to the peple to be ruled politekely and roialy, than to be ruled only roialy. Seynt Thomas also in his said boke prasith dominium politicum et regale, bi cause the prince that reigneth bi such lordshippe mey not frely falle into tyrannye, as mey the prince that reigneth regaliter tantum. And yet thai both bith egall in estate and in poiar, as it mey lightly be shewed and provid by infallyble reason.

To this doute it mey be an|swerde in this maner. The first institucion of thes ij realmes vppon the incorperacion of thaim is cause of this diuersite. Whan Nembroth be myght for his owne glorie made and incorperate the first realme, and subdued it to hymself bi tyrannye, he wolde not have it gouernyd bi any oþer rule or lawe, but bi his owne wille; bi wich and for the accom|plisshment þerof he made it. And therfore though he hade thus made hym a realme, holy scripture disdeyned to call hym a kynge, quia rer dicitur a regendo; wich thynge he did not, but oppressyd the peple bi myght, and therfore he was a tirraunt and callid primus tirrannorum. But holy write callith hym robustus benator coram Domino. Ffor as the hunter takyth the wilde beste for to sle and ete hym, so Nembroth subdued to hym the peple with myght, to haue þer seruice and thair godis, vsing vppon thaim the lord|shippe that is callid dominium regale tantum.

Wich lawes ben right gode vndir gode princes, and thair kyngdomes bethe than most resembled to the kyngdome of God, wich reigneth vpon man rulynge hym bi his owne will. Wherfore mony cristen princes vsen the same lawe; and ther|fore it is that þe lawes seyn, quod principi placuit, legis habet bigorem. And thus I suppose first be gan in Realmes dominium tantum regale. But aftirwarde, whan mankynde was more mansuete, and bettir dis|posid to vertu, grete comunaltes, as was the felow|shippe that came in to this lande with Brute, willynge to be vnite and made a body pollitike callid a reawme, hauynge an hed to gouerne it;—as aftir the saynge of the philisopher, euery comunalte vnyed of mony parties must nedis haue an hed;—than they chese the same Brute to be þer hed and kynge. And thai and he vpon this incorperacion, institucion, and onynge of hem self in to a reaume, ordenyd the same reaume to be ruled and justified by suche lawes as thai all wolde assent vnto; wich lawe therfore is callid polliticum, and bi cause it is ministrid bi a kynge, it is callid regale. <HI1 REND="i">Policia dicitur a</HI1> poles, <HI1 REND="i">quod est plures, et</HI1> ycos, <HI1 REND="i">scientia; quo regimen politicum dicitur</HI1> regimen plurium scientia siue consilio ministratum.

And as Dio|dorus Siculus saith in is boke de priscis historiis, the reawme of Egipte is ruled bi the same lawe, and therfore the kynge therof chaungith not his lawes with owt the assent of his peple.

Now as me semyth it is shewid openly ynough, whi on kynge reignith vpon is peple dominio tantum regali, and that other reignith dominio politico et regali; ffor that on kyngdome be ganne of and bi the might of the prince, and that oþer be ganne bi the desire and institucion of the peple of the same prince.</P></DIV1><DIV1 NODE="AEW3422.0001.001:5" TYPE="chapter" N="3"><HEAD>CHAPTER III.

Werthurgh the Ffrench kynge hath not men of his owne reaume able to defende it, except his nobles, wich beyren non such imposicions, and ther fore thai ben right likely of thair bodies; bi wich cause the said kynge is compellid to make his armeys and retenues for the defence of his lande of straungers, as Scottes, Spaynardes, Arrogoners, men of Almeyn, and of oþer nacions, or ellis all his enymes myght ouerrenne hym; for he hath no defence of his owne except is castels and fortresses. Lo this is the frute of his Tus regale. Yf the reaume of Englonde, wich is an Ile, and therfor mey not lyghtly geyte soucore of other landes, were rulid vndir such a lawe, and vndir such a prince, it wolde be than a pray to all oþer nacions þat wolde conqwer, robbe, or deuouir it; wich was well provid in the tyme of the Bretons, when the Scottes and the Pyctes so bete and oppressid this lande, þat the peple therof sought helpe of the Romayns, to whom thai hade be tributori.

Wich werely doth the Ffrench kynge to mony a thowsande of his subiectes, as it is be fore openly declared. Wich thynge þough it be nowe colourid per jus regale, yet it is tyranne. Ffor, as Seynt Thomas saith, whan a kynge rulith his reaume only to his owne profite, and not to the good off is subiectes, he is a tyrant. Kynge Heroude reignid vppon þe Jues dominio regali; yet when he slowe the childeren off Israell, he was in that a tyrant, though the lawes seen, quod principi placuit, legis habet bigorem. Wherfore Acab, wich reigned vppon the childeren of Israell bi like lawe, and desired to haue hade Nabothe his subgectes vyne yerde, wolde not by that lawe take it ffrom hym, but proferid hym the value thereof. Ffor theys wordes seid to the pro|fete, predic eis jus regis, beth not ellis to say but, predic eis potestatem regis. Wher fore as ofte as such a kynge dothe any thynge ayenst the lawe of God, or ayenst þe lawe off nature, he dothe wronge, not with stondynge the said lawe declared by the prophete. And it is so, that the lawe off nature woll in this case, þat the kynge shulde do to his subgettes, has he wolde ben done to hym self, yff he were a subget; wich mey not be that he wolde be almost distroied as bith þe commons off Ffraunce.

Ffor indigens in ham is not only vnworshipfull, but it mey do the most harme þat mey falle of eny nede in any estate of the lande, aftir the kynges most grete estate. Þe thirde charge ordinarie is the payment of the kepyng of the marches, wher in we beyre moch gretter charges yerely than done the Scottis, wich often tymes is for the ffauour þat we do to the persones þat kepe ham, wich ffauoure þe Scottis do not.

Wherfore we nede in this case to vse coniecture and ymaginacion, as to thynk that þer is no lordis livelod in Englond sufficient to beyre the kynges extraordinare charges. Then nedith it þat the kynges livelod, aboff such reuenues as shalbe asseigned for his ordinare charges, be gretter than the livelod off the grettest lorde in Englande.

For than such a lord mey dispende more then the kynge, con|sideringe þat he is charged with no such charges extraordinarie or ordinarie as is the kyng, except an houshold, wich is but litle in comparison off the kynges house. Wherfore yff it be thus, it shalbe necessarie, þat ther be purveyid ffor the kyng moch gretter livelod than he hath yet.
