Many noble and dyuers gentylmen of thys royame of

whyche ought moost to be remembred emonge vs englysshe
men tofore al other crysten kynges / For it is notoyrly knowen
thorugh the vnyuersal world / that there been ix worthy &amp; the
best that euer were / That is to wete thre paynyms / thre Iewes
and thre crysten men / As for the paynyms they were tofore the

And that there ben in frensshe dyuers and many noble
volumes of his actes / and also of his knyghtes / To whome I
answerd / that dyuers men holde oppynyon / that there was
no suche Arthur / and that alle suche bookes as been maad of

neuer suche a kynge callyd Arthur / myght wel be aretted grete

xxiij chappytre/ where his body was buryed and after
founden and translated in to the sayd monasterye / ye shal se also
in thystorye of bochas in his book de casu principum / parte of
his noble actes / and also of his falle / Also galfrydus in
his brutysshe book recounteth his lyf / and in dyuers places
of Englond / many remembraunces ben yet of hym and shall
remayne perpetuelly / and also of his knyghtes / Fyrst in the
abbey of westmestre at saynt Edwardes shryne remayneth the
prynte of his seal in reed Waxe closed in beryll/ In whych is
wryton Patricius Arthurus / Britannie / Gallie / Germanie /
dacie / Imperator / Item in the castel of douer ye may see
Gauwayns skulle / &amp; Cradoks mantle . At wynchester the rounde
table / in other places Launcelottes swerde and many other
thynges / Thenne al these thynges consydered there can no man
resonably gaynsaye but there was a kyng of thys lande
named Arthur / For in al places crysten and hethen he is
reputed and taken for one of the ix worthy / And the fyrst of
the thre Crysten men / And also he is more spoken of beyonde
the see moo boookes made of his noble actes than there be in
englond as wel in duche ytalyen spaynysshe and grekysshe as

repenteth me that I maye not doo batail for my wyf / for as I deme
this dede came neuer by her / And therfore I suppose she shalle
not be alle distayned / but that somme good knyght shal putt
his body in Ieopardy for my quene rather than she shal be

and god spede the ryght / And yf hit so falle that there be no

Thenne I wille counceyle yow sayd the kynge and vnto sire

that ony man may requyre me / And wete ye wel yf I
graunte to doo bataille for the quene I shall wrathe many of my

wille graunte my lord / that for my lord sir launcelots sake &amp;
for your sake I wille at that daye be the quenes champyon /
onles that there come by aduenture a better knyghte than I

kynge by your feythe / ye sir said sir Bors / of that I will not
fayle yow / nor her bothe / but yf there came a better knyghte than
I am / and thenne shalle he haue the bataille / Thenne was the
kynge and the quene passyng gladde / and soo departed / and
thanked hym hertely / Soo thenne sir Bors departed secretely
vpon a day / and rode vnto sire launcelot there as he was wyth
the heremyte sir Brastias / &amp; told hym of all theire aduenture
A Ihesu said sir Launcelot this is come happely as I wold
haue hit / and therfor I praye yow make you redy to doo
bataille / but loke that ye tary tyl ye see me come as longe as ye
may / For I am sure Mador is an hote knyghte whan he is
enchaufed / for the more ye suffre hym the hastyer wille he be to
batail / syr said Bors lete me dele with hym / Doubte ye not ye
shalle haue alle your wille / thenne departed syre Bors from
hym / and came to the Courte ageyne / Thenne was hit noysed
in alle the Courte that sir Bors shold doo bataill for the
quene / wherfore many knyghtes were displeasyd with hym / that
he wold take vpon hym to doo batail in the quenes quarel for
there were but fewe knyghtes in all the courte but they demed
the quene was in the wronge / and that she had done that
treason / Soo sire Bors ansuerd thus to his felawes of the table
round / Wete ye wel my fayre lordes it were shame to vs alle
and we suffred to see the moost noble quene of the world to be
shamed openly consyderynge her lord / and our lord is the man
of moost worship in the world &amp; moost crystend / and he hath
euer worshipped vs alle in al places / Many ansuerd hym

and honoure hym as wel as ye doo / but as for quene Gueneuer
<EPB/><PB N="733" ID="pb.733"/><MILESTONE N="367r" UNIT="leaf"/>
we loue her not by cause she is a destroyer of good knyghtes
Faire lordes sayd sir Bors me semeth ye saye not as ye shold
say / for neuer yet in my dayes knewe I neuer nor herd saye/
that euer she was a destroyer of ony good knyghte / But att
alle tymes as ferre as euer I coude knowe / she was a
mayntener of good knyghtes / and euer she hath ben large and free
of her goodes to alle good knyghtes / and the moost
bounteuous lady of her yeftes and her good grace that euer I sawe or
herd speke of / And there for it were shame said sire Bors to
vs all to our most noble kynges wyf / &amp; we suffred her to be
shamefully slayne / And wete ye wel sayd sire Bors I wylle
not suffer it / for I dare say soo moche the quene is not gylty
of sir Patryse dethe / for she owed hym neuer none ylle wylle/
nor none of the four and twenty knyghtes that were at that
dyner / for I dar saye / for good loue she bad vs to dyner / and
not for no male engyne / and that I doubte not shalle be

for to goo to London to bye alle manere of thynges that

Syr Mordred trusted hyr wel ynough / and gaf her leue to

For than was the comyn voys emonge them that wyth
