hadde ben in helle, and had take oute Adam and Eve, and
other at his plesier; and whan the fendes sien that, they hadden
right grete feer and gret merveile; thei assembleden to-gedir,
and seiden, "What is he this thus vs supprisith and
distroyeth, in so moche that our strengthes ne nought ellis that we
haue may nought with-holde hym, nor again hym stonde in no
diffence; but that he doth all that hym lyketh, we ne trowe not
that eny man myght be bore of woman, but that he sholde ben

and seide, "He this hath distroyed that which we wende sholde

seiden, how that god shulde come in to erthe for to saue the

and it semed by their <UNCLEAR>feire</UNCLEAR> semblant, that it greved hem but
litill or nought, but they comforted hem that weren synners, and
seide that oon sholde come, which sholde delyuer hem out of

</P><P>  So longe haue thei spoken of hym, that now is he comen,
and hath taken from vs tham, that non othir ne myght us

in a water in the name of the fader, sone, and holy goste, and
after that have we no powre vpon them, but yef they do turne

neuer so many of oure werkes, yef they will repent and for-sake
their myslyvinge, and do as they teche hem that ben for the

that they may not repente ne speke with hem that myght gete

wise sholde sithe oon telle alle thynges that were don and
saide <MILESTONE N="1b" UNIT="folio"/>bothe of that is passed and of thynges that is to come,
and be that sholde he be bileved of moche peple.  Than thei
ansuerde alle and seiden, that wele hadde he sped that soche a
man myght gete, for he sholde be beleved of all thinges that
he seide.  Than ansuerde a-nothir fende and seide, "I have
power for to sowe seede in woman, and make her conceyve, and
I have oon that doth all that euer I wille; and thus vndirtoke he
this enterprise to gete a man that sholde do their werkes after
their alle entente.  Ffull grete foles were thei whan they wende
that oure lorde sholde haue no knowynge of their ordenaunce,
and enquire thus they departed from this conseille and were
assented to this conclusion, and this feende that toke this
enterprise ne taried not, but in al the haste that he myght, he come
ther, as this woman was that wrought all his wille; and when
he com their he fonde here at his likynge, whiche yaf to hym
all her part of that she hadde, and here lord was right a ryiche
man.</P><P>  This riche man hadde grete plente of bestes and of othir
richesse, and also he had thre doughters and a sone by
this woman in whom the deuell hadde so grete power.  This
feende ne forgat not as he that not elles desired but hir to
disceyve and to shame; and he axed of hir, "How myght I,"
quod he, "gete thy lord on my part;" and she ansuerde that in
no maner wise lesse than he were wratthed; "and," quod she,
"thow maist sone make hym wrothe, for he is right hasty."
Than wente this deuell to this gode mannes bestes, and kylled
of hem grete plente; and when the heirdes sye their bestes so
deyen in the feldes, thei merveyled gretly, and tolde their
maister the mervelle of the moreyn, that was fallen a-monge the
bestes.  Whan the gode man herde this he gan to wratthe, and
merveyled gretly what was cause of the moreyn; and axed of
the heirdes.  Quod he, "Know ye ought what thise bestes eiled
thus for to dye?"  And they ansuerde "Nay;" and so it passed
forth all that tyme, and anon as the feende sye that the gode
man was wroth for so litill, he dought that yef he dide hym

gretter damage, that he<NOTE1 PLACE="foot" N="*" ID="note.1">The word "he" is inserted above the line.</NOTE1> wolde be moche wrother, and so myght
he haue hym the more atte his wille, and so he yede to x gode
horse whiche that the gode man hadde, and slowe hem alle in a
nyght.  And when the gode man sye his gode go to so gret
myschef, he gan to be angry, and seide a worde of grete ire, for
he yaf to the deuell all the remenant that was lefte.</P><P>  And whan the deuell knewe that <ADD>he</ADD> hadde youed hym soche
a yefte, he was right glad, and hasted hym to do hym
more damage, for he spared nothynge that he myght devoure;
and than was the gode man sorowfull and angry, and fled
company of peple for hevynesse, that he was moche soell by hym
self; and than wiste the deuell wele that he shulde haue his will
fro thens-forth.  Thanne come this feende to a feire sone that
he hadde, and hym straungeled in his bedde slepynge, so that on
the morowe he was founden dede.  Than this gode man ferde
as a man out of reson for hevinesse and sorowe that he hadde
loste so his sone, and fill in dispeire; and when the feende sye
this he was glad, for than he hadde all his desier with-oute
recouerer.  <MILESTONE N="2a" UNIT="folio"/>Than wente he to the woman that hadde made hym
all to wynne, and made her go up on a grete huch and tye a
corde a-boute a perche, and knyt it a-boute her nekke, and made
her distende fro the huch, so that she henge her-self and was
strangelid to deth, and when the gode man saugh that he hadde
loste bothe his sone and his wif in soche manere, he made gret
doell, so that he dyed for gret sorowe and hevynesse, and thus
doth the deuell to them that he may ouercome, and soche as he
fyndeth at his wille; and when he hadde thus don he was right
glad, and devised how he myght best disceyve the thre doughtres
of this riche man whiche were lefte, and he vndir-stode wele that
he myght nat disceyve them in no manere, but yef it were with
som mans werke, where-in thei sholde haue delyte.  And he
hadde a yonge man in the town, whiche was moche disposed after
his entent, and redy to inclyne to his werkes; and so he stered
this man, that he come to the oon of these sustres, and thourgh

the deueles entysement, that he lay by hire.  And than was the
feende wele pleseth, and than wolde he neuer cesse till he hadde
made it openly knowen, for to make hir vtterly shamed and
stroied; ffor that tyme it was the lawe yef a woman myght be
founde in fornication that she sholde, by Iustice of the lawe, be
put to deth, but yef that she wolde abandone hir body to alle
men as a comen woman.</P><P>  The man fledde a-wey, and the woman was taken and ledde
be-fore the Iuges, where-of they hadde grete pite for
loue of hir fader, whiche was right a worthy man, to whom weren
falle many myshappes with-in shorte tyme, for he was oon of the
wurshipfullest men of all the contre.  Not-withstandynge they
moste do hir the lawe, and so they acorded that she shulde be
dolven in the erthe by nyght by cause of her frendes.  In the
contre was ther a gode holy man, that herde speke of this
merveyle, and he com for to speke with the tow sustres that were
lefte, and he comeforted hem gretely, and axed of hem this
aventure was be-fallen of their fadir and modir, and of hir suster,
and hire brother; and they ansuerde that thei wiste not, safe only
"that god hateth vs, and suffreth vs to have this turmente."
Quod the gode man, "Ye sey amysse, for god hateth no creature,
but is euell pleseth, whan that synners haten hym by thaire
werkes; and, ther-fore, wyte ye well that this is the
encombraunce of the deuell, and wyte ye ought, what dede your suster
hadde don, that ye haue hir loste in this wise."  And they seide,
"Nay."  Than this holy man counselled hem to be wele ware,
and kepe hem fro euell dedes, for synne draweth bothe man and
woman to myshevouse ende.  And so he taught and enformed
hem here creaunce and feith.  The elther suster vndirstode hym
wele, and gretly was plesed with his doctryne, and the holy
man lerned her to love god and drede god; and she peyned hir
gretly to do as he hir taughte, and to contynue in gode
lyvinge.  And he seide to hir, "Yef ye truste that I sey vnto yow, grete
gode and comfort ye shall fynde ther-<UNCLEAR>fro</UNCLEAR>, and ye shull be my
doughter in god, and in what nede that euer ye haue I will not

helpe of our lord god; and dismaye yow not in no maner, but
trust verely in god, and often repeireth to me, for I duell not fer<MILESTONE N="2b" UNIT="folio"/>
hens."  Thus this holy man counselled these sustres, and set
hem in gode wey; the eldeste yaf gode credance to this holy man,
and loved wele his blissed techynge, and his gode tales that he
tolde hem euery day.  When the deuell sye this, he was euell
plesed ther-with, and hadde grete fere to lese his labour aboute
them, and he dought that he myght not wynne hem by felschip
of man, with-oute counseille of some woman; and he hadde oon in
the town that ofte hadde don his wille.  This woman the deuell
brought to these sustres, and she toke the yonger in counseill
and frayned her of many dyuerse thynges, and of the maner of
hir lyuynge.  Quod she, "How doth youre suster? loueth she
yow wele as she ought to do?"  Quod the mayden, "My suster
is so hevy and pensif of oure mys-happes that right seilden she
maketh eny mery chere to me, ne to noon other, and that maketh
an holy man that ofte speketh with hire, that she doth nothynge
but as he will."  "Ha!" quod she, "euell spende ye youre
tyme of that feire body that ye haue, that never shull haue ioye
while ye be in her company."  "Now, feire love," quod she,
"yef ye knewe what ioye other women haue ye sholde preyse
litill alle othir thynges; ffor we haue soche ioye when we be in
company of men that we loven, that yef we hadde but a mossell
brede, we haue more ioye and delyte than ye haue with alle the
delicatys of the worlde.  Fye! what ioye hath a woman
with-oute man?  Ffeire love, this I sey for yow that knowen not
what it is to be in mannes company, and I will telle you why:
youre suster is elder than ye, and so she wolde alwey holde yow
as her sogect, so that she myght have all, and so shold ye loose
youre tyme, and the ioye of youre feyre body."  And answerde,
"How shulde I be so hardy to do as ye telle me, ffor my suster
ther-fore was putte to deth."  Quod this othir, "Youre suster dede
like a fooll, and hadde but sympell counseill, but yef ye will do
after me, ye shall haue all the delyte of youre body with-oute
eny lettynge."  "I wote now," quod she, "ne I dar no more


<EPB/><PB N="7" ID="pb.7"/>

speke with you at this tyme, for my suster; but go youre wey,
and anothir tyme, we shall speke more at leyser."  And when
the Deuell herde this he was glad, and wiste wele he sholde haue
alle his will.  And when this woman was goon, the mayden
be-thought her often-tymes of that she hadde <CORR SIC="seyde seyde">seyde</CORR> vnto hire;
and when the deuell sye that she spak ofte sythes so to hir-self
a-lone, he put in hir mynde all that he myght, so that on
a nyght she be-heilde hir fayre body, and seyde to hir-self,
"Truly," quod she, "the gode woman that spake with me seyde
full trewe."</P><P>  Tho it happed on a day after that, she sente after this woman,
and she com.  "Truly," quod she, "ye seyde me soth
that my suster set but lytill prise of me."  And she ansuerde
that, "I wist it wele, and yef will she haue lesse, so she haue hir
owne delyte, and we be made for noon other cause, but for to
haue counfort and ioye of mannes felishep."  And the mayde
sede, "I wolde gladly, yef I sholde not be deed ther-fore."  And
the olde woman seyde to hir, "Yef ye do as folily, as your syster
dede, ye sholde be deed therfore, but I shall telle yow how ye
shull do."  Quod the mayden, "Telle on, and I will do after
techynge."  Quod this othir, "Ye shall abandon yow to alle men,
and sey ye will no longer a-byde with youre suster, and thus
shall ye haue all youre luste of youre body, ne neuer shul ye
here Iustice that will speke therof to let yow; <MILESTONE N="3a" UNIT="folio"/>and thus shall
ye be oute of all daunger, and euery worthy man will be glad to
haue you for youre grete herytage."  And the mayden graunted
to do in this manere, and thus she departed from hire suster, and
abandoned hire body to alle men, be the conseill of this olde
woman, where-of the devell was right gladde that he hadde
brought this a-bouten.</P><P>  And when the elder mayden sye that hir suster was thus gon,
she yede anoon to the holy man that hadde taught hir the
right creaunce, full hevy and pensif, makynge grete doell and sorow;
and when this godeman sye her so pensif he hadde grete pitee,


<EPB/><PB N="8" ID="pb.8"/>

and seyde to hir, "Blesse the and comaunde the to god, for I se
the gretly affraied."  And she ansuerde, "I have grete cause,
for I haue loste my suster, that is be-come a comyn woman."
And when the gode man herde this he was gretly astonyd, and
seide, "The feende is full besy a-bowte yow, which will not
cesse till he have disseyved the; but god be thyn helpe!"
"A sir," quod she, "how may I kepe me from his disceytis?
for ther is no thynge that I have so grete feire of, as that he
sholde have ouer me eny power."  Quod the holy man, "Yef
thow wilte do after my counsell, he shall never disceyve the."
"Certeyn," quod she, "I will gladly do your counsell."
"Than," quod he, "belevest thow not in the fadir, sone, and holy
goste, and that these thre persones be oon god in trynite, and
that god com down in to erthe, and be-com man for the
redempcion of mannes sowle, of hem that in hym stadfastly beleve, and
kepe his comaundemente."  And she seide, "Right as ye sey, I
beleve; and so, veryly, I pray to god be my socoure and helpe."
"Now than," quod he, "I pray the, and comaunde that thow
kepe the fro fallynge in to grete ire or wrath, for in that the
feende repaireth moste, bothe in man and woman, namly, when
they be in grete ire and comberaunce; that thow haste yelde the
in the graces of oure lorde and alle seyntis; and at alle tymes
thow goist to bedde, or arysist, blisse the in the name of the
fader, sone, and holy goste, and make upon the in the name of
the crosse, on the which he suffred his passion to bye vs fro the
peynes of helle.  And yef thow do thus, thow shalt have no
drede of the feendes power.  And where that thow slepest on
nyght, loke that thow have lyght, ffor the deuell hatyth all
clerenesse and lyght, and gladly will not com there."</P><P>  Thus taught the holy man the mayden, which hadde grete
drede of the deueles engynes; and so she returned hom
a-geyn to her house, full stabill in the feith, and full humble to god,
and to the pore peple which comen vnto hir, and seiden, "Trewly,
it is no wonder though ye be gretely affraied of the turment, that
is falle of youre fader, and of youre moder, and youre broder and
sustres, that thus be myscheved; but now taketh gode counsell,

<EPB/><PB N="9" ID="pb.9"/>

and be of gode comfort, for ye ar right ryche, and have grete
herytage; wherfore euery worthy man will be glad to have yow."
And she ansuerde a-geyn, and seide, "Oure lorde kepe me in his
servyse, as he knoweth it is grete nede."  Thus endured she
wele two yere, that the feende myght neuer be-gyle her, ne
neuer myght make her do euell werke; and he sye wele, that he
ne cowde nat make her lese that the holy man hadde hir lerned,
lesse than she were made wroth.  Than made he hir suster come
on a saterday, at even, to do hir more turment and anger, to loke
yef he might gete hir in that manere.  And when hir suster com,
it was fer with-ynne nyght; and she brought with her a grete
hepe of harlotys.  And when she sye her suster so come she was
angry, and seide vnto here, "Ffeire suster," quod she, "as longe
as ye caste yow to lede soche lyf, ye ought not to <MILESTONE N="3b" UNIT="folio"/>come in this
place, for ye make me haue grete blame, wherof I have lityll
nede."  And she ansuerde a-geyn, as a woman that the feende
was with-ynne, and seyde that she wolde yet do worse, and
seide that she was more euell than she, and bar hir on-honde
that she loved the holy man paramours, and yef it were knowen
the trouth that she worthy to be distroid.  And when her
suster herde this, she griped hir be the shulders, and put hir owt
at the dore; and the tother, to a-uenge hir, made the harlotys
that come with hir to kach her suster, and bete her right euell;
so with grete peyne she aschaped fro them, and fledde in to her
chamber, and shet her dore, and barred hit ffrom her, and the
harlottis that were come with her.  And she a-bode in her
chamber alone, and leyde her down on her bedde all clothed, and
wepte tendirly for sorowe; and when the deuell sye that she was
angry, and sole by her-self, and that it was derke, he was
gladde.  And she remembred the myschef of hir fader and moder, and
brother and susters, and sore wepte when she hadde thought on
all parteis; and so ther was grete sorowe and grete ire at hir
herte.  And when the feende sye that she hadde foryete that the
holy man hadde taught her, he thought that she stode owte of
goddes grace, and of her maister; "and now might I well put
oure man in hir."  And this feende, that hadde power to make


<EPB/><PB N="10" ID="pb.10"/>

woman conceyve, was all redy, and lay by hir, while she was
slepynge; and when she hadde concayved, she awaked, and in
her wakyng, she thought on the holy man, and ther-with she
blissed here, and seide, "Seynt Mary, what is me be-falle, ffor I
am disceyved sith I leyde me here.  Now, gracyouse lady, pray
vnto <UNCLEAR>thi dere</UNCLEAR> sone that <UNCLEAR>he haue</UNCLEAR> mercy upon me, and diffende
my body fro turment of the enmy."  And than she <UNCLEAR>aros, and
sought aboute</UNCLEAR> after hym that sholde haue don that dede, for she
wende to haue founde hym <UNCLEAR> thar-ynne, and she</UNCLEAR> ran to the dore,
and fonde it shet in the same maner as she had barred it her self,
and than she sought ouer all in her <UNCLEAR> chamber</UNCLEAR>, but nought cowde
she fynde.  Than she demed that it was the enmy that so hadde
her begiled, and than she made full grete sorowe, and cryde
moche vpon oure lorde, prayinge hym, that he wolde not suffer
her to be shamed here in this w<UNCLEAR>orlde</UNCLEAR>.  And anoon as it was day,
the feende led a-way this othir suster, for she hadde fully espleyted
his purpos.  And when they were alle passed, she com owte of
hir chamber sorowfull and pensif, and called after her seruaunt
and a-noon sente after two women; and when they were come,
anoon she wente to hir confessour.  And the gode man sye her
comynge, he seide, "Thowe hest som grete nede, for I se the
gretly affraied."  And she answerde, "I ought wele to be
affrayed, for it betyde to me that neuer fill to <UNCLEAR>eny</UNCLEAR> woman
saf oonly to me; and therfore I come to seche youre counseill,
for I haue herde yow saye, that ther was neuere creature that
dede so grete offence that yef he were confessed and repentant,
and that he wolde resceyve penance for his trespasse, that he
sholde <UNCLEAR>haue</UNCLEAR> anoon foryevenesse.  Sir, I have synned, and wete
ye wele I am disceyved be the deuell."  <UNCLEAR>Than</UNCLEAR> she tolde how
hire <UNCLEAR>suster</UNCLEAR> com to hir howse, and all, gynnynge and ende as ye
haue herde, and how she fill on slepe <UNCLEAR>on her</UNCLEAR> bedde, and hir dore
shette and barred, and how hir grete <UNCLEAR>sorowe made hir</UNCLEAR> for-yete
to blisse hir; and, quod she, "When I a-woke I fonde me
diffoulde, and my maidenhede loste.  Sir, I sought thourgh my


<EPB/><PB N="11" ID="pb.11"/>

chamber, and fonde my dor shet, ne I cowde fynde no lyvinge
creature, that eny suche thynge myght haue don to me; for in
<UNCLEAR>this</UNCLEAR> <MILESTONE N="4a" UNIT="folio"/>wyse I have synned, wherfore I crye god mercy, and yow,
and that I may have soche penance, that I lese not the lif
everlastynge."  The holy man lestned well to all hir confession, but
he yaf no grete credence to that she seide, for he herde neuer
be-fore of no soche thynge; and therfore he seyde unto hir, quod
he, "Thow art fulle of the deuell; how sholde I absoyle the, or
enioyne the penance for thynges which I wene thou lyest veryly,
for never was ther woman that loste her maiden-hede, but she
wiste by whom and how, or, at the leste, that she myght fele the
man that dide the dede; and thow woldiste make me bileve this

"Gode lete me haue delyueraunce yef euer man, my witynge,

"So veryly god make my soule safe, as I sawe hym neuer that

wherefore I doute the sore, lest thow me disceyve and be-gyle."  "Hit

which hadde ther-of so grete merveile that he wolde not

menetyme that they entended a-boute this mater, come Merlyn to
Blase, and seyde, "Thow moste have grete traueyle a-boute the

"How?"  Merlyn seyde, "I shall be sente after to seche oute

whos name was Constance.  This Constance regned a grete tyme,
and hadde thre sones, the first hight Moyne, and the other
Pendragon, and the thirde Vter.  This Constans hadde a man in his
realme that hight Vortiger; this Vortiger was a worldly wise
man, and Constance was a man of grete age, and ended his
lif.  Tho the pepill axed who sholde be her kynge and here lorde;
they acorded to make Moyne kynge, that was eldest, for it was not
right that noon other sholde be by-fore hym.  Heir-to accorded
Vortiger hym-self, and the barons chosen Vortiger to be
stwarde.  And the hethen peple that werreden on the kynge Moyne often
sithes foughten withe the crystene.  And Vortiger dide with all
the realme his wille, that the kynge that was yonge ne hadde but
the krowne.  So hadde Vortiger the hertys of the peple, and he
knewe well that thei heilde hym worthy and wise, and lyfte hym
to grete pride, for he sye ther was noon in the londe that myght
do so moche as he.  The hethen assembled a grete oste vpon
hem, and the kynge com to Vortiger, and seide, "Gode frende,
helpe to diffende the lande, for I and alle the peple be at thy
comaundement."  And Vortiger seyde, "Sir, ther is moche
peple in youre londe that me haten, therfore lete them helpe yow,
for I will not entermete me ther-of.</P><P>  When the kynge and thise other sye that ther was noon helpe
in hym, ne socour, they returned, and arayed hem, and
made hem redy to fyght, but they were disconfited of the hethen
peple; and than they returned, and complayned here grete losse,
and seyden yef Vortiger hadde be ther, they hadde not so
myshapped.  So be-gan the peple to hate the kynge.  Thus it indured
longe tyme, tyll that the kynge was holden a cowarde; and alle
the barons seiden thei wolde no longer suffer hym to be
kynge.  Than come they to Vortiger, and seide, "Sir, we ben kyngeles,
for he that we have is nought worth; for goddes sake take
it upon yow, and mayntene vs, for ther is noon in this londe
that may so well as ye."  And he ansuerde, "I may not, ne I
ought not to do while the kynge leveth."  "Truly," quod <MILESTONE N="8b" UNIT="folio"/>they,
"better it were for vs that he were ded that a-lyve."  "Yef he
were ded," quod Vortiger, "than yef ye and other wolde assent,

I wolde be youre kynge."  When thei herde these words,
supposed wele what he ment.  Thei toke leve of hym, and yede in
to their contreyes, and tolde their frendes the ansuere of Vortiger,
and thei seide, "It were beste for vs to sle hym, and than may
Vortiger knowe that he is kynge thourgh oure helpe, be that we
have slayn the kynge; and so shall he euer after do oure wille,
and be oure frende.  And so xij made hem redy, and wente in to
the halle ther the kynge was, and ran on hym with swerdes and
knyves, and slowe hym.  And thei fonde but ffewe that a-geyn
hem seide to make resistence.  Tho they com to Vortiger, and
seiden, "Now shalt thow be kynge, for we have slayn kynge
Moyne."  When Vortiger wiste he was ded, he made semblaunt
as he hadde be right wroth, and seide, "Full euell have ye
sped that thus have slayn youre kynge.  I rede you to fle out of
the londe for drede of the kynges peple, and me forthynketh that
ye be hider i-come."  And thei anoon departed thens, and thus was
kynge Moyn slayn.  After, the peple of the Contre assembleden,
and speken of Vortiger; and so thei acorded to haue Vortiger
kynge.  At this counseill were two noble men that kepten the
two childeren which were <CORR SIC="betheren">bretheren</CORR> to kynge Moyn, that was
Pendragon and Vter.</P><P>  When these tow gode men wisten that Vortiger sholde be
kynge, thei denied wele that thourgh hym was kynge
Moyn slayne, thei toke consell be-twene hem bothe, and seide,
"Sithe that Vortiger hath do sle oure kynge, lete vs now
kepe the two children, for we loued moche the fader, that to
vs did many benefetes, and be hym haue we yet all that
we haue.  Gretly were we to blame yef we loste that we
haue so longe kepte.  Than the two gode men acorded that
they wolde fle in to a straunge contre towarde Gawle, and
lede with hem the two children that they hadde so longe tyme
kepte.  But at this tyme I will not sey where thei be come
till tyme of the tale come ther-to; but thus moche I sey yow,

Bourges, were thei longe tyme norished.  And so may ye
vnderstande be this tale that he ought doth for a gode man,
lesith not his traueyle.</P><P>When Vortiger was chosen to be kynge, and he was sacred,
and lorde of londe, thei that hadde slayn the kynge
Moyne come be-fore hym.  And when he hem saugh, he made
semblaunt as he hadde neuer seye them be-fore.  And thei
reproved hym of vnkyndenesse, and seyde thourgh them he was
chosen to be kynge, for his love hadde thei slayn kynge
Moyn.  When Vortiger herde hem seye thei hadde slayn their lorde, he
comaunded to take them; and seide, "Ye have Iuged youre-self
that knowliche that ye have youre lorde slayn.  In the self
manere sholde ye do to me yef ye myght; but I shall make yow
well to be kepte."  And when thei vndirstode this, they were
sore abasshed, and seiden, "Sir, we trowed to deserue of yow
thanke."  Than Vortiger made hem to be bounde to horse tailes,
and made hem to be rente and drawen a-sonder, alle xij, while
eny hym wolde holde with other.  Thise that thus were
distrowed were come of grete lynage; they come to Vortiger, and
seide, "Thow hast don <MILESTONE N="9a" UNIT="folio"/>vs grete shame, that haste putte oure
frendes to so vileyns deth; we will never gladly do the servise."
When Vortiger herde their manasynge, he was wroth and angry,
and seide yef they spake eny more ther-of he sholde do the same
with hem.  And they hadde grete dispite of that worde, and
ansuerde as thei that litlll him douted.  "Thow manesest vs as
thow wilte, but while we have eny londe, or kyn, or frendes,
shalt thow neuer be with-oute werre; for thow art not oure lorde
be right, ne the londe is not thyn, but that thow haste a-geyn all
reson; and wite þou wele that thow shalt dye the same deth
that thow hast made hem."  And thus they departed with-oute
more at that tyme.  In this manere be-gan the euelwill be-twene
the kynge and the barons, so that thei assembled grete pepill
vpon the kynge, and did hym grete harme, and token often
prisoners, and many other prayes upon hym.  In this maner
hadde Vortiger werre longe tyme, and often tyme faught so with
them that he drof hem oute of hys londe.


<EPB/><PB N="27" ID="pb.27"/>
</P><P>  And when he hadde dryuen hem oeut, he be-come so crewell to
his peple that thei myght no lenger hym suffer, but a-roos
a-geyn hym, and refte hym grete part of his londe, and stuffed
their forteresses.  When Vortiger sye that, he was ferde to lese his
londe.  Than he sente Messages to the Danes that were hethen peple,
and seide he wolde have pees with hem.  When thei wiste that
Vortiger disered the pees, they were gladde.  Than com Angier
to Vortiger, and serued hym trewly till he hadde made ende of
his werre.  Than Angiers spake so with Vortiger, that he toke
oone of Angiers doughters to his wyf.  Wher-thourgh the peple
seyde he loste grete parte of beleve for his wif that was not
crysten.  After all this Vortiger knewe wele that he hadde not
the hertys of the peple; and also the sones of Constance were
fledde in to straunge londes, and that thei wolde repeire as sone
as thei myght; and knewe well also yef they come a-geyn it
sholde be to hym grete damage; and therfore he thought to
make a Castell so stronge and so large, that he sholde not drede
no werre.  Tho lete he sende after alle the masons and
werkemen of his londe, and comaunded hem to make a tour, the
strengest that myght be devised in eny maner, and than did to
brynge ston and morter, and be-gan the werke.  And when thei
hadde wrought a iiij fadome of height, than it ouerthrewe, and
the mountayne that the werke was sette on gan to tremble, that
thei semed it wolde synke.  And he seide for that wolde he not
yet cesse, but make it vp a-geyn.  Thus thei wrought dyuerse
tymes, and euer it fill and trymbled.  When Vortiger sye his
werke myght not holde, he seide he sholde neuer have ioye till
he myght knowe what was the cause that it fill.  Than he sente
after alle the wisest men of his londe.  And when thei were
come he tolde hem the merveyle of his toure, and axed theyre
counseile.  And thei seide ther myght noon knowe the cause
why, but it were notable clerkes; "ffor thei can knowe many
thinges be force of clergie that we ne can no skyle on."  Than
seide Vortiger, "Me thinke ye sey soth."  He lete sende after
alle the wise clerkes of his londe, and tolde hem how his toure
fill, wher-of they gretly merveiled.  Than he toke oon of the

<EPB/><PB N="28" ID="pb.28"/>

wisest of hem, and axed hym yef he trowed they cowde telle
why his werke myght not stonde.  <NOTE1 PLACE="foot" N="*" ID="note.4">Between the words <HI1 REND="i">stonde</HI1> and <HI1 REND="i">Do</HI1> are two marks, apparently to fill up the space of the line.</NOTE1>

"Do me to wete that ye can
telle the cause why?"  And when thei herden this, they seide,
"Sir, <MILESTONE N="9b" UNIT="folio"/>we witeth not; but ther be somme that myght wele knowe
by astronomye."  "Than," quod he, " enquereth a-monge you
who will take the labour to serche oute the cause why, and lete me
wite."  Than enquered oon of a-nother yef ther were eny that
cowde of that art.  So ther were two that seide thei cowde
i-nough as hem semed.  Thise tweyne chosen to hem of hir othir
felischep, that thei were vij in nombre.  And they were brought
be-fore the kynge, and he axed, "Shull ye tell me thencheson
that my werke may not stonde, yef it may well be knowen by
eny man?"  Quod they, "We shall knewe it."  And the
kynge seyde he wolde yeve them what they wolde
desire.  Thus departed the counsell of the clerkes; and the vij a-biden
stille, that gretely payned hem to knowe how that toure myght
holde.  Gretly stodied euery clerke be hym-self, but for all their
labour thei cowde not fynde but oon thynge, and that thynge ne
heilde of nought as to the toure; till that the kynge comaunded
hem to sey that they hadde take in charge.  "Sir," quod thei,
"that ye vs axen is a grete thynge.  We moste yet haue viij
dayes of respyte."  Quod the kynge, "I will well that ye have so
longe terme; and be well ware that than ye sey me the trowthe."
Than wente the clerkes to counsell, and seide oon to anothir,
"What seme ye of this thynge that the kynge vs demaundeth."
Quod oon of hem, "Will ye do well? lete eche man by
hym-self telle me what hym semeth in this mater."  Ther-to they
accorded; than thei drowgh a-syde eche be hym-self; but thei
seiden of the tour they ne knewe nought, saf they sye a grete
merveyle, for thei saugh a childe of vij yere age, that was born
withouten fader erthly; and thus seide eche of hem.  Than seide this
other, "Cometh ageyn to-morowe alle to-geder."</P><P>  On the morowe, when thei were alle come be-fore hym, he
seide,  "Ye have alle seide to me oon thynge.  Ye seyen alle
<EPB/><PB N="29" ID="pb.29"/>

that ye come nought se touchynge the tour, but ye syen a childe
of vij yere age, born with-oute erthely fader.  Ye seiden to me
no more, and ther is noon that ne seeth, that by that same childe
we shull alle be distroyed; and this have ye alle fro me
conseled.  Now," quod he, "yef ye will leve me, ye shal warant youre
owen lyves, and I will telle how we shull acorde alle to oon tale,
and seyn alle that this tour may not holde, but yef in the
foundacion be put the blode of this childe, and than the tour shall
stonde.  And thus lete eayche of vs sey by hym-self, so that the
kynge ne a-parceyve not; but let vs diffende the kynge, that he
se hym not quyk, but thei that shull go to seche hym brynge his
blode.  Thus may we kepe vs from him be whom we se that we
shull alle dye."  Thus ended their counseill; and come be-fore
the kynge, and seide that thei wolde not sey openly, but eche by
hym-self in counsell, "and so shull ye wite who seide beste
reson, and that the oon sholde not knowe the counsell of his
felowe."  And so the kynge examyned eche by hym-self.  When
the kynge and his <MILESTONE N="10a" UNIT="folio"/>counseill herde this merveile, thei seiden it
myght welbe yef they myght fynde a childe born that hadde no
fader, "ye have eche of yow tolde me oon tale."  "Sir," quod
thei, "yef it be not thus, doth with vs youre volente."  Than
seide the kynge that he wolde have hem well kepte till he knew
the trouthe.  And thei seide, "Sir, ne speketh nought with the
childe, but comaunde as soone as he is founden that he be slayn,
and that the bloode be brought to yow."  The kynge made hem
alle be shett in a stronge house, and made delyuere that hem
neded; and cleped certeyn gentilmen, and made hem to be
sworne to do truly his massage, and comaunded hem to seche after
a childe of the age of vij yere, whiche was born with-owte fader
erthely.  Of these gentilmen were xij; and also the kynge dide
hem to swere that whiche of hem sonneste myght fynde this
childe, a-noon with-oute tariynge he sholde it sle, and brynge
the blode of the chylde vn-to the kynge, and that thei sholde not
returne with-inne two yere, lesse than thei myght fynde the
seide childe.  Thus the kynge lete seche this childe.  The
messagers departeden two and two to-geder, and passed thourgh


<EPB/><PB N="30" ID="pb.30"/>

many londes and contres in to a tyme that iiij of hem sodeynly
metten to-geder.</P><P>  Thus thei reden in oon company, alle iiij, till on a day that
thei passeden thourgh a feelde be-side a town where-in
were grete plente of children, that ther-in were pleyinge.  And
Merlyn, that knewe well that these iiij com to inquere after hym,
drough hym towarde oon of the richest of the company, for that
he wiste hym moste fell and hasty.  He hente his staf, and  yaf
this childe a grete buffet.  And a-noon this othir be-gan to crye
and wape, and to myssey Merlyn, and reproved hym with a lowde
voyce, and cleped hym "mys-begeten wreache and faderles."
When these messagers herden this, thei com toward the childe
that was wepynge, and axed hym whiche was he that hadde
smyten hym.  And he hem ansuerde, "It is the sone of a
woman whiche never knewe who hym be-gat, ne never man
cowde telle of his fader.  And when Merlyn herde this, he com
a-geyn them laughinge, and seide, "I am he that ye seche, and
he that ye be sworn ye sholden sle, and brynge my blode to
kynge Vortiger."  And thei herden hym thus sey, thei were sore
a-merveyled, and axeden hym, "Who hath tolde the this?"
Quod he, "I wiste it er ye were sworn."  Quod thei, "Than
moste thow come with vs."  "Nay," quod he, "I doute that ye
will me sle."  And yet he knewe well that thei hadde ther-to no
talant, but he seide that for to prove hem better.  Quod Merlyn,
"Yef ye will graunte me that ye shull not do me disese, I will
go with yow, and also telle why the tour may not stonde."  And
when thei herde that, thei were more a-baissed than
be-fore.  "Truly," quod thei, "this childe is merveilouse, and grete pite
it were hym to sle."  And eche of hem seyde that hem were
better to be forsworn than to sle this childe.  Than said Merlyn,
"Ye shull come herberewe ther as is my moder, for I may not
go with yow with-oute takynge leve of here, and also of a gode
man which is in the same place."  Thei seide, "We will go where
that thow wilte."  <MILESTONE N="10b" UNIT="folio"/>Thus brought merlyn the messagers of the
kynge to his moder place, and when Merlyn come in to the house
he comaunded that thei sholde have gode chere.  When thei were


<EPB/><PB N="31" ID="pb.31"/>

alyght, he brought hem be-fore blase, and seide, "Se hem here
that I tolde sholde come to seche me to sle," and seide to them,
"I pray yow that ye sey the trouthe be-fore this gode man,
why that ye beth sente, and wite ye well yef ye gabbe
enythynge, I know it wele i-nough."  And thei ansuerde, "We
will no lesynge make."  Quod merlin to Blase, "Maister,
vnderstonde well what thei sey."  Quod the massanger, "We be with
kynge Vortiger, whiche hath be-gonne to make a stronge toure;
and when the werke of this tour is iij or iiij fadom of
height, it may not holde, but synketh in an hour all that
is wrought in iij monthis.  Wherefore the kynge is angry
and wroth, and he dide sende after clerkes to knowe the
cause that his werke may not holde."  "Ye," quod Merlin,
"but noon of the clerkes ne cowde se the cause that letted
the werke to holde; but thei sien how I was born, and how
that I myght hem distroie, and so thei dide acorde that I
sholde be slayn, and seide that the kynges werke sholde
stonde, yef he myght have the blode of the childe born
with-oute fader.  And when Vortiger herde this, he heilde this a
grete merveile, and trowed that that the clerkes seiden
trewe.  And the clerkes charged the kynge that in no manere he sholde
not se me a-lyve; but as sone as I were founde, that I sholde
with-oute respite be slain, and my blode to be brought to be
putte with the morter in the foundement of the tour, and by
that thei seiden it sholde holde.  Vortiger, by their techynge,
toke xij messagers, and made alle xij to swere that thei sholde me
sle, and bringe with hem my blode; and of these xij be heer iiij
whiche, when ye were met, passeden thourgh the feild where
childern were bourdinge, and I, that knewe ye come me for to
seche, smote oon of my felowes, for I wiste well he wolde sey of
me the werste that he knewe in his anger, and ther-fore I it
dide, that this gode man shulde fynde me trewe of that I hadde
seide."  "Now, maister," quod merlin to blase, "axe hem yef
it be so as I sey."  "Truly," seide blase, "it were grete pite
hym to sle, for yef he lyve he shalbe right wise."  "Certes,"
seide euereche of the messagers, "I hadde leuer be disherited

<EPB/><PB N="32" ID="pb.32"/>

than he hadde resceyved deth thourgh me, and he hym-slef seth
that he knoweth all thynge, wote yef ther-to we have talent

dore; and Blase seide to hym how thei badde hym axe
yef he wiste that thei hadden talent hym to sle.  And merlyn
lowgh, and seide, "I wote well now thei be nothynge in will
ther-to."  Quod thei, "Wilt thow go with vs;" and merlin
seide, "Ye, with gode will, yef ye will promyse me truly to
brynge me be-fore the kynge, and that ye ne suffer noon other to
do me harme ne disese, er I have with hym spoken."  And thei
hym graunted.  Than seide Blase, "I se well that thow wilt
now leve me: what wilt thow that I shall do of this werke that
I haue be-gonne?"  "That shall I telle the," quod merlin;
"thow woste well that oure lorde hath yove me so moche witte

of his purpos, and I moste go in to that contre <MILESTONE N="11a" UNIT="folio"/>ffro whiche

hym how he sholde do.  He yeleped hym maister, for that he
was maister to his moder.  When the gode man herde merlin
thus speke, he was glad, and seide, "What thow wilte comaunde
me I am redy to do it."</P><P>  Thus Merlyn made hym redy to go, and seide to the
messengers, I will go take leve of my moder.  Tho he brought
hem ther as was his moder, and seide, "Feire moder, heire ben
come men of fer contrees, for to seche me, and I will go by youre
leve; ffor me houeth to yelde the to Ihesu Criste, of that he hath
yove me power, and that I may not do; but I go thider as thei

moste we bothe departe fro yow at this tyme."  "Ffeire sone,"
quod she, "to god I comaunde yow, for I knowe not yef it were
wisdome to witholde yow, or noon; but yef it were youre plesier,
I wolde that Blase sholde a-bide."  "Dame," quod he, "it may
in no wise ben."</P><P>  Thus toke Merlyn leve of his moder and wente with the
massengers, and on the tother side Blase departed, and
yede in to <CORR SIC="Nothumberlond">Northumberlond</CORR>, ther Merlin had hym comaunded,
and the massagiers rode forth till thei come thourgh a town in
whiche was a market, and when thei were passed thourgh thei
ouertoke a carl, that hadde bought a payre of stronge shone, and
also stronge lether to clowte hem with.  And when merlyn sye
the carle he be-gan to laughe.  The messagiers axed hym
wherfore he lough.  "I laugh," quod he, "at this cherl that hath
bought hym so stronge shoone, and also clowte lether, and I telle
yow certeynly that he shalbe dead before he come fully to his
howse."  <MILESTONE N="11b" UNIT="folio"/>  And when thei herde thes, thei heilde it a grete
merveile, and seide thei wolde wyte yef that were trewe.  Than
two of them sewed hym, and other two abode with
Merlyn.  They hadde not folowed the cherl half a myle, that thei fonde
hym deed, in myddell of the wey, and his shone a-boute his
nekke.  Than thei returned, and ouer-toke hir felowes, and
tolde hem the merveyle that thei hadde seien.  "Fforsothe,"
quod thei, "grete foles were the clerkes that so wise a man wolde
have slayn."  "In feith," qou the oon, "I sholde suffer grete

myschef er he had eny harm."  And so thei seiden alle iiij,
that Merlyn ne herde it not.  And when thei were come to
merlyn, he thanked hem of that thei hadde seide, and that wolde
hym so moche gode.  And thei were gretly abasshed, and
seiden, "We may nought sey, ne do, but this childe knowe it."
Thus thei riden forth her iourneis, till thei come with-inne
Vortigers power.  And as thei passed thourgh a town, they
saugh a deed childe on a beere, born to chirche, to be
beried.  And after the corse was made grete doel and wepynge.  And
when Merlyn saugh the wepynge, and sye the preste and the
clerkes wente synginge be-fore, he gan to laugh, and seide to his
felowes, "I se a merveile."  And thei axed, "What?"  Quod
merlyn, "Ye se that gode man that maketh this grete sorowe."
And thei seide, "Ye."  "And se ye not the preeste that singeth
all be-fore."  Quod thei, "We se hym well."  "Forsothe," quod
Merlin, "he ought to make the sorowe that the tother gode man
maketh, for wethet it well that the childe is the prestes sone;
and the other man wepeth, and hath more cause to laugh."
Quod thei, "How may we knowe that it be so?"  "Goth to
the moder, and axe whi she doth wepe; and she will sey for her
sone, that is deed.  And ye shall sey, it is not hir sone, but the
Prestes sone, that so hye singeth; and than shall ye heere what
she will sey."</P><P>  The massagers wente to the woman, and toke her in
counseill, and seide as Merlyn hadde hem taught.  And when
the woman herde hem so sey, she was abaisshed, and seide,
"Seres, for godes love, mercy!  I se wele I may not to yow
lye, thowgh I wolde, for that ye sey is trewe; but I be-seche
yow telle it not my housbonde, for than he wolde me sle."  And
when thei hadde herde this merveile, they turned, and ouertoke
her felishep, and seiden as thei herde.  And than thei reden
forth till they come a iourney fro thens ther Vortiger was.  Than
seide two of the messagers to Merlin, "We shall go be-fore to
the kynge, and telle hym þat we have founden; now yeve us
counseile how thow wilte we shall sey, for I trowe he will blame
us that we have not the slayn."  "Sirs," quod Merlyn, "sey as

I shall telle yow, and ye shalbe well excused.  Ye shull go to
Vortiger, and sey that ye have me founden, and sey I shall telle
hym truly the cause whi his tour may not stonde; with this
condicion: that the Clerkes haue the same Iuyse that thei hadde
ordeyned for me.  And also sey him, I can telle hym why the
clerkes wolde haue me deed.  And when ye have seide thus, doth
hardely that he yow comaundeth."  With that the messagers
departed, and come to Vortiger.  And when he sye them, he was
gladde, and axed a-noon how they hadde spedde.  <MILESTONE N="12a" UNIT="folio"/>"Sir," seide
thei, "in the beste wise <CORR SIC="that that">that</CORR> we may."  Than they cleped
the kynge in counseile, and tolde how thei hadde founde Merlyn;
and also they seide, yef he hym-self ne wolde, they sholde hym
neuer have founden.  "Of whiche Merlyn," seide the kynge,
"speke ye? sholde ye not haue sought the fadirles childe, and
have brought me the blode of hym."  "Sir," thei seide, "that
same is Merlyn, that we of speke to yow.  And wetith it wele
that he is the wisest man, and the beste devynour that is, saf

will vndertake it,"  quod thei.  "Than, go fecche hym," quod
the kynge.</P><P>  The messagers yede their wey, and the kynge rode after
hem.  When Merlin saugh the messagers, he seide to them, "Ye
have plegged me vpon youre lyves that I shall have no drede of

with the kynge, and a-noon merlin hym salued, and seide, "Sir
kynge, lete me speke with yow in counseile."  Than the kynge
drough a-part, and called hem that he hadde brought with
hym.  "Sir," quod merlyn, "thow haste do seche me for thi toure that

to do to hem the same that thei wolde do to me, I will telle the
cause whi it falleth, and also I shall teche the how thow shalt
make it to stonde and endure."  And Vortiger ansuerde, "Yef
thow do as thou seiest I will do with hem as thow wilte."
"Than," quod Merlin, "go we thider as this toure is in makynge,
and make the Clerkes be brought theder, and I shall axe hem
whi the toure doth falle, and so mayste thow hiere ther

whi that that toure fill, and thei ansuerde, "We knowe
no cause whi it fill, but we can telle what shall make it for to
holde."  And then seide the kynge, "Ye tolde me a merveillouse
thynge, that I sholde do seche a childe born with-outen fader,
and I wote not how he myght be founden."  Than spake Merlyn
and seide to the clerkes, "Sirs, ye holde the kynge a fole, that
thus make hym seche a man that is born with-outen fader, and
ye no do it nothynge for his profite; but ye dide it for this, that
ye fonde in youre sorte that ye shulde be deed thourgh hym, and
for <MILESTONE N="12b" UNIT="folio"/>drede ther-of haue ye do the kynge to vnderstonde that I
sholde be slayn, and my blode be putte in the foundement of
the toure, and that sholde make it to laste and holde; thus ye
thought to sle hym, be the whiche ye sholde be brought to the

<EPB/><PB N="37" ID="pb.37"/>

that thei supposid no creature hadde knowen, thei weren a-basshed,
and wiste wele that thei sholde dye.  Than Merlin seide to the
kynge, "Now may ye knowe whi these clerkes wolde have me
slayn: nought for to holde youre toure, but for theire sorte seyde
thei sholde dye for me.  Now axe hem yef this be true, for thei
sholde not be so hardy be-fore me to make yow no lesynge."
"Seith he trewe?" quod the kynge.  "Sir," said the clerkes,
"ye, truly; but we merveile wherby he myght this
knowe.  Wherfore we be-seke yow to graunte vs to live, that we may see
that he shewe the trowth whi the toure fallith, and yef he can
telle the remedye."  "Certes," quod Merlyn, "have ye no drede
to dye be-fore ye se the cause that the toure doth falle, and that
the werke may not laste?"  "Sir kynge," quod Merlin,
"vnderstonde, and I shall telle the.  Vnder this erthe is a grete water,
and vnder that water be two dragons that see no sight; so is that
oon reade and that other white, and a-bove them is two grete
flat stones, and when thei fele that the werke peyseth hevy upon
them, they turne hem, and the water maketh so grete bruyt that
all that is made a-boven it moste nede falle.  Now lete loke yef
this be trewe or no; and yef it be founde that this be cause
that the werke stondeth not, lete my plegges be quyte, and the
clerkes in blame, that of all this ne knewe nothinge."  "Certes,"
quod Vortiger, "yef this be as thow seist, than art thow the
wisest man of the worlde.  Now telle me how this erthe may be
hadde a-wey."  And Merlin seide, "In cartes and on mennes
nekkes."  A-noon the kynge made come laboreres, and Merlin
comaunded that the clerkes sholde be wele kepte, and so wrought
the laboreres, that thei hadde a-wey the erthe, and fonde the
water, and dede it to laden oute, and lete the kynge wite how
thei hadden don.  The kynge come thider gladly, and brought
with hym merlin.  When he com thider, he beheilde the water
that was grete, and cleped two of his counsellers, and seide,
"This childe is right wise that knewe this to ben heere, and yet
seith that ther ben two dragons vnder, and I will knowe the
soth, what-so-euer it coste."  Than the kynge cleped Merlyn,
and seide, "How shall we haue this water a-wey?"  Quod

<EPB/><PB N="38" ID="pb.38"/>

Merlyn, "Lete make goteres in to the diches."  Than were the
diches made, and the water to renne oute.  And Merlyn come to
Vortiger, and seide, "As soone as these dragons felen to-geder thei
will fighten strongely, and that oon shall sle that other; therfore
send after alle the gode men of thi londe to se the bataile, for it
hath grete singnification."  Than sente Vortiger after alle the
worthy men of his londe, Clergie and other; and when thei were
alle comen, Vortiger tolde hem the merveiles that Merlin hadde
shewde, and of the two dragons how thei shulde fight.  Than
seide oon to a-nother, "It is gode to be seen;" and they axed the
kynge yef he knewe whiche sholde haue the better; and the
kynge seide he hadde not yet tolde.  Whan the water was all
voided thei saugh the two stones <MILESTONE N="13a" UNIT="folio"/>that were vpon the two
dragons.  The kynge axed how thei myght be hadde a-wey, and
Merlyn seide, "Full wele, for they will neuer meve till eche of
hem fele other, and than shull thei fight till that oon muste dye."
The kynge axed, "Whiche shall have the victorie?"  "In the
fightynge," quod Merlyn, "is grete signifiance, whiche I may
not telle, but gladly I will tele the be-fore three worthi men."
Than Vortiger cleped thre men that he moste truste inne, and
Merlyn axed, "Be these thre men wele of thi counseile?" and
he ansuewerde, "Ye."  "Than may I telle be-fore them that
thou demandest.  I do the to wete," quod he, "that the white
shall sle the reade; but first shall he have grete peyne, and in
that he shall sle hym is grete tokenynge to hym that can it
vnderstonde; but I will sey no more till the bataile is at an
ende."  Than yede the peple to oon of the stones, and leften it
up, and founde the white dragon.  When the peple saugh hym
so grete and hidouse thei hadde grete drede.  Than wente thei
to the tother ston, and drough it a-wey, and than thei were
more aferde than be-fore, for it was moche greter and semed
more feirce.  And as Vortiger semed he moste ouercome that
other.  And Merlin seide to the kynge, "Now lete my plegges
be quyte."  "So be thei," seide the kynge.  Tho spronge vp
the two dragons and foughten to-geder with teeth and feet, and
neuer herde ye of so stronge bataile be-twene two bestes, ne so


<EPB/><PB N="39" ID="pb.39"/>

crewell fight.  And so thei foughten to mydday, and the peple
semed that the reade sholde ouercome the white, till that the
white threwe so moche fiere and flame that he brente vp the
reade, and so was he deed.  Than the white leide hym down to
reste for werynesse, and ne lived after but thre dayes.  And
thei that this syen seyde that neuer so grete merveile hadde be
seyn be-forn.  And Merlin seide to the kynge, "Now mayste
thow make thi toure as grete and large as thow wilte, for it
shall no more falle."  Than comaunded Vortiger the werkemen
to make vp the toure the strongest that myght be devised; and
often axed Vortiger of Merlyn the significance of the two
dragons.  And he seid, "It was the tokenynge of thinges that were don
and also of thinges that were to come, and yef thow wilte ensure
me that thow shalt do me noon harme heere in audience of this
peple, ne suffer noon other to do me harme in thy reame, I will
telle the significacion."  And Vortiger made hym soche suerte
as he wolde.  Quod Merlin, "Bringe hethir thy counsell, and
the clerkes that sorted of this toure."  The kynge dide as he
comaunded.  When thei were come Merlyn spake to the clerkes,
and seide, "Ye were foles in youre art, that wolde not a-quite
yow as trewe men, and therfore ye be worthi to haue as ye
haue deserved.  And ye sawgh wele how I was bore.  And he
that shewed yow that, made yow semblance that ye sholde be
deed for me, and that dide he for sorowe that he hadde loste me,
and therfore he wolde that ye hadde me putte to deth; but I
haue soche a goode lorde, that he shall me deffende yef it be
his plesier, and I shall make hym a lyer, for ye shull neuer
for me be deed, yef ye will me graunte to do that I shall
yow sey."  And when they herde hym sey that thei sholbe
respited fro deth thei were gladde, and seiden, "What that
thow comaundest we shall do it, for we se well that thow
arte the wisest man that liveth."  Quod Merlin, "Ye shull
swere neuer to entermete of that arte, <MILESTONE N="13b" UNIT="folio"/>and I will that ye be
confessed and take youre penaunce so that youre soules be not
dampned."  And thei hym thankeden, and seide thei sholde
do his comaundement.


<EPB/><PB N="40" ID="pb.40"/>
</P><P>  Thus delyuered Merlin the Clerkes, whiche made hym to be
sought for to be putte to deth.  Vortiger com to hym, and
seide, "Telle me the significaunce of the two dragons."  "The
reade dragon," quod Merlin, "be-tokeneth the, and the white
dragon signifieth the sones of Constance."  When Vortiger
herde this, he was a-shamed.  And merlin seide, "Yef thow
wilte, I will sey more; with that thow conne me no
magre."  Vortiger seide, "Here ne is no man, but of my prive counsell; and
therfore I will thow telle me alle the trouthe."  "I tolde the,"
quod Merlin, "that the reade signifieth the, and I shall telle the
how the children of Constance were yonge and tender, after the
deth of their fader; and yef thow were soche as thow oughteste
to have ben, thow sholdeste have kepte hem, and yeven hem
counseile a-geins alle erthly men.  And well thow knowest that
thow haste theire heritage wrongfully; for when thow knewest
the peple loved the, thow drowest the a-bakke, for to helpe them
in their nedes.  And when eny of the londe complayneth to the
for the kynges Innocence, and seiden thei wolden thow sholde
take vpon the to be kynge, to defende the reame fro their
enmyes, thow ansueredest couertly, and seidest thow myghtest
not while kynge Moyne was livinge.  And thei that thow seidest
this to, vndirstoden wele that thow woldest haue hym deed; and
and ther-fore thei slowen their kynge.  But thei leften two
brethern, the whiche fledde in to straunge londe, for drede of
the.  And so were thow made kynge; and yet thow holdest
their heritage with wronge.  And when thei had kylde the
kynge Moyne, thei come be-fore the; thow madest hem to be
distrowied, to shewe semblaunce as thow hadde for-thought the
kynges deth."  Vortiger vndirstode wele that Merlyn hym tolde,
and wiste wele that he tolde hym the trouth; and seide, "I se well
that thow art oon of the wisest men of the worlde.  Wherfore,
I pray the to yeve me counseill in this cas, and also telle me on
what deth I shall dye."  Quod he, "Yef I telle the that I wilnot
sey the betokenyng of the two dragons.  I do the to wite that
the reade Dragon signifieth the, in that he was so grete and
hidouse, be-tokeneth the, and thy grete power.  And the white

dragon be-tokeneth the two childeren that be fledde for drede of
the.  And that thei foughten so longe to-geder, be-tokeneth that
thow haste so longe kepte their herytage with wronge.  And
that the white dragon brente the redde dragon, betokeneth that
the two brethern shull brenne the with theire power.  And
therfore I ne trowe not that this toure shalbe thy warante, but that
thow shalt dye by hem."  When Vortiger vndirstode this, he gan
to wrathe, and axed hym, "Where ben these children?"  Quod
Merlyn, "Thei be in the see, with grete strengthe of peple; and
come into heir londe, to take vengaunce on the; ffor thei seyn
thow dedist their brother to be slain.  And wite it wele that

"Nay."  And when Vortiger knewe that the children come
with so grete power, he somowned his peple a-geyn the tierme
that Merlyn hadde seide.  Vortiger com to Wynchester <MILESTONE N="14a" UNIT="folio"/>with
all his oste, but no man ne wiste the cause whi, saf thei that
weren of his counseile.  And as soone as Merlin hadde seid the
kynge, alle the tokenynges of the two dragons, he toke leve,
and wente to Blase, and tolde hym alle thynges like as were

thei that kepte the porte axed to whom longed that vessell; and
they ansuerde it was the vessell of Pendragon and Vter, whiche
were come in to their owne londe, to take vengaunce on Vortiger,

and of a grym chere, and they axed hym of whens he was, and he
ansuerde, "Of Northumberlonde, a seruaunt of a worthi man;
but yesterday," quod he, "I saugh a man that tolde me that the
kynge Pendragon come for to seche Merlin in this
contre."  Quod that other, "It is soth that the kynge doth hym
seken.  Canst thow ought telle where he is?"  And the cherl ansuerde
and seide, "Yef I saugh the kynge, I wolde sey to hym that I
wolde not telle the."  "Than com with me," quod he, "and I
will shewe the kynge."  Than seide the cherl, "I sholde kepe
my bestes; but yef he come heder I will telle hym gode tydinges
of that he goth sechinge."  Than he departed and come to the
kynge, and seide as he herde the cherl say; and the kynge badde
"Bringe me ther."  Than he ledde the kynge to the same place,
and seide to the cherl, "Lo, her is the kynge; now sey to hym
what thow wilt."  Quod he to the kynge, "Thow goist sechinge
Merlyn, but thow shalt not fynde hym till he will

sone come to the when he wote thow doiste a-bide hym."  "How
may I knowe that?" seide the kynge.  Than the kynge <MILESTONE N="15a" UNIT="folio"/><CORR SIC="than the kynge"></CORR>rode
to the nexte town that he fonde in the forest, and thider come
to hym a comely man wele araied, and seide to the kynge, "Sir,
Merlin sente me hider to the, and sente the worde that it was
he, that thow mette with-inne the wode kepynge bestes.  Be
this token that he seide he will come to the when thow haste of

sente the gode tidinges.  Wite thow wele that Aungier is ded,
for thy brother Vter hath hath hym slayn."  And tho the kynge
hadde grete merveile, and seide, "May this be true that thow

mystruste hym thou art a foole."</P><P>  Than the kynge made two messagers to ryde in all haste, to
wite yef it were true.  And thei rode forth till thei
metten the messagers of Vter, that come to telle the kynge of
Aungers deth.  And when thei weren mette, thei returned
a-geyn to the kynge, and tolde how Vter hadde slain
Aungier.  And the kynge comaunded hem to kepe counseile, for he
merveyled gretly how merlin myght have witinge ther-of, and
thought in his herte that he wolde axe hym how Aungier was
deed.  And as the kynge come fro chirche on a day, ther mette
hym a comly man, well araied, and clenly, that seide to hym,
"Sir kynge, what a-bideste thow in this town?"  Quod the
kynge, "I a-bide after Merlin, that sholde come heder to speke
with me."  "Sir," quod he, "though ye mete hym, ye can not
knowe hym; but clepe to yow soche men as ought for to knowe
hym, and axe them yef I may be Merlin."  And they come
be-fore hym, and he hem frayned what was here
a-bidinge.  Quod they, "We a-byde the gode devynour."  "Sirs," seide the
kynge, "yef ye myght se Merlin, cowde ye hym knowen?"
"Sire," seide thei, "it myght not be but that we sholde hym
kenne wele, yef we myght him se."  "Sirs," quod he that
was be-fore the kynge, "may eny man knowe a-nother when he
knowith not hym-self."  And thei seiden, "We may not wele
knowe all his werkinge, but yef we myghten sen his semblaunce,
we sholden knowe hym wele."  And than ansuerde the man, and
seide, "Ther is no man that can at alle tymes knowe his
semblaunce."  And than he toke the kynge in counseile, and seide,
"Sir, I will be with yow, and with youre brother.  And I do yow
to wete that I am he that ye have sought.  Now, go ye oute, and
clepe hem that sey thei knowen Merlin; and as sone as they come,
thei shull sey ye haue me founden."  Than was the kynge right
gladde, and in all haste cleped hem that cowden knowe
Merlin.  And Merlin toke the semblaunce that thei hadde sein hym
be-fore.  And a-noon thei seiden, "Lo, here is Merlin."  Quod the kynge,
"Be well a-vised that ye knowe it is he."  And thei seide, "We

knowe verely it is he."  Than seide the kynge, "I wolde fayn
knowe yef euer I spake with yow be-fore, sith I come in to this
contre."  "Sir,"  quod Merlyn, "I am the man that ye fonde
kepinge the bestes, and also I am the man that tolde yow
that Aungier was deed."  Than seyde the kynge, "Sirs, ye
knewe Merlin full euell."  And thei seide, "Sir, we sye hym <MILESTONE N="15b" UNIT="folio"/>neuer do thus be-forn."  And than the kynge axed of Merlyn,
"How knewe ye the deth of Aungiers."  Quod Merlyn, "A-noon
as ye were departed fro youre oste, to come hider, Aungiers wolde
haue morderid thi brother in his teinte.  And I wente to thi
brother, and warned hym of Aungiers purpos, and of his strengthe,
and how he wolde come be nyght hym-self to his teynte, formeste
of his company.  And thi brother dide not mystruste me, but
made good waicche all that nyght, sole be hym-self, till that
Aungiers com with a knyf in his honde, to sle thi brother.  And
Vter lete hym entre in to his teynte, and serched a-boute; but
he fonde not Vter ther-in, wherfore he was sory.  And at the
comynge owte, thi broþer faught with hym, and slowe hym his
owne handes."  Than the kynge axed hym in what semblaunce
he hadde spoken with his brother.  "Sir," quod he, "I was like
a sadde olde man."  Quod the kynge, "Tolde ye hym what ye
were?"  And Merlyn seide, "Nay; ne he ne shall not wite till
ye telle hym youre self."  Than seide the kynge, "I pray yow
right, deere frende, that ye will come with me, for I have grete
nede of youre counseile."  "Sir," quod Merlin, "the sonner I
come ther, the wrother shull be youre meyne."  Quod the kynge,
"Thow hast seyde so moche, that thow hast saued my brother fro
the deth, that I shall neuer the mystruste."  Quod Merlyn,
"I shall speke with thi brother in the same forme that I warned
hym of his deth, and shalbe with-inne this xj dayes."  And the
kynge seide, "And it plese yow, lete me wite when ye shull
speke with hym."  "Ye shull wite it well," quod Merlin, "but,
loke ye, discure it not to noon creature, as ye will haue my love."</P><P>  Thus was Pendragon and Merlin first a-queynted.  And
Merlin toke his leve, and wente to Blase, his maister, and
tolde hym alle thinges.  And he wrote hem in his boke.  Pendragon


<EPB/><PB N="47" ID="pb.47"/>

 taried not till he come to his brother Vter.  Wher-of
Vter was ioyfull, and toke the kynge in counseile, and tolde hym
of the deth of Aungiers, in the same wise as Merlin hadde
tolde.  Quod the kynge, "I pray yow telle me what man that was that
warned yow of Aungiers."  "Be the feith that I owe to yow,"
quod Vter, "I can not sei what he is, but wele he semed a wise
man, and therfore I yaf to his counseile credence."  "Brother,"
quod Pendragon, "kowde ye ought knowe hym, and ye myght se
hym agein?"  "Sir," seide Vter, "ye, right wele."  And
Pendragon seide, "I do yow to wete he will speke with yow
withinne these xj dayes; but I pray yow that ye be euer in my
presence, that I may se alle tho that come to speke with yow,
that I may wite whether I may knowe hym sonner than ye."
And Vter ther-to graunted.  And Merlin tolde all this to Blase:
how the two brethern hadde spoke to-geder, and how thei were
acorded of hym, and how Pendragon wolde assaie hym in all the
maner that he myght.  Than Blase axed what he dought to
do.  And Merlyn seide, "Thei be yonge men and Iolye, and have
grete nede of counseile, and I knowe a faire lady that Vter
paramours.  And I will go, and bringe hym a letter, as it were from
her, for I knowe alle the prevy wordes that have ben be-twene <MILESTONE N="16a" UNIT="folio"/>hem two.  The xj<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> day come Merlin to courte, like a boy that
hadde ben a messager from Vters love, and seyde, "My lady
sente me to yow, and sendeth yow gretinge, and sente yow this
letter."  And Vter toke it with grete ioye, for he wende his
lady hadde sent hym that letter, and seide he sholde yeve
credence to the bringer ther-of, and of all that he sholde sey.  And
Merlin tolde hym many tidinges, soche as he wiste wele that he
wolde gladly listen.  Thus a-bode Merlin with hym, till it was ny
even; and grete merveile hadde Pendragon that Merlin com not
as he hadde made promyse, till that merlin drow hym a-syde, and
toke the same semblaunce that he spake with Vter the firste
tyme that he warned hym of his deth.  And a-noon, as Vter
hym saugh, he knewe hym wele, and praide hym that he wolde
tarie a-while, till he hadde spoke with the kynge, his
brother.  And Vter tolde Pendragon how the gode man was come that


<EPB/><PB N="48" ID="pb.48"/>

warned hym of the treson of Aungiers.  And than come the
bothe to-geder to that man.  And whan the kynge sye hym, he
made grete ioye, and seide he was welcome.  And than the
kynge seide, "Will ye that I telle my brother who ye ben, and
what youre name is?"  And Merlin ansuerde, "I will wele that
he knowe what I am."  Than seide the kynge, "Feire brother,
ye knowe not who this worthi man is.  I will that ye wete he is
the wisest man that leveth, and moste may vs profite and
helpe.  And I do yow to wite that ther come noon other boy in message
be-fore yow this day, saf this worthy man.  And he hym-self
toke yow the letter fro youre souereine lady."  When Vter herde
this, he was astoned sore, and seyde to hym-self, "How myght I
this knowe, or be-leve, for it were the most merveile of the
worlde."  Quod he, "Wite it wele ye may it als truly be-leve as
eny thinge that ye beste knowe."  "In feith," quod Vter, "I
may not leve it, but I myght it other-wise prove."  Than the
kynge prayde Merlyn that he wolde shewe some maner
demonstraunce."  "Than," quod Merlyn, "go ye a litell oute, and
shall shewe the same boy that brought the letter."  And thei
yede oute of the chamber, and Merlin toke a-gein the semblaunce
of a boy, and come to Vter, and seide, "Sir, I will go; is ther
eny thinge that ye will comaunde me?"  And than seide the
kynge, "Brother, be thow right sure that this is the same man
that warned you of Aungys treson; and I lete yow wite that he
hath power to knowe alle thinges that beth do or spoken, and of
thinges that be to come grete partie.  Wherfore I wolde hertely
pray hym to be with vs of oure counseile; and by hym shall we
be rulid of alle oure gouernaunce, for, trnly, brother, we have
grete nede therto, and it were his plesier."  Than bothe the
brethern be-sought hym full lowly to a-bide with hem, and thei to
be gouerned by hym as he wolde.  And than Merlyn seide, "I lete
yow wite that I knowe alle thinges, that me leste to wite."  Quod
Vter, "Haue to me seide so moche, that neuer shall I mys-trowe
the fro hens all my live.  And for youre grete wisdome, and it
like yow, I wolde ye were lorde and gouernour of my brother and
me."  And Merlin ansuerde, "I will be with yow many tymes,

<EPB/><PB N="49" ID="pb.49"/>

and I will also that ye tweyn prively in counseile knowe my
condicions and my behavynge; but I moste be ofte tymes in the forestes,
the chief of grete Bretaigne.  And knoweth wele, in what place that
euer I be, in the moste remembraunce that I shall haue, shall be
vpon yow, and on yowre nedes, more than eny others.  And in
what maner nede that ye <MILESTONE N="16b" UNIT="folio"/><CORR SIC="that ye"></CORR>have in eny encombraunce, I will
euer redily come to yow, and helpe yow, and counseile.  And
therfore recched neuer when I go or come; and at alle tymes,
when I come, make grete gladnesse of me be-fore youre peple, in
youre howsolde."  In this maner was Merlin witholden with
Pendragon and his brother Vter.  And he toke his leve of hem, and
seide he wolde shewe hym in the same semblaunce that the peple
of the contre were wonte to knowe hym inne.  And when he
come a-monge them, thei that knewe hym made grete ioye, and
runne to telle the kynge that Merlin was comen.  And a-noon the
kynge wente a-geins hym; and grete was the ioye that the kynge
mad of Merlin.  And when he was ther-inne, thei that hadde
knowinge of hym toke the kynge in counseile, and seide, "Sir, lo,
heir is Merlin, whiche is the wysest man that is in all the worlde,
saf god al only.  Therfore, pray hym to teche you how ye shull
do in getynge of this castell, and how that this werre shall ende."
The kynge seyde he wolde gladly of hym enquere, as thei
desired.  And so at that thei sesid, for the kynge wolde hym
wurship and honoure in all that he myght.  And on the thirde
day the kynge made alle his counseile a-semble, and than the
kynge demaunded Merlin of that his barons hadden desired to
knowe, and seide, "Dere frende, I have herde moche spek of
yow, that ye be oon the wisest man that is in the
worlde.  Wherfore, I pray and requere yow in this wise, that I shall euer be at
youre wille, that ye will lete wite how I myght haue this castell."
And Merlin ansuerde, and seide, "I do yow to wite as sone as
the sarazins have loste Aungys, thei desire nought ellis but
forsake the londe.  And to-morow sende to hem to wite what thei
will do; and thei will desire the londe that thei were wonte to


<EPB/><PB N="50" ID="pb.50"/>

holde of youre fader; but ye ne shull not agre ther-to, but when
ye knewe their ansuere, ye shall offer them to condite oute of the
londe, and shippes to their passage."  Than sente the kynge,
Vlfyn and thre other knyghtes, and Merlin yaf hem the message.</P><P>  These messagers wente towarde the castell, and when the
sarazins sye hem comynge thei yede hem a-geins, and
freyned yef thei were come in message fro the kynge; and
Vlfyn seide, "Ye."  Quod Vlfin, "The kynge sente yow trewis
for thre wokes."  And thei ansuerde, "We will take
counseile."  Than thei yede to-geder a-parte, and seiden, "We beth
gretly hyndred be the deth of Aungys, and we haue heere no
vitaile to abide after socour of oure frendes, and heere is profered
vs trewis to passe, and with-oute vitaile we may not longe
endure; but lete vs sende to hym to suffer vs to haue the castell
and the londe that longeth ther-to for to be holden of hym and
of his heyres, and that we have xxx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> knyghtes on horse to yeve
hym to trewage, a C stedes, a C palfrayes, and a hundred
faucons."  And to this thei acorded alle, and come to the
messagers and tole as thei were acorded, and thei returned and tolde
the kynge their ansuere, and the kynge axed Merlyn his advise,
and Merlin seide, "This shall ye not do, for therof sholde come
grete harmes; but I shall telle yow how ye shall do.  Sende to
hem a-noon with oute tariynge that thei yelde yow the castell,
and thei shall do it gladly, <MILESTONE N="17a" UNIT="folio"/>ffor thei have no vitaile; and profer
hem to go saf with their lyves, and I do yow to wite they had
neuer gretter gladnesse."  And as Merlin devised, the kynge
dide, and sente his message with this requeste.  When thei of
the Castell herde thei myght go saf with thier lyves, thei hadde
grete ioye, and that was cried thourgh the londe.  And the
kynge lete condite hem to the portes, and deliuered hem the
navie in to passe.  Thus were alle put oute of the londe, be
counseile of Merlyn, and so was Merlyn all gouernoure of the kynge
and his counseile longe tyme; till on a day that he spake with
the kynge of a great matire, wherof oon of the barons hadde grete
envye, and come to the kynge, and seide, "Sir, it is a grete
merveile that ye have so grete bileve to this man, for wite it verily,


<EPB/><PB N="51" ID="pb.51"/>

all that he can cometh by the devell.  And yef it plese yow, I
shall a-say hym, so that ye shall se it aptly."  Quod the kynge,
"I will well that ye assay hym in soche maner that he ne be not
wroth."  "Sir," quod he, "I shall not do nothinge that sholde
cause hym to be angry."  And the kynge hym graunted.  This
baron was right wise, and full of euell vyces.  And on a day he
come to court, and made Merlin grete chere, and called hym
be-fore the kynge in counseile, and wele xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> knyghtes.  And
than he seide to kinge, "Sir, here is Merlin, which is þe
wisest man of the worlde, and he tolde Vortiger of his deth, and
how ye sholde do hym be brent.  I pray yow for that ye knowe
wele that I have grete sekenesse, that he will telle yow what
deth I shall deye, yef he knowe it."</P><P>  Than ansuerde Merlin, that wele knewe his fell herte, and
seide, "Sire, ye have me praide to telle of youre deth,
and I shall sey the soth; ffor that day thow shalt dye, thow
shalt falle of an horse, and breke thy nekke."  And seide he to
the kynge, "Sir, ye have herde how he hath seide; and god
defende me ther-fro."  Than he wente hom to his contre as
soone as he myght, and after com to courte a-gein to the kynge,
and made hym right seke; and sente to the kynge in counseill,
that he sholde come se hym, and that he sholde bringe with hym
Merlin in soche wise that Merlin sholde not knowe the cause
why.  And the kynge assented.  And the kynge come to Merlin, and
seide, "There is a seke man, lete vs go se how it is with hym."
And Merlin seide, "Sir, a kynge ought not to go so prevely, but
to <CORR SIC="haue haue">haue</CORR> his meyne a-boute hym."  And the kynge cleped
soche as he wolde, and wente to the seke man.  And when thei
come ther, he seide to the kynge, "Sir, I pray yow that ye will
axe youre devynour yef I shall dye on this sekeness."  And
Merlin seide, "He shall not dye on this maladye."  Tho enforced
he to speke, and seide, "Sir, on what deth than shall I dye?"
And Merlin ansuerde, and seide, "Thow shalt be hanged, and so
shalt thow dye hanginge."  And than made Merlin semblaunce


<EPB/><PB N="52" ID="pb.52"/>

as he hadde be wroth.  And when he wiste that Merlin was gon,
he seide to the kynge, "Sir, now wite ye verily that he is but a
fole, that hath tolde these two dethes, whiche may not be
acordinge; and yet I shall assay hym the thirde tyme.  I will
tomorowe go to an Abbey, and feyne me stronge sike, and I shall
sende to yow that a monke of his is so sike that he is in doute of
his lif, and pray yow to brynge with yow Merlin."  And the
kynge it graunted.  And than wente this baron to an abbey, and
dide all in like wyse <MILESTONE N="17b" UNIT="folio"/>as he hadde devised to the kynge.  And
than he sente for the kynge, and he come, and brought Merlyn;
and so thei come ridynge to the abbey, and herde messe.  After
masse, come the Abbot, be-sechynge the kynge to come se a
Monke whiche was sore seke, and that it plesed hym to bringe
with hym the wise man Merlin.  And the kynge axed of Merlin
yef he wolde go thider with hym.  And Merlyn seide, "Ye;
but first I will speke with yow and with Vter."  And than he
toke hem a-part, and seide,</P><P>  "Sirs, the more that I am with yow a-queynted, the more
foles I fynde yow.  Wene ye that I knowe not what
deth this fole shall on dye; and ye shull haue now more
merveile than of all that I haue seide be-forn."  And the kynge
ansuerde, "May this be true that he shall dye in soche wise?"
"Yef it be not so," quod Merlin, "leve me neuer of nothynge
that I shall sey; and thus moche I sey to Vter: that I shall se
his deth, er he departe his companye."  Than thei wente thider,
as the abbot hem ledde; and the abbot seide to the kynge, "Sir,
plese it yow to axe of youre devynour, yef this seke shall euer be
hoill of this sekenesse."  And Merlin made semblaunt as he hadde
ben wroth, and seide, "He myght wele a-rise, for hym eyleth
noon evell.  And lete hym knowe verily that day he shall on dye
he shall breke his nekke, and be hanged, and also be
drowned.  And ther-fore lete hym no more feyne, for I knowe wele his
corage, and that his false herte thynketh."  And he a-ros vp
sittynge, and seide to the kynge, "Sir, now may ye wele knowe
his folye; how myght this be, that the day I shall on dye, I
sholde breke my nekke, and be hanged, and also to be drowned;


<EPB/><PB N="53" ID="pb.53"/>

ffor I knowe wele that may not be, nother of me, ne of noon
other.  Now loke yef ye be a wise man to yeve so grete credence
to soche a man."  And thus thei departed, and all aboute it was
knowen how Merlin hadde thus seide of this mannes deth.  After
it fill on a day, that this man that thus sholde dye, rode with
moche peple, and come to a river, wher ouer was a bregge of
of tymber.  And his palfrey stombled on his knees, and he
ouerthrew, and brakke hys neke, and he rolled don of the bregge in
to the water, that a sharp planke of the brigge caught thourgh
his garment, so that his legges and his reynes hengen above the
water.  And many of them that were in his company were there
as Merlin tolde of his deth.  The cry was grete that thei made
to drawe hym oute of the water; and than thei seide, "A grete
fole he is that will not leve that Merlyn seith."  Thei diden
with the body as was right; and merlyn, that all this knewe
wele, seide to the kynge and Vter how it was be-tid of this
man.  And the kynge axed when this myght be, and he seide,
"Yesterday; and they that were with hym that tyme sholde come
withinne these vj dayes to bringe the tidynges.  And therfore I will
go, for I will not be here when thei come, for thei will demaunde
me of many questions, wherof I will not ansuere, ne I ne will speke
but litill be-fore the peple, but so derkly that they shul not
vndirstonde what I sey."  Thus seide Merlyn to the kynge and to Vter;
wher-fore the kynge thought he hadde be wroth, and was
therfore full sory and hevy.  And so wente Merlyn to his maister Blase,
and tolde hym of alle thynges, and many other that were be-falle.</P><P>  <MILESTONE N="18a" UNIT="folio"/>On the vj<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> day come thei to the kynge that hadde sein the
deth of this baron; and when they were come they
tolde the kynge the merveile.  And than seide the kynge, and
alle that herden ther-of, that ther was no-where so wise a man
as Merlyn, and seiden fro thens-forth all that they myght
hier hym speke or sey they wolde lete it be wreten.  And so
be-gan the boke of prophesies of Merlin, that spake of the
kynges that sholde be in Engelonde, and of alle other thinges
that he spake of, and he knewe that alle his wordes sholde
be wreten.  He tolde to Blase, and Blase axed Merlin yef thei


<EPB/><PB N="54" ID="pb.54"/>

sholde make soche a-nother boke as he dide.  And he seide,
"Nay; for they shull write not elles but soche thinges as no
man shall vndirstonde till it be fallen and passed."  And than
come Merlyn a-geyn to courte, and thei hym tolde the tydinges
as he hadde not knowe ther-of.</P><P>  Than be-gan Merlin to speke so mystily, wher-of the boke
of prophesyes is made.  And after come Merlin to the
kynge and to Vter his brother, and seide to hem pitously, "I love
moche yow and youre wurship; haue ye no mynde of the sarazins
that ye drive oute of the londe after the deth of Aungis?"  And
thei seide, "Yesse, full wele; but why sey ye?"  Quod Merlin,
"I sey for this: that they sey thei shull neuer fenisshe till thei
have a-vengid the deth of Aungis.  And thei have assembled a
grete power, and wele to conquere this londe be force."  When
the kinge and his brother herde this, thei merveiled gretly, and
axed of Merlin, "Haue thei so grete power to holde party a-geyn
oures?"  And he ansuerde a-geyn, "Euery man that ye haue
defensable, they have tweyne; therfore, but ye be wisly ruled,
ye shull be distroied, and lese youre reame."  Quod the kynge,
"We wilbe ruled be youre counseile."  And than he axed,
"When trowe ye that they shull come?"  And Merlin seide,
"The xj day of Iuyne; and noon ne shall this knowe, saf ye
two; and I deffende yow to speke ther-of, but do as I shall yow
counseile.  Sende after alle youre peple, and make hem the
grettest ioye and feste that ye may, and comaunde hem to be the
laste day of Iuyn, on the playn of Salisburye."  Than seide the
kynge, "Shall we suffer hem to aryve with-oute deffence?"  And
Merlyn seide, "Ye; yef ye will do my counseile, and suffer hem
to come as fer as ye may fro theire a-rivage; and so shall ye
kepe hem two dayes, and thei shull haue grete dissese for lakke
of water.  And the thirde day ye shull with hem fighten; and
yef ye do thus, ye shull haue the victorye."  Than seide the
two brethern, "I pray yow telle vs yef eny of us shall dye in
that bataile."  And Merlin ansuerde, "Ther is no-thynge that
hath be-gynnynge, but it moste have endynge, ne no man ought
to be dismayed of deth, to resceyve it as he oweth to do; and

<EPB/><PB N="55" ID="pb.55"/>

therfore I will that ye bringe the hiest reliques that ye haue,
and ye shull bothe swere to do as I shall sey yow, for yowre
profite and youre worship, and than shall I boldely telle yow
how ye shulbe gouerned."  And thei swore as Merlin dide
devise.  And when thei were sworn, Merlin seide vnto hem,
"Ye haue sworne that in this bataile ye shull be gode men and
true, a-gein god and youre-self.  Ne noon may be trewe to
hymself but he first be trewe to god; and, loke ye, be trewly
confessed, for that ye shull fight a-geyn yowre enmyes; and <MILESTONE N="18b" UNIT="folio"/>after
haue no doute to ouercome theym, for thei have no bileve in the
trinite.  And wite ye wele that seth cristendom come first in to
this Ile, was neuer so grete bataile, ne neuer shall in youre
tyme.  And also knoweth wele that the oon of yow two moste nede
passe in this bataile; therfore eche man ordeyne for his moste
worship that he can, a-geins that he cometh be-fore his
lorde.  And that oon of yow most go to hym; and therfore goth in soche
wise that ye may haue his love when ye come to his presence."</P><P>  Thus ended the counseile of Merlyn.  And the two <CORR SIC="bethern">brethern</CORR>
vnderstode what he hadde seyde, and sente after alle the
estates of theire londe.  And when thei weren alle come, thei yaf
hem grete yeftes.  And the kynge hem praide to make hem
garnysshed of their armes, and of horse; and also the laste woke
of Iuyn to be redy, in the entre of the playnes of Salisbury,
vpon the river of Tamyse, to diffende the reame.  And thus it
lefte till the day that was somowned.  And the two brethern
a-geyn their burghes and townes made gode ordenaunce, as
Merlin dide hem counseile.  And at Pentecoste thei heilde courte
vpon the rivere, and there were many riche yestes.  Ther thei
were so longe, till thei herden that the Danoyse weren
a-rived.  Than the kynge sente to prelates of the chirche, that euery man
of the oste sholde be confessed, and euery man to foryeven other,
and be in charite and clene lyf.  Than seide Pendragon to
merlin that tydinges were come; the Sarazins weren
a-rived.  And Merlin seide it was trewe.  Than the kynge axed what was
his counseile to do.  And Merlin seide, "Ye shall to-morowe
sende thedir that oon half of youre peple; and when they be


<EPB/><PB N="56" ID="pb.56"/>

come from their a-rivage, than go be-twene hem and the aryvage;
and youre peple shulde holde hem so shorte, that there ne shal
be noon of hem, but thei wolde fayn be ther as thei come
fro.  And thus shull ye do two dayes, and the thirde day, whan ye se
a dragon all reade fleynge vp in the ayre, than boldly fight with
hem, for ye shall haue the vyctorye."</P><P>  At this counseile were no mo but Pendragon and Vter.  And
when thei hadde herde this thei were gladde.  And than
seide Merlin, "I will go; and be ye right sure of this that I haue
yow seide, and thenke to be gode men and gode knyghtes."  Thus
thei departed, and Vter made redy his felishep to go be-twene
hem and the ryver.  And Merlyn come to hym, and seide,
"Thenke to do wele, and haue no drede, for thow shalt not dye
in this bataile."  When Vter herde þis he was gladde in
herte.  Than Merlin wente to his maister Blase in Northumbirlonde, and
<CORR SIC="tolde tolde">tolde</CORR> hym many thinges that he wrote in his boke.  Vter and
his peple rode till thei come be-twene the Danes and theire
shippes, and kepte hem two dayes, that thei myght neuer
ryde.  The thirde day the kynge come so nygh that thet oon myght se
that other.  Whan the sarazins saugh the two hostes, thei were
gretly dismayed, and sye wele that thei myght not repaire to their
shippes with-oute grete bataile.  Than shewde the signe in the
ayre that Merlin hadde seide, and than the Danes hadden grete
drede.  And the kynge seide to his peple, "Now vpon hem in
all that we may."  And whan Vter saugh the kynges bataile,
and the Danes assembled, <MILESTONE N="19a" UNIT="folio"/>he sette vpon hem as vigorously or
more.  In that bataile was grete mortalite on bothe parties, but
the hethen peple hadde moche the werse.  And ther Pendragon
dide merveloise knyghthode a-monge his enmyes, and so dide
Vter; but I may not telle alle they well dedis.  But Pendragon
was ther deed, and many a-nother gode baron, wher-of was grete
pite and losse to the cristen partye.  And as the boke witnessith,
Vter venquysshed the bataille, and ther ne ascaped noon of the
sarazins but that thei weren deed or taken.  And thus ended the


<EPB/><PB N="57" ID="pb.57"/>

bataile of Salisbury, wher-as Pendragon was deed.  And so all
the londe left hoill to Vter his brother.  He made geder alle the
cristen that weren deed, and made hem to be beried in a place bi
them-self, and a-reised his brothers tombe moche hier than eny
of the tother, and lete write vpon eche beryinge place his name
that lay vnder; but on his brother wolde he nought write, for he
seide who that them be-heilde myght wele vndirstonde that he
was chief lorde.  Than Vter went to logres, and alle the prelates
of the cherche, and ther was he sacred and crowned.  And thus
was Vter kynge of the londe after the deth of his brother
Pendragon.  And the quynsynne after that Merlyn come to courte,
and grete was the ioye the kynge made to hym.  And than seide
Merlyn to Vter, "I will that thow haue surnonn of thi brother
name; and for love of the dragon that appered in the ayre, make
a dragon of goolde of the same semblaunce."  And the kynge
dide do make this dragon in all the haste he myght, like to the
dragon that sewde in the ayre.  Than he lete sette it on a shafte
in stede of a baner, and lete it be born be-fore hym in euery
bataile at alle tymes when he sholde fight.  And thus was euer
after he cleped Vterpendragon.  And Merlyn a-bode with hym
longe tyme after, till on a day that Merlyn hym axed, "Ne shall
thow do no more to the place in the playn of Salesbury, wher-as
thy brother is buried?"  And the kynge ansuerde, "What wilt
thow that I do, for I will do euen as thow wilte devise?"  Quod
Merlin, "I will that thow ordeyne ther soche a þinge as shall
endure to the <CORR SIC="worles">worldes</CORR> ende."  And the kynge seide, "Telle me
in what wise, and I will do it with gode will."  Than quod
Merlin, "Sende after the grete stones that ben in Irlonde, and
make hem to be brought in thy shippes, and I shall go to shewe
them which I will haue that thei shull brynge."  Than
Vterpendragon sente vesselles grete plente, and Merlin hem shewde the
stones that were grete and longe, and seide, "Lo, these ben the
stones whiche ye ben come fore."  And when they hem saugh,
they it helde for a grete merveile, and seide it was a thynge
unpossible to charge, they were of soche gretnesse and wight; and
in their vessellis they seiden sholde they not come, yef god

<EPB/><PB N="58" ID="pb.58"/>

wolde.  And so thei returned to the kynge, and tolde the
merveile, and the kynge than seide, "Suffer till Merlyn come."</P><P>  And when Merlyn was come, the kynge hym tolde like as his
men hadden seide, and Merlin seide, "Sith it is so that
they may not hem hider bringe, I shall a-quyte me of my
promyse."  And than Merlin made by crafte of his arte to bringe
the stones that weren in Irlonde to the playn of
Salesbury.  And the kynge and moche peple wente to se the merveile; <MILESTONE N="19b" UNIT="folio"/>and
when thei saugh the grete stones, thei seden that all the worlde
ne myght not hem remeve.  And Merlin badde they sholde be
dressed vp-right, for thei sholde seme feyrer so than
liggynge.  And the kynge seide that myght no man do, saf only god.  Than
seide Merlyn, "Let me worthen ther-with, and I shall a-quyte
me of the <CORR SIC="comenaunt">couenaunt</CORR> that I made."  And so all the labour lefte to
Merlyn; and he dressed as thei be yet ouer the beryinge place of
Pendragon, and ben yet cleped the stonehenges.  And than come
Merlin to Vterpendragon, and hym serued longe tyme and moche
hym loved.  And so on a tyme he toke the kynge in counseile,
and seide, "Sir, I moste discure to yow the hiest counseile that
ye herde euer, and that thinge that I shall of speke shall be
right straunge; and I requyre yow that ye it not discure to no
man lyvynge."  And the kynge graunted his requeste.  Than
seide Merlin, "I will that ye wite that the knowinge that I
haue cometh be the enmy by nature; and oure lorde that is
almyghty a-bove alle thynge hath a-bove, that yove me witte and
memorye to knowe grete partye of thynges that be to come, and
by this souereyn vertu the enmye hath me lorn that with the
plesaunce of god they shull neuer haue power over me at her
volunte.  And sir, now ye knowe fro whens I haue this
power.  And I will telle yow a thinge that god will that thow shalt
do.  And whan ye knowe what it is, loke ye, performe it to his
plesier.  Sir, ye ought well to knowe that god come in to erthe to saue
man-kynde, and also, as ye well knowe, he made a soper, and
seide to hys apposteles, `Oon of yow shall me be-trayen.'  Sir,


<EPB/><PB N="59" ID="pb.59"/>

many provertees and grete suffraites suffred oure lorde her in
erthe for oure sake, and many shames that the Iues hym diden;
and after that he suffred bitter deth for vs upon the crosse; and
a knyght axed his body when he was deed vpon the seide crosse,
and it was graunted hym of Pilate in lower of his servyse."</P><P>  "Sir, it fill after that, this knyght whiche hadde taken oure
lorde down of the crosse, that he was in a waste
contree full of diserte, and moche of his lynage.  And, sir, vpon
hem fill a grete famyne and hunger, and thei complayned to the
knyght that was thier maister.  And he prayde oure lorde to
shewe his mercy to hem, and to shewe some demonstraunce, that
they myght be conforted of their grete disese.  And oure lorde
hym comaunded to make a table, in the name of that table at the
whiche he was sette in the house of Symond leprouse, and bad hym
take the vessell whiche that he hadde, and sette it vpon the
table, and couer the table with white cloth, and also the vessell,
all saue the parte toward hym.  Sir, this vessell was brought to
this seide knyght, by oure lorde Jhesu criste, whyle he was in

vessell were departed the company of gode and euell.  And also
at this table was euer a voyde place, that betokeneth the place of
Iudas, ther as he satte at the soper, whiche he lefte whan herde
that oure lorde seide that worde for hym, whan he seyde that he
that ete with hym sholde hym be-trayen.  Thus lefte Iudas the
place voyde till that oure lorde set ther a-nother, that hight
Matheu.  This Matheu was sette in that place to fille vp the
nombre of xij apostles.  <MILESTONE N="20a" UNIT="folio"/>Sir, this place that was voyde at the
table of Ioseph be-tokeneth the place that Matheu fulfilde; and,
sir, thus be these two tables convenable.  And thus hath oure
lorde filled the werke of man.  And, sir, the peple that were
ther-at cleped this vessell that thei hadden in so grete grace, the
Graal; and yef ye do my counseile, ye shall stablisshe the thirde
table in the name of the trinite.  And I be-hote yow, yef ye do
this, ther-by shall come to yow grete honour and grete profite of
youre soule; and also it shalbe a thynge that moste shall be
spoken of thourgh the worlde."  Thus seide Merlyn to Vterpendragon,


<EPB/><PB N="60" ID="pb.60"/>

wher-of he was well plesed, and seide to Merlin, "I will
that oure lordes wille be performed in all that is in me, in all
thinge that be to his wille; and all I putte in youre ordenaunce."
And than was Merlyn gladde, and seide, "Sir, loke where ye
plese beste that it be sette."  "Certes," quod the kynge, "where
as thow wilte, and ther as thow trowest it be moste oure lordes
wille."  And Merlyn seide, "It shall be at Cardoll, in Walys,
and make ther thy feest at Pentecoste.  And array the to make
gode chere, and to yeve grete yeftes; and I shall go be-fore, and
make the table, and whan thow arte come, I shall setten them

</HEAD><P>  All as Merlyn devised dide the kynge, and warned thourgh all
his reame to be at Cardoell, in Walys, at the
Pentecoste.  And thus he lete crye thourgh all his reame, and Merlyn dide
ordeyne all that longed to the table.  The weke afore witsontyde
come the kynge to Cardoell, and when he was come he axed
Merlin how he hadde spedde, and he seide, "Wele."  Quod the
kynge, "What men shull ye chese to sitte at this table?"  And
Merlyn seide, "Ye shull se to-morou that ye wende neuer to
seen, that I shall chese fyfty of the beste knyghtes of this
londe.  And whan thei be ones sette, thei will haue no grete desire to
returne in to their contrees.  And thus ye may knowe whiche
were gode men and worthy, whan ye se the signifiaunce of the
voyde place."  Thus Merlyn, on the witsonday, chese fifty
knyghtes, and comaunded hem to be sette at that table to mete;
and thei so diden with gode chere.  And Merlyn that full of
stronge arte, was yede hem aboute, and cleped the kynge as they
weren sette, and shewed hym the voyde place.  And many othir it
syen, but they ne knewe not the tokenynge, ne why it was voyde.

<EPB/><PB N="61" ID="pb.61"/>
</P><P>  When Merlyn hadde don all thus, he badde the kynge that
he sholde go sitte; and thus they diden alle viij
dayes.  And the kynge yaf grete yeftes to lordes, and to ladyes, and to
dameseles.  And when they departed, the kynge come to the
fyfty knyghtes, and axed how hem lyked.  And thei seyde,
"Sir, we haue no talent to remeve fro hens, and ther-of we haue
merveile what it maketh, for we be entred as <CORR SIC="bethern">brethern</CORR>; and
therfore we will neuer departe till deth vs departe."  When the
kynge herde hem thus sey, he hadde grete merveile, and
comaunded hem to be serued, and kepte as his owne
body.  And thus departed the grete prese.  And than the kynge come
to Merlyn, and seide, "Truly thow seidest me soth that oure
lorde wolde that this table sholde be stablisshed; but I wolde
praye the to telle me <MILESTONE N="20b" UNIT="folio"/>yef thow knowe who shall fulfille the
place that is voyde."  And Merlyn ansuerde, "Wite thow right
wele that it shall not be in thy tyme; ne he that shall
a-complesshen, it is not yet be-geten.  But it shall be in the kynges
tyme that shall come next after the; ne he that shall hym
engendere shall not knowe that he shall hym engendere; and he that
shall a-complysshe that sete must also complysshe the voyde
place at the table that Ioseph made.  And I pray yow therfore,
that euer hens-forth that ye hoilde alle youre grete festes in this
town."  "Certes," quod the kynge, "I will gladly."  And than
seide Merlyn, "Sir, I moste go, and of longe tyme ye shull not
se me a-geyn."  And the kynge hym axed whider he sholde go;
quod he, "Shall ye not be here at alle tymes when I holde my
grete courte?"  And Merlyn seyde, "No."</P><P>  Than departed the kynge, and Merlyn yede to Blase, and
tolde hym the stablisshement of this table, and many
other thynges.  And thus a-bode Merlyn thre yere that he come
not to courte.  They that loved not Merlyn, but by semblaunce,
come to the kynge on a day as he was at Cardoell, and axeden
hym of this voide place, and why there was not sette some
worthy man, that the table myght be full.  And the kynge
seide, "Merlin tolde me a grete merveile, that seide noon myght it
a-complisshe in my tyme, ne yet ne ys he born, that shall

engendre hym that shall it complesshen."  And thei lough ther-at,
as they that weren full of envye, and seide, "Sir, trowe ye that
ther shalbe better peple after youre tyme than beth now, and
that ther ne be now, as gode men in youre londe as thei shull be."
"Truly," seide the kynge, "I wote neuer."  And thei seide,
"Ye do not wele but ye assaye."  "Certes," quod the kynge,
"I will it not assaie, for I doute that Merlin wolde be wroth."
And than they ansuerde, "Yef ye wele yeve vs leve, we will
assaye it, and for to preve the grete lesynge."  And the kynge
seide, "Ne were the drede I haue of the wrath of Merlyn, ther
is nothynge that I desire so moche to assayen."  And they seide,
"Yef Merlyn be livynge, and he knowe that we will it assayen,
he will come with-oute faile, er eny man shall it assayen; but
suffre that we may it assaien at Pentecoste."  And the kynge
hem graunted, wher-fore they weren gladde.  Thus it lefte till at
witsontyde, that the kynge hadde do warne alle his barons to be
at his feste at Cardoell.  And Merlyn, that all thys wiste wele,
tolde vn-to Blase the euell thoughtes that they hadden, that
hadde take this enprise, and seide he wolde not go till he knewe
who sholde assaye to preve that place, for he hadde leuer haue it
preve by a shrewe than a gode man.  Thus suffred Merlyn to the
quynsyne of Pentecoste.</P><P>  Vterpendragon the kynge come to Cardoel, and brought with
hym grete plente of peple.  And thei that were come
for to assaie the place made it to be seide that Merlyn was deed,
and that he was founden in a wildernesse madde, and cherles
hym kylde.  And so moche peple spake ther-of, that the kynge
hym-self it leved; and more for that, he was so longe a-wey,
than for eny thinge elles, and, namely, he wende in no wyse he
wolde not have suffred that eny man sholde haue assaide the
voyde place yef he were lyvynge.  <MILESTONE N="21a" UNIT="folio"/>Thus was the kynge on
witson-even at Cardoel, and axed of hem that sholde it assaie,
whiche of hem sholde it do.  And he that all this hadde
ordeyned, seide, "Sir, I will that ye wete ther shall noon
assaie it but I."  Than he com to the table where as the
fifty knyghtes weren sette, and seide, "I am come to sitte


<EPB/><PB N="63" ID="pb.63"/>

with yow, and for to holde yow company."  And they ansuerde
no worde, but full mekely be-helde what he wolde do.  And the
kynge and grete partye of the barons weren ther
assembled.  This sette hym down in the voyde place, and a-noon as he was
sette, he sanke down as it hadde be leed, so that noon wiste
where he was be-come.  Than the kynge comaunded alle the
other gode men to aryse, and they so diden.  And than a-noon
be-gan so grete a noyse and sorowfull crye, that all the court
was trowbled; and the kynge hym-self was gretely
a-baisshed.  Thus they a-biden to the quynsyne after Pentecoste, that Merlin
come to courte.  And whan the kynge wiste of hys comynge, he
was right ioyfull, and wente hym a-geins to mete with
hym.  And a-noon, whan Merlyn saugh the kynge, he seide he had euell
spedde, to suffre eny man to sytte in that place.  "Trewly,"
seide the kynge, "I was disceyved thourgh here wordes."  "In
feith," seide Merlyn, "it falleth often to hem that wolden
begile, that thei be-giled hem-self; and that maist thow wele
proven be this."  After the kynge axed, "Yef he wiste where he
was be-comen that set hym in the sege?"  And Merlin ansuerde,
"Therof no force is for to enquere, ne nought it sholde a-vayle
for to wite, but thenke on them that in þe other places sitten,
and to mayntene that thow haste be-gonne; and alle thy festes
and alle thy courtes, come holde hem heir in this town, for to
wurship this table, for thow knowest by the assay that thow
haste seyen that it is of grete dignite.  And now I go; now, loke
thow do as thow haste seyde."  And thus departed the kynge;
and Merlin comaunded the kynge to beilde feire howsynge, where
he sholde euer after holde his courte and his hye festes.  Than
the kynge lete it be knowen thourgh his reame that all high
festes, as Pasch and Pentecoste, and yole and halowmesse, sholde
be holden at Cardoel; and a-geyn the feste of yole, he somowned
alle his barons, in soche maner that euerich of hem shulde brynge
with hem their wyves and doughtres, and her neces or
susteres.  And the knyghtes so diden alle.  I may not telle yow of alle tho
that ther weren, sef of hem that the tale reherses, oon after
a-nother.  Ther was the Duke of Tintagel, and Ygrine his wif;

<EPB/><PB N="64" ID="pb.64"/>

and hir the kynge loved gretly, but ther-of he made no
semblaunce, saf that often he be-heilde her more than a-nother;
in-so-moche that hir-self it perceyved, and knewe that the kynge
be-helde her often.  And whan she it perceyved, she eschewed to
come in his presence, for she was right a gode lady, and full of
grete bewte, and right trewe a-geins hir lorde.  And the kynge
for her love, and for he sigh she hadde taken hede of his lokynges,
he sente Iuwelles to euery lady that was at the feste.  And to
Ygerne he sente as he trowed sholde beste hir plese, and she
knewe and sigh wele that he hadde sente to alle other ladies, and
ther-fore she durste not refuse hirs, but receyved hem, and
thought wele in her herte, that the kynge ne hadde not yeven to
other ladyes, but for she sholde not refusen hirs.</P><P>  <MILESTONE N="21b" UNIT="folio"/>Thus hilde the kynge that feeste, that yet is with-outen wif,
and was so supprised with the love of Ygerne, that he
wiste not how to do, and thus departed the court; but firste the
kynge praide alle the barons to be at Cardoel at Pasch, and so he
prayed alle the ladies, and thei graunted to be ther.  Whan the
Duke of Tintagel departed fro courte, the kynge hym conveyed
and gretly hym honoured at theyr departynge; and whan he
hadde hym a while conveied, he toke leve, and yede thourgh the
courte in his othir necessitees till that the tyme of Pasch, and
than gan to assemble alle the barons and all the ladyes at
Cardoel, and grete was the ioye that the kynge made, till it come to
the mete tyme that the kynge made the Duke of Tintagel to be
set be-fore hym-self, and also his wif Ygerne, so that Ygerne ne
myght not eschewe but to resceve his yeftes, so that she it
aparceyved verily that the kynge hir loved, wherof she was
right hevy, but ne she mot it suffer.  Thus was this feeste
holden in grete ioye, and the kynge hem prayde to come at alle
tymes whan he hem comaunded, and thei seiden so thei wolden
as to theire souereyn lorde.  And thus departed the courte; and
so endured the kynge in grete mysese for love of Ygerne, and at
laste he complayned hym-self to tweyne that he moche trusted
of grete angwysshe that he suffred for the love of Ygerne, and
they seiden, "What will ye that we shull do?"  Quod the


<EPB/><PB N="65" ID="pb.65"/>

kynge, "I wolde haue youre counseile, how I myght have her
company."  And they seide, "Yef ye go in to the courte ther as
she is, the peple shull it a-perceyve, and so myght ye be in
blame."  And he seyde, "What counseile yeve ye me thanne?"
"The beste counseile," seide thei, "that we se ther-inne is that
ye somowne a grete courte to be at Cardoel, and that ye make
hem all to wite that it shall holde to the quynsine, and that eche
come araide to a-bide xv dayes, and eueriche man to brynge with
hym his wyf.  And thus may ye have longe the company of
Ygerne, and haue grete counfort of youre love."  And the kynge
was plesed wele with her counseile, and sente to alle the barons
to be at Pentecoste at Cardoel, and euery baron to brynge with
hym his wif.  And as the kynge hem comaunded thei diden, and
at that feeste the kynge bar crowne, and yaf grete yeftes to alle
astates as hym semed beste sittynge.</P><P>  Gretly was the kynge at that feeste, and ioyfull and
mery.  And he spake to oon of his counseile to whom he hadde
moste truste of eny other, and his name was Vlfyn.  And the
kynge hym tolde of the grete peyne that he was Inne for the
love of Ygerne, that so hym constrayned that he myght nother
ete ne slepe, ne go, ne ride, and that he wende verily to dye whan
he was oute of her sight, and that he myght not longe lyve but
he hadde oþer counseile of her love.  And Vlfyn seide, "Sir, it is
a wonder thynge that for the delyte of a woman ye wene to
dye.  And I am but a pore man, and yef I loved a woman so strongly

neuer speke of woman that cowde hir diffende a-geyn this; and
thow that arte a kynge dismayest the so of feynt herte!"  And
the kynge seide, "Vlfyn, thow seyst right wele, and thow
knowest wele what longeth to soche mystere; I pray the helpe
me in alle maners that thow can or may, and take of my cofres


<EPB/><PB N="66" ID="pb.66"/>

what thow wilte, to yeve to alle that ben hir a-bouten, and speke
so to hir as thow knowest is for my spede."  Quod Vlfyn, "Be
of gode counfort, for I shall do all my power."  And thus
vndirtoke Vlfin to helpe the kynge.  And so all the xv dayes hilde the
kynge grete feste, and euery day hadde the Duke in his company,
and yaf hym a grete Iuwell, and also to his compers.  And
Vlfyn spake with Ygerne, and tolde hir many thinges that he
myght, as he trowed beste her plese; and many tymes he brought
her a preciouse Iuwell; but Ygerne wolde noon <UNCLEAR>of hem</UNCLEAR>,   till
on a tyme that Ygerne hilde Vlfyn in counseile, and seide,
"Vlfin, wherefore is it that ye wolde me yeve alle these
Iuwelles and these riche yeftes?"  And Vlfin seide, "Madame,
for youre grete wisdome, and youre grete beaute and faire
contenaunce, I may noght yeve yow, for all erthely gode is yours, and
alle the londe of logres, and alle the mennes bodyes at youre
plesier to do youre volente."  And she ansuerde, "How?"
"How?" quod he, "for ye haue the herte of hym to whom alle
moste obbeye."  Quod she, "Whos herte is that ye of speken?"
And Vlfyn seide, "Of the kynge."  And she lifte vp hir hande,
and hir fayned, and seide, "A mercy god! sholde eny knyge be
traytour, so as he maketh semblaunce to myn husbonde of love,
and so shamefully wolde me diffoule!  Vlfin, now be right well
ware that thow neuer speke to me more of these wordes, ffor,
wite thow wele, I shall telle my lorde, and yef he it knowe
thow moste dye."  And Vlfyn ansuerde, "That were to me
grete wurship, yef I sholde dye for my lorde; ne neuer lady
that refused a kynge in soche wyse as do ye, that loveth yow
more than eny other thynge.  And I trowe ye do but iape; but
for goddes love haveth pite of the kynge that is youre lorde, and
also vpon youre self, for yef ye haue no mercy of this thynge,
witeth wele that ther-of may come grete harme, ne ye ne youre
lorde may not yow diffende a-geyn the kynges wille."  And
Ygerne ansuerde, wepynge, "I shall therfore me right wele
diffende, for I will neuer come in place wheras he may me
seen."


<EPB/><PB N="67" ID="pb.67"/>
</P><P>  And so departed Ygerne; and Vlfin come to the kynge, and
tolde hym like as she hadde seide.  And the kynge
seyde so sholde a gode lady ansuere, for ther was neuer gode
lady that lightly wolde be ouercome; and therfore he ne cessed
not of prayinge.  And on the xi<HI1 REND="sup">e</HI1> iour of Pentecoste, the kynge
satte at mete, and with hym te Duke of Tintagel.  And the
kynge hadde a riche cowpe of goolde; and Vlfyn kneled be-fore
the kynge, and seide, "Sir, sende this cuppe to Ygerne, and
praye the Duke to bidde hir to take it, and drynke for youre
love."  And the kynge cleped the Duke, and badde hym sende
that cuppe to Ygerne, his wif, and sende hir worde to drynke
for his love.  And the Duke ansuerde as he that thought noon
euell, and seyde, "Sir, gramercy."  The Duke cleped a knyght
of his owne that he loved well, "Bertel, take this cuppe, and
bere to thy lady, and sey her that she drynke for the kynges
love."  And Bretel cam in to the <MILESTONE N="22b" UNIT="folio"/>chamber where Ygerne sat at
mete amonge othir ladyes, and kneled be-fore hir, and seide,
"Madam, the kynge sente yow this cuppe, and my lorde
comaundeth that ye sholde it take, and also to drynke for the kynges
sake."</P><P>  Whan the lady vndirstode these wordes, she wax all reade
for shame, but she durste not refuse the comaundement
of hir lorde, but toke the cuppe, and dranke, and wolde have
sente it a-geyn be the same knyght.  And he seide, "My lorde
sente yow worde ye sholde it kepe, for so the kynge hym prayde."
When she sye that, she sigh wele that nedes she muste kepe the
cuppe.  And Bretell come a-gein, and thanked the kynge on
Ygernes be-halfe, that ther-of hadde seide no worde.  And glad
was the kynge that she hadde resceyved his yefte.  And Vlfin
wente in to the chamber, to se what semblaunce she made, and
he fonde hir pensif and angry.  And whan she saugh Vlfin, she
cleped hym to hir, for the bourdes weren vp, and seide, "Vlfyn,
thourgh grete treson thy lorde hath here sente me a cuppe, but
therby shall he gete litill wurschip er to-morow day, for I will
telle my lorde of the treson that ye be-twene yow two haue
purposed."  And Vlfyn ansuerde, "Be-war ther-of, that it yow


<EPB/><PB N="68" ID="pb.68"/>

neuer passe."  And she seide, "Mysauenture have that it kepeth
eny counseile."  With that departed Vlfyn from hir.  And be
than the kynge hadde waisshe, and was right mery and gladde,
and toke the Duke be the hande, and seide, gowe, se these
ladyes.  Than they yede to the chamber wher as Ygerne hadde
eten; and she knewe wele that he come for noon othir cause but
for hir.  And so she suffred all the day till the nyght, and
than she wente hom to hir loigynge.  And when the Duke come
he fonde hir wepynge and makynge grete sorow; wherfore he
was right hevy, and toke hir in his armes, as he that moche hir
loved, and axed whi she made soche sorowe.  "Trewly," quod
she, "ther nothynge that I will kepe from yow counseile, for
ther is nothynge that I love so moche as yow.  The kynge that
is my lorde and yowres seith that he loueth me, and alle these
courtes that ye se hym holde, and alle these ladyes that he
sendith fore, it is nought elles but for me, and that ye sholde
brynge me with yow.  And these othir tymes I parceyved it wele
I-nough, and I me kepte bothe fro hym and from his
yeftes.  And so hiderto I haue me wele deffended, that I haue nought
taken of his.  And now haue ye made me to take a cuppe, and
sente me that I sholde drynke for his love.  And therfore I
wolde I were deed, for I may neuer haue reste for hym, and
Vlfyn hys counseiller.  And now I haue tolde yow all as it is;
I knowe wele that ther-of muste come more anger, wherfore I
beseke yow, as I ought to do my lorde, that ye brynge me to
Tintagel, for I will no lenger a-bide in this town."  Whan the Duke,
that moche loved his wif, herde this, he was als wroth as eny
man myght be.  Than he sente after his men thourgh the town,
and when they were come, he seide to hem prevely, "Make yow
redy for to ride in all haste, so that no man of the town it wyte, <MILESTONE N="23a" UNIT="folio"/>and axed not the cause why till I telle yow."  And thus the
Duke and his knyghtes lepe to horse, and rode home to his contre,
and ledde with hym his wyf.</P><P>  On the morowe, whan the kynge wiste the Duke was thus
i-gon, he was hevy and sorowfull for that he hadde ledde
a-wey Ygerne, and sente after his counseile, and shewde hem the


<EPB/><PB N="69" ID="pb.69"/>

shame and the dispite the Duke hadde hym don.  And they seide
they merveyled ther gretly, and that hadde don grete
folye.  Thus seide they that wiste not why he was gon.  And the kynge
seide, "As ye haue sen alle, I haue do to hym more wurship
than to eny othir."  And they seiden, "It was soth; wherfore
we gretly merveyle why he hath don so grete outerage."  And
the kynge seide, "Yef it be youre rede I will sende after hym
that he come a-geyn and a-mende this forfet, and that in the same
wise as he is gon that he come a-gein, for that me semeth is
right."  And the counseile ther-to assented.  On this massage
was sente two worthy men fro the kynge, and rode till they
come to Tintagell, and ther they fonde the Duke, and tolde hym
their message as they weren charged.  Whan the Duke herde
that in the same forme he moste come a-geyn, he vndirstode
wele he sholde bringe with hym Ygerne, and than he seide to
the messagers, "I ne will not come at his courte, for he hath
so don to me and to myne that I owe hym neyther to truste ne
to love."  And thus departed the messagers with-outen other
ansuere.  And than the Duke sente after alle the worthy men of
his counseile, and seide hem the cause why he was come fro
Cardoel, and the vntrouthe and the shame that the kynge hadde
hym purposed.  And they ther-of merveileden gretly, and seide
that sholde neuer be-tyden with goddes grace, and wele oughten
he to haue shame that this shame hath purposed to his liege
man.  Thanne seide the Duke, "I pray yow, and requyre be the
feith that ye me owen, that ye helpe me to diffende my londe
yef he me assawte with werre."  And thei ansuerde that so
wolde they do to put alle ther lyves and gods in
Iepardye.  Thus the Duke counseiled with his men.  And the messagers
come to Cardoel and fonde the kynge and his barons, and tolde
as the Duke hadde yeve hem ansuere; and they seiden alle, thei
merveiled of the Duke, that was wonte to be so wise a man, and
so had him ruled.  The kynge praide his barons, and hem
requyred as his liege men, that thei wolde hym helpe to redresse
that forfet, and a-venge the shame that he hadde hym don; and
they seiden that they myght not that refusen; but thei seiden

<EPB/><PB N="70" ID="pb.70"/>

yef it were hys plesier to sende, knowynge that he hym diffied,
xl dayes be-fore er he hym assailed.  And the kynge seide that
wolde he do; but the kynge hem praide that at the ende of xl
dayes they be redy assembled ther he hem assigned arayed for to
osteye.  The kynge sente his messagers for to diffie the Duke of
Tintagel; and when the Duke herde that he hym diffied at the
ende of xl dayes, he seide he sholde hym diffende yef he
myght.  And than he sente to his peple, and shewde hem the diffiaunce of
the kynge, prayinge hem to helpe hym in that grete
mister.  And they seide thei sholde hym helpe with all their
power.  And than the Duke counseiled with his peple, <MILESTONE N="23b" UNIT="folio"/>and seide, "I
have but two castelles that a-gein the kynge may holde; but tho
tweyne wolde he holde as longe as he hadde lyf."  And he
devised to leve his wif at Tintagel, and with hir x knyghtes, for
he knewe that castell hadde no doute of no man, and hym-self
wente to a-nother castell that was of lesse strengthe, and it stuffed
in the beste wise that he myght, and seide that he myght not his
other londes agein hym diffende.  The messagers that hadde the
Duke diffied come to the kynge, and seide how the Duke wolde
hym diffende.  Thanne the kynge sente to somowne his barons
and his peple, and made hem alle to assemble in the Dukes londe
in a grete medowe vpon a rivere.  Whan the barons were
assembled, the kynge to hem rehersed the grete dispyte of brekynge of
his courte, and the barons seiden it was reson that the forfet
were redressed.  Thus the kynge lefte in the Dukes londes, and
toke his castelles and his townes, and distroyed all the contre,
and than the kynge herde sey that Ygerne was at Tintagel, and
the Duke in a-nother castell, and than the kynge axed of his
counseile whiche castell he sholde firste assaile; and the barons
yaf hym counseile firste to assaile the Duke, and therto the
kynge graunted.  And so thei rode to the castell that the Duke
was ynne; and than the kynge seide to Vlfin, "What may I do
whan I ne may not se Ygerne?"  And Vlfyn seide, "The
thinges that a man may not haue, he muste nede suffer; and
therfore ye must put to grete besynesse to take the Duke, for
after that ye shall well to purpos bringe the remenaunt."


<EPB/><PB N="71" ID="pb.71"/>
</P><P>  Many assaute made the kynge at the Castell, but he cowde
it in no wise gete, wher-fore he was full of sorowe, and
right Irouse.  And on the tother side he was sore distreined
with the love of Ygerne, that on a tyme, as he was in his
pavilyon, he gan to wepe.  Whanne his peple saugh hym wepe, they
weren hevy, and hem with-drowen, and leften hym a-lone.  And
whan Vlfin it wiste ther-of, he come anoon, and axed the kynge
why he wepte.  And the kynge seide, "Thow knowest wele
wherfore, for thow woste wele that I dye full of loue of Ygerne,
for I have loste bothe mete and drynke, and all reste that a man
ought to have."  And whan Vlfyn this vndirstode, he seide,
"Ye be of ful febill herte whan ye thynke to dye for oon sole
woman; but I shall sey yow gode counseile."  "What is that?"
seide the kynge.  "That ye wolde sende to seche Merlin, that he
myght come to yow, and it myght noon other-wise be, but that he
sholde yeve yow some gode counseile that sholde yow
profite.  And ye shull hym yeve what he will desire."  And than seide
the kynge, "Ther is no thynge that is possible to a man but that
he can it do; but I wote wele Merlin of my distresse knoweth,
and so I am in drede that he be wroth for the voide place of the
table, that I suffred to be assaide.  And longe tyme it is passed
sethe he was in place, where-as I myght hym se.  And also I
trowe he is not well plesed that I love the wif of my liege man;
but trewly I may not do ther-to, ne I ne may not therfro me
deffende.  But I have well in mynde that he badde I sholde not
sende hym for to seche."  And Vlfin ansuerde, "I am in certeyn
of oon thynge, that he farith well and is in hele.  Yef he love
yow as he was wonte to do, he knoweth what distresse that ye
beth ynne, and it shal <MILESTONE N="24a" UNIT="folio"/>not be longe er ye here of hym
tydynges."</P><P>  Thus Vlfyn counforted the kynge, and counseiled hym to
sende for his meyne to hym, and that sholde cause hym
to foryete a grete partie of his sorowe.  And the kynge seyde
so he wolde do; but his love myght he, ne his sorow in no maner
wise for-gete.  Thus the kynge peyned to conforte hym-self
and his peple, and made the castell to be assailed; but take


<EPB/><PB N="72" ID="pb.72"/>

it they myght not in no wise.  And on a day, as Vlfin rode
thourgh the oste, he mette with a man that he nothinge
kenned.  And he seide, "Vlfin, I wolde fain <CORR SIC="spke">speke</CORR> with the."  And
thanne they yede oute of the hoste, the man on his fete, and
Vlfyn on horsebak.  And Vlfin light down on foote to <CORR SIC="spke">speke</CORR>
with this man, and hym axed what he was.  And he seide,
"I am an olde man, as thow maist se, and som tyme in my
yowthe I was holden wise; and now of moche thinge that I sey
men sein that I dote; but I sey to yow in counseile that I was
at Tintagel not longe sithe, and ther I was a-queynted with a
gode man, that tolde me that youre kynge loueth the Dukes wif,
and that is the cause that the kynge distroyeth his contre, for
he brought his wif fro Cardoel.  And yef ye and the kynge
will wele quyte my nede, I shall make yow a-queynte with a
gode man that shall make yow speke mith Ygerne, and that shall
wele counseile the kynge of his desir."  When Vlfyn herde
this man so say, he merveled who that hym sholde haue tolde,
and prayde him that he wolde teche hym to that man that
cowde counseile the kynge of his desires.  And the olde man
seide, "I will first here what rewarde the kinge will yeve."
Quod Vlfin, "Where shall I yow fynde when I haue spoke with
the kynge?"  The olde man seide, "Ye shull finde me or my
message be-twene this and the hoste."  And so he hym
comaunded to god, and bad hym come on the morowe, and hym
wolde telle soche tydinges as sholde hym plese.  And Vlfin com
to the kynge as hastely as he myght, and tolde how the olde
man hadde seide.  And whan the kynge hadde herde these
wordes, he lowgh and made feire semblaunce, and seide to Vlfin,
"Knowest thow ought the man that thow spake with?"  And
he ansuerde, "It is a man right olde and feble."  And the kynge
seide, "Whan shull ye mete este to-geder?"  And Vlfyn seide,
"In the morowe, for he badde me wite of yow what he shulde
haue to rewarde."  And the kynge seide, "Lede me thider as
thow shalt mete with hym."  And Vlfin seide, "With gode
will; and yef thow speke with hym with-oute me, profer hym
what he will desire of myn."  Thus thei leften till on the

<EPB/><PB N="73" ID="pb.73"/>

morowe; but that nyght was the kynge merier than he hadde
ben eny tyme be-fore.</P><P>  The morowe after masse the kynge and Vlfyn rode forth as
Vlfin wolde hym guyde; and as thei issued oute of the
hoste thei sye a crepell that semed blinde; and as thei passed
forth by hym, he cried with an high voyce, "Sir kynge, so god
a-complesshe thyn hertys desire of that thow desirest moste to haue,
so yeve me som thynge that I may conne the thanke fore."  <MILESTONE N="24b" UNIT="folio"/>And
the kynge be-heilde Vlfyn, and seide lawghinge, and seide, "Vlfyn,
"Do that I shall comaunde the for my grete profite, and for my
love, and for to compleisshe my grete desire."  And Vlfyn seide,
"Ther is nothinge that I desire so moche, as for to do that myght
a-complisshe youre desire."  And the kynge seide, "Hast thow
nought herde what the Crepell axed, that I sholde remembre
the thinge that I beste loved in this worlde, and that I am moste
desiraunte.  Go and sette the a-down by hym, and sey þat I
haue sente the to hym, and ther is nothinge in this worlde that I
haue in possession, but that I wolde come to yeve it hym, yef I
durste come to se hym."  And Vlfin, with-oute eny grucchynge,
yede and yaf hym-self to the Crepill, and sette hym down by
hym.  And whan the crepill felte Vlfyn, he axed what he was,
and what he was come for to seche.  And he ansuerde, "The
kynge hath sente me to yow, and that I sholde euer be youres."
And whan the crepill that herde, he lowgh, and seide to Vlfyn,
"The kynge is sone perceyvinge, and me knoweth better than do
ye.  I will that thow wite that the olde man that thow spake
with yesterday sente me to the; but I will not telle the what he
seyde.  Go to the kynge, and sey he wolde do a grete thynge for
to haue his desire, and that I sende hym worde that sone he is
parceyvinge, and he shall spede the better."  And Vlfin seide,
"I dar nought aske what ye ben."  "Aske the kynge," quod
the crepill, "and he shall telle the wele i-nough."  And Vlfyn
lepe on horse, and priked after the kynge.  And whan the kynge
saugh hym come, he drough a-side, and seide, "Vlfyn, is it that
thow art come after me; ne have I not yove the to the Crepill?"
Quod Vlfin, "He seith that ye be sone aperceyvaunte of hym, and


<EPB/><PB N="74" ID="pb.74"/>

that ye sholde telle me what he is, for he wolde not telle me, but
seide ye sholde telle wele i-nough."  Than seide the kynge,
"Wost thow what olde man that was that spake with the
yesterday?  that same is this that thow haste seyn a crepill."  And
Vlfyn seide, "May this be true, that <CORR SIC="oo">oon</CORR> man may hym-self thus
disfigure?  And what is he than that thus hym disfigureth?"
And the kynge ansuerde, "Knowe it verily it is Merlin, that
thus hym kepeth fro yow.  And whan he will, he will make yow
wele to knowe that it is thus."  Thus they passed forth thourgh
the feilde; and Merlin come in his right semblaunce in to the
kynges teynte, and asked where was the kynge.  And a
messanger come to the kynge, and seide Merlin was come; and than was
the kynge so gladde that he myght not ansuere, but in all haste
returned, and cleped Vlfyn, and seide, "Now shalt thow knowe
yef it be so as I haue seide, for Merlyn is comen, and I knowe
wele that he doth not seke me for nought."  And than seide
Vlfyn, "Now shall it be sene yef euer ye were ought wroth, and
yef ye can other do well or sey to his plesire of alle thinges; for
ther is no man that may yow helpe so wele to haue the love of
Ygerne."  And the kynge seide, "Thow seiste soth, and ther is
no thynge that he doth comaunde me but I shall it gladly
performe."</P><P>  Thus thei rode till thei come to the teynte where as thei
fonde Merlin, and the kynge hym made grete ioye and
mery chere, and ran hym a-gein with armes spred a-brode, and
hym halsed and seide he was the man in all the worlde that was
moste to hym welcome; <MILESTONE N="25a" UNIT="folio"/>and than he seide, "Wherto sholde
I me complayne vn-to yow, for as ye it knowe as my-self, and
ther was neuer man that I longed so sore after, and I pray yow
and requyre telle me of that ye knowe my herte desireth so."
And Merlin seide, "Of that ye me asken I shall not speke
with-oute Vlfyn."  Than made the kynge to clepe after Vlfin, and
droughen hem a-side in counseile.  Than seide the kynge to
Merlin, "I haue tolde Vlfin of that ye comaunded, and that ye
were the olde man that he sigh yesterday, and also the crepill
this day."  And Vlfyn be-heilde hym strongely, and seide, "May


<EPB/><PB N="75" ID="pb.75"/>

this be trewe that the kynge seith?"  And Merlin seide, "Ye,
it is trewe with-outen faile; and as sone as I saugh he sente the
to me I wiste well he hadde me perceyved."  And than Vlfyn
seide to the kynge, "Sir, now sholde ye speke of youre gref, and
not wepe whan ye ben soill."  And the kynge seide, "I wote
not what to sey ne preyen:  he knoweth well my corage, and I
may not make hym no lesynge, but he it knowe as wele <CORR SIC="a">as</CORR> I;
but I pray hym hertely to helpe me to haue the love of Ygerne,
and he ne shall devise nothinge that is to me possible but that I
shall it gladly don."  And Merlin seide, "Yef ye will graunte
me that I shall aske, I shall purchace yow hir love, and make
yow to ly in here chamber and in hir bedde, bothe naked."  And
Vlfyn that herde, he lough and seide, "Now shall I se what a
mannes herte is worth."  And the kynge seide to Merlin, "Ye
can not aske me nothinge that be founden in this worlde, but I
sholde it yow yeven."  And Merlin ansuerde, "How may I
here-of be sure, but yef ye be sworn, and also lete Vlfyn swere,
that I shall haue that I aske on the morn that ye haue leye with
Ygerne, and don with hir youre beste?"  And the kynge seide,
"That wolde he do with gode will."  And Merlin asked Vlfyn
yef he wolde swere, and Vlfyn seide, "That me for-thinketh, for
I was neuer yet sworn in no tyme."</P><P>  When Merlin herde that worde, he lough and seide, "Whan
youre othes be made, I shall telle yow how it shall be."
Than the kynge made be brought the hiest seintewaries that he
hadde, and the beste relikes, and ther-on they dide swere as
Merlin dide hem devyse, and thei seiden thei sholde it feithfully
holde with-outen fraude or mal engyn.  After the kynge swore
Vlfyn, and thus hath Merlin taken their othes.  And than seide
the kynge, "Merlin, now I requere yow sone to helpe myn
hertes desire, as the man of all the worlde that moste ther-after
longeth to haue it complisshed."  And than seide Merlyn, "Ye
muste be wisely demened, for she is a trewe lady and full wise,
and trewe to god and to hir lorde; but now shall ye se what
power I haue hir to be-gile, for I shall make yow semblaunce of
the Duke so wele, that ther is no man that yow doth sen but he

shall wene it be the Duke.  And two knyghtes that ben moste
privy with hym, that noon ne knoweth so moche of his counseile,
not Ygerne her-silf; and that oon hight Bretell, and that other
Iordan; and I shall haue the semblaunce of Bretel, and Vlfin
shall be like Iordan, and so shall I make hem to open the gates
of the castell, and we shull alle thre ly with-Inne; but full erly
on the morow we moste gon oute, for er we departe thens we
shall here straunge tidinges, and therfore a-ray youre oste and
your barons, and comaunde hem to make gode wacche to

till that ye be come a-geyn, and be well ware that ye telle no
creature wheder that ye shall go."  And Vterpendragon dide as
Merlin hadde devised, and a-noon com agein, and seide that he
was redy, and Merlin seide how he was also redy, "there is not
ellis but to spede vs forward," and so thei wenten forth alle thre
till thei com ner at Tintagell, and than seide Merlyn to the
kynge, "A-byde ye here, and I and Vlfyn shall go this wey."
And than eche drough a-side by hym-self; and whan thei were
disseuered, and Merlin hadde don his art, he toke an herbe, and
brought it to the kynge, and seide, "Frote youre visage with this
herbe, and youre handes."  And the kynge toke the herbe, and
rubbid his handes, and his visage, and his feet; and anoon, as he
hadde thus I-don, he hadde aperteliche the semblaunce of the
Duke.  And than seide, Merlyn, "Haue ye eny mynde that euer
ye saugh Iordan?"  And the kynge seide, "Ye, I knowe hym
wele."  And Merlyn com to Vlfyn, and transfigured hym to the
semblaunce of Iurdan, and than sente hym to the kynge.  And
whan the kynge saugh Vlfyn, he hym blissed, and seide, "Mercy
god!  how may eny man make oon man so like a-nother?"  And
than he seide to Vlfyn, "How semeth the be me?"  And Vlfyn
seide, "I knowe yow nought but for the Duke."  And the kynge
seide, he was verily like vn-to Iurdan.  And as thei stoden, so
thei be-heilde Merlyn, and thei semed verily it was Bretel.  And
thus thei speken to-geder, and taried till it was nyght, and in the
evenynge thei come to the Castell gate.  And Merlyn, that wele
resembled to bretel, cleped the porter, and the peple com to the


<EPB/><PB N="77" ID="pb.77"/>

gate, and saugh apertly the Duke, as hem semed; and thei seide,
"Open: lo, here the duke."  And thei dought it was Bretel and
Iurdan, and whan thei weren entred, Bretel diffended, "that no
man in the place sholde not wite that the Duke was comen."
I-nowe ther were that yede to telle the Duchesse.  And Merlyn
toke the kynge in counseile, and seide that he sholde contene
hym-self myrily.  And a-noon alle thre thei come be-fore the
chambir where Ygerne that yet was in her bedde; and in all haste
that thei myght, thei mad their lorde redy.  And so he yede to
bedde to Ygerne; and that nyght he gat vpon hir the gode kynge
that after was cleped Arthur.  The lady made grete ioye of the
kynge, for she wende verily it hadde ben the Duke hir lorde,
that she loved moche with a trewe herte.  Thus thei lay to-geder,
till on the morowe, in the dawenynge, the tidinges com in to
the town that the Duke was dede, and also his stewarde
I-take.  And than thei com full previly in; and when these other tweyn
that tho were a-risen, herde these tidynges, thei ran ther as their
lorde lay, and seide, "A-ryse vp, and go to youre castell, for
ther be soche tydinges come hider, that oure peple wene that
ye be deed."  And he lepe vp, and seide, "It is no merveyle
though they wene so; ffor I yede oute of the castell that no man
knewe ther-of no worde."  A-noon he toke leve of Ygerne, and
hir kiste, seynge hem alle at her departynge.  And thus they
departed oute of the castell in all the haste they myght, that
neuer oon ne knewe but <CORR SIC="is">it</CORR> was the Duke.  And whan they
weren oute, thei weren right gladde.  And Merlyn seide to the
kynge, "Sir, haue ye kept wele the <CORR>couenaunte</CORR> <SIC>comenñt</SIC>  now, loke thow
kepe as wele myne."  And the kynge seide, "Ye sey trewe, for
ye haue don me the beste servise that euer man dide to a-nother;
and <MILESTONE N="26a" UNIT="folio"/>therfore youre couenauntes shall I well holde."  And Merlyn
seide, "I hem aske now, and will that they be holden."  And the
kynge seide, "I am redy hem to performe."  And than seide
Merlyn, "I will that thow knowe that thow haste engendred an
heyre male on Ygerne, and that hast thow me yoven; and


<EPB/><PB N="78" ID="pb.78"/>

therfore I shall write the houre and the day in the whiche it is
begeten, and so shalt thow knowe yef I sey soth."  Quod the
kynge, "As thow hast seide, I haue sworn, and I yeve it the
with gode will."</P><P>  Thus they rode till they come to a rivere, and ther Merlyn
did hem waisshen, and than hadde thei semblaunce as
that thei hadden be-fore.  And than the kynge rode forth as faste
as he myght; and as sone as he was come his barons and his
peple gedered a-boute hym.  And he hem asked how the Duke
was deed.  And thei hym tolden, "The day when ye were
departed the oste was stille and koye; and therby the duke
vndirstode that ye were not in the oste, and dide his peple to
arme, and come vpon vs, and dide vs grete damage er we
myghten ben armed.  The cry a-rose and the noyse, and oure
meynee hem arayde, and set on hem, and drof hem a-geyn, even
be-fore the yate.  And ther the duke a-bode, and dide many
maistries in armes.  And ther was his horse slayn and the Duke
ouerthrowe, and ther was he deed amonge oure peple on foote,
that hym nought knewen.  And we driven the remenaunt in at
the yates, that sympilly hem deffended whan they hadde loste
their lorde."  And the kynge seide he was right sory for the
deth of the Duke.

for thought the myschaunce of the Duke.  And the kynge toke
a-visement of his counseile how he myght this thinge
a-mende.  And his barons ne blamede hym nought, though he did not hate
the duke dedly, and that he were hevy for the
mysauenture.  "Truly," seide the kynge, "to my power I wolde fain make the

a-venture is thus be-fallen, it moste be a-mended in the beste wise it
may."  Than Vlfyn toke a-part the barons, and seide, "How
seme ye that this myght be amended a-geyn the lady and a-geyn
the Dukes frendes, wherof the kynge asketh yow counseile.  And
ye moste counseile hym the beste to youre power as youre lorde."
And thei seiden, "We wolde gladly rede hym the beste, and
therfore we pray yow to yeve vs counseile for oure moste
wurschip how we myght beste be demened in this matere, that the
kynge forsake not oure counseile; for we knowe wele that ye are
well in his grace."  And Vlfyn seide, "Yef I be wele in his
grace, trow ye that I sholde counseile a thynge be-hynde hym
that I sholde not sey be-fore hym; than holde ye me for a
tray-tour yef I sholde be soche.  And yef the pees and the
a-mendement to the lady lay in me, I wolde rede hym soche thinges that
ye ne durste not thynken."  And they seide, "We trowe yow
wele, and wele we knowe that ye be wise and trewe, and of
gode counseile; and therfore we pray yow to connseile vs what
were beste to requere the kynge ynne, after that we have sein
and knowe verily."  And Vlfin seide, "I shall sey yow myn
avise, and yef ye can better, sey it ye.  I rede the kynge sende
after alle the Dukes frendes, and that <MILESTONE N="26b" UNIT="folio"/>the kynge go to Tintagel,
and make alle the ladies frendes to come also be-fore hym.  And
whan they beth come be-fore hym, that he profer for the pees

thei be holde for foles, and he for a wise man and a trewe.  In
this wise, he that wele haue pees, it moste be made."  And thei
that were wise seide, "We holde vs to youre counseile, ne neuer
for vs shall he haue other."  Than they come be-fore the kynge,
and seiden the counseile that thei hadde founden; but thei ne
seide not that Vlfyn hadde it hem yoven, for so he hem hadde
praide and required.  And þus as he hadde hem enformed they
seide be-fore the kynge.  And the kynge seide to this, "I a-corde
me well, and will that it be so as ye haue devised."  And than
the kynge sente to alle the Dukes kenrede, and alle by letteres,
that thei sholde come to hym to Cardoel, and yaf gode <CORR SIC="trwys">trewys</CORR>,


<EPB/><PB N="80" ID="pb.80"/>

and that he sholde a-mende alle the fautes wherof thei cowde hem
complayne.  Thus seide the kynge be-fore alle his barons, and so
departed fro the castell.  And Merlin com to the kynge, and seide,
"Wite ye who hath yove this counseile that ye haue
comaunded."  And the kynge seide, "Nay, but that the nobill men and wise
me dide reden."  And Merlyn seide, "Amonge hem alle thei
cowde nought haue dought this rede, but Vlfyn that is wise and
a trewe knyght hath ordeyned all this pees, and the beste
ordenaunce that eny can thynke.  And wite it wele that no man
knoweth it, saue he and ye and I that he hath it seide."  And
than seide the kynge to Merlyn, "And how rede ye of this
thinge?"  Quod Merlin, "I knowe no better counseile, ne more
trewe; and so shalt thow a-complisshe thy desere of thyn herte
that thow art moste desiraunt.  And now I muste go, but first I
shall speke with the be-fore Vlfyn.  And whan I am go, thow
maiste aske Vlfin how he hath dought in makynge of this
pees."  And the kynge seide so wolde he don.</P><P>  Than was Vlfin cleped; and whan he was come be-fore them
two, Merlyn seide to the kynge, "Ye haue yove me be
your power the heyer that ye haue be-geten, and therfore it is no
reson that ye kepe hym to youre vse.  And ye haue also the hour
and the tyme I-writen that was in engendred.  And ye knowe
also that it was do be me, and so sholde myn be the synne; but
I dede it helpe, for I trowe the moder ther-of sholde be sore
a-schamed yef she her-silf dide it norish; and a woman hath no
witte ageins that she may not hiden, and a-gein the worlde.  And
therfore I will that Vlfyn make a letter of recorde that I shall

shalbe born, the nexte nyght after.  And I pray yow, as my lorde,
that ye truste well to Vlfyn, of that he shall sey vnto yow, for
he loveth yow full trewly, ne he shall not rede yow no-thynge
but for youre profite and grete wurship.  And I shall no more
speke with yow these vj monethes, but I shall speke to Vlfyn,
and therfore do be hys counseile, yef thow wilt holde trouth,
and haue my love fro hens-forth."

<EPB/><PB N="81" ID="pb.81"/>
</P><P>  In this maner kepte Vlfyn the recorde of the engenderinge of
the childe.  And Merlin toke the kynge in counseile, and
seide, "Sir, thow shalt haue Ygerne in mariage; but be wel
ware that she ne knowe not that thow leyn by her, and that is a
thinge that moste shall make hir<MILESTONE N="27a" UNIT="folio"/>in thy mercy, ffor yef thow
aske hir be whom that she is grete, she can not telle the who is
the fader, and so shall she haue of the grete shame; and also
that is a thinge that may beste helpe me to haue the childe."
And than Merlin toke leve of the kynge, and the kynge rode
forth his iourneyes till he come to a Cardoel.  And Merlin wente to
Blase, and tolde hym alle these thinges, and many other, and alle
he wrote in his boke.  And whan the kynge was come to Cardoel,
he sente after the men of hys counseile, and asked what was theire
rede in this thinge.  And thei seide, "We rede that ye make
pees with the duchesse, and with the frendes of the Duke; and
thei may well lete hir knowe that she may not hir diffende agein
yow, and that ye will do hem grete wurship to have pees with
hem; and also comaunde to go to Tintagel, to speke with the
duchesse, and with the Dukes frendes, and loke yef thei will
haue this pees; and yef youre counseilers a-corden, ye shull do
as thei desire."  Thus wente the barons to Tintagel; and the
kynge a-bode at Cardoel, and toke Vlfin in counseile, and asked
asked hym what he redde in this mater.  And he seide his rede
was to haue pees.  And the kynge seide, "Vlfin, thow haste
this pees ordeyned in thyn herte, and I wote well what."  And
Vlfin seide, "Yef I haue it purposed, and ye it knowen, than
wite ye whether it plese yow or no?"  And the kynge seide,
"It plesith me wele, and wolde fain it were don as thow haste it
devised in thy herte."  And Vlfyn seide, "Ne entermete not
yow to profer, ne to sone to graunten, for I shall it wele bringe
to gode ende."  And the kynge prayed ther-to hertely.  Thus
haue thei endid theire counseile.  And the kynges massagers
come to Tintagel, and fonde the duchesse and the frendes of the
duke.  And ther thei shewde their massage, and how that the
duke was deed thourgh hys owne outerage, and seide also how
the kynge was therfore right sory, and gladly wolde make


<EPB/><PB N="82" ID="pb.82"/>

a-mendement to the lady, and to alle his frendes.  And thei
saugh wele that thei myght not deffende hem agein the kynges
wratth, and therfore thei counseiled the lady and the frendes of
the Duke to haue pees with the kynge.  And the lady seide, and
hir frendes, thei wolde take counseile.  And so they wente
togeder; and the ladyes frendes counseiled the frendes of the duke
to haue pees with the kynge, and that he was slayn also by his
owne outrage.  "And also, ye knowe wele, we may not vs
defende agein the kynge; but lete vs here thise worthi men what
pees that the kynge will make with vs.  And in soche maner it
may be that it ought not to be refused, for of two euelles it is
gode to take the lesse; and this is oure counseile."  And the
duchesse seide, "I will not refuse the rede of yow that beth the
frendes of my gode lorde; ne I ne knowen not whom I sholde so
wele love and truste."  And thus thei com oute from this
counseile."</P><P>  And than spake oon of the worthiest and moste wise that
was on the ladies side to the kynges messagers, and seide
these wordes, "Sirs, my ladyes counseile and she wolde gladly
witen what a-mendes the kynge wolde do of hir lorde that is
deed?"  And the messagers seyden a-noon, "Lordinges, we
knowe not the will of the kynge, but thus moche he hath seide,
that he will a-mende it be the a-vise and counseile of his
barons."  And than seide they, "He shall it a-menden wele, yef god
will."  Than toke they day till the quynsyne that the lady and hir
frendes <MILESTONE N="27b" UNIT="folio"/>sholde come be-fore the kynge, for to haue right, and
to here what the kynge wolde sey, and yef the kynges profer
myght not agre the lady, and also hir frendes, thei hadde saf
condite to returne to Tintagel.  Thus was take the day of
a-mendement.  And messagers com to the kynge, and seide as thei hadde
founden, and the counseile that the lady hadde.  And the kynge
seide thei sholde haue conduyte with gode will, yef thei aske
reson.  In this manere soiourned the kynge all that woke at
Cardoel, and spake be-twene hym and Vlfyn of many thinges.  And
at the quynsyne, be counseile of his barons, he sente to the
duchesse conduyte.  And whan she was come, the kynge made


<EPB/><PB N="83" ID="pb.83"/>

aske <CORR SIC="of the lady of the lady">of the lady</CORR> and hir counseile, what a-mendes she required
for the deth of hir lorde.  The ladyes counseile ansuerde and
seide, "Sir, my lady is not comen to aske a-mendes, but for to
here what shall be don to hir for the deth of hir lorde."  And
thei that the kynge hadde made aske this demande, come to the
kynge, and seide as thei hadden herde.  And than the kynge
prased gretly theire wise ansuere; and than the kynge asked his
barons and his counseile, "What is youre rede in this mater?"
And thei seide, "That many no man knowe, saf youre-self, what
pees ye will make with hem, ne what ye will hem offre."  And
the kynge seide, "I shall sone haue tolde yow the thought of
myn herte; ye be alle my men and of my counseile, and
therfore I put it all vpon yow, and kepe ye myn honoure as ye owe to
do.  And what ye ordeyne I shall it not denye."  And they
seide, "More may we not asken; but this is yet a grete thinge
that we dar it not vndirtake; but we be right sure that ye shull
vs come no magre."  And Vlfin seide, "It semeth that ye holde
the kynge a fole, whan ye leve no thinge that he seith vnto
yow."  And thei seide, "Yesse, we trow hym wele; but we
beseche the kynge that he comaunde yow to ben oon of vs, and to
helpe vs to counseile by yowre advyse in the beste wyse that ye
can."</P><P>  Whan the kynge herde hem desire Vlfyn to be of here
counseile, he made semblaunce as he hadde be gladde, and
seide to Vlfyn, "I have norshid the, and made the a riche man,
and I knowe wele thow art wise; go forth and counseile hem
the beste that thow canste or mayste."  And he ansuerde, "So
shall I do, seth ye me comaunden; but this I will that ye knowe,
that ther is no kynge ne prince that may be to moche be-loved of
his peple, ne he may not to moche obbeye hym-self for to haue
theire hertes."  Thus wente Vlfin to counseile a-monge the barons
and the worthy men.  And whan thei were come to-geder they
asked the best rede in this cas.  And Vlfin seide, "Ye haue wele
herde how the kynge hath put hym vpon yow; now lete vs go to


<EPB/><PB N="84" ID="pb.84"/>

the lady and hir frendes, and wete yef they will holde the
same."  And thei ansuerde that he had wele seide and wisely.  And so
they yede to the lady and hir frendes, to knowe theire will.  And
whan thei were come be-fore hir, of her wordes this was the
somme.  Thei seiden how the kynge hadde a-greed hym-self all to
theire ordenaunce; "and thei we come for to knowe, yef she and
hir frendes wolde assente to the ende and a-mendes that they
wolde ordeyne in the same wise as did the kynge."  And her
frendes seide of this thei wolde take counseile.  And she toke
hir counseile to-geder what was beste to do ther-inne.  And thei
seide the kynge myght no more profer than to put hym-self in the
ordenaunce of his barons.  To this thei acorded, bothe the kynge
and the lady and her frendes, and the <CORR SIC="parentee">parentes</CORR> of the Duke, and
maden gode suertee, bothe on that oon <MILESTONE N="28a" UNIT="folio"/>part and the tother.  And
than the barons wente to-geder, and asked oon of a-nother what
was beste rede in this mater.  And whan euery man hadde seide
his advise, thei asked Vlfin what was his rede in that cas.  And
Vlfyn seide, "I shall sey myn avise, and that I say I will sey in
all places.  Ye knowe well," quod Vlfyn, "that the Duke was
deed by the kynge and by his force, and that he hadde not forfet
for to dye.  And, wite ye wele, the lady is lefte charged with
childe; and ye knowe well the kynge hath hir londe wasted
and distroyed.  And ye knowe wele also that she is oon of the
beste ladies of the worlde, and oon of the wisest; and ye knowe
also that the parentes of the Duke haue grete losse by thys deth,
and therfore it is right that the kynge restore hem agein her
londes, after that thei ben; and that he haue here hertes and hir
love.  And on the tother part, ye knowe that the kinge is
withoute wif; and I sey as be myn avise, the kynge ne may a-mende
this damage, but yef he take hir to his wif; and this me semeth
he ought wele to do for hir and for oure love, and for them of
the reeme that of this a-mendes shull heren.  And whan he hath
all thus do, and graunded that, than he first of all mary the
Dukes eldest doughter to kynge loth of Orcanye, whiche is here


<EPB/><PB N="85" ID="pb.85"/>

presente, and to his other frendens, that he do so, that they holde
hym here gode lorde and trewe kynge."</P><P>  "Now haue ye herde," quod Vlfin, "my counseile; now
may ye sey what ye semeth yef this be not to yow
a-greable."  And thei ansuerde alle with oon assent, and seide,
"Thow hast seide the beste counseile of the worlde, and the
hiest that euer man durste thynke.  And yef ye dur sey so to
the kynge as ye haue seide here, and that we may se he therto
a-corde, and we shull yow helpe ther-to right gladly."  And Vlfin
ansuerde, "Ye ne sey not i-nough, but yef ye will ther-to a-corde
playnly, I shall reherse the wordes to the kynges presence.  And
lo, here the kynge of Orcanye, on whom I sey grete parti of the
pees, and therfore lete vs here hys avise."  And the kynge loth
seide, "For ought that ye haue seide touchinge me, I will not
that the pees be lefte."  And whan thise othir herde this, thei
a-corden to this counseile alle, and com to the kynges
teinte.  And the lady was sente fore, and alle that weren of hir
counseile.  And whan thei were alle assembled, thei sat alle, saf
Vlfin; he was stondinge, and rehersed the a-corde of the pees as
it was be-fore spoken.  And than he seide to the barons, "Be ye
not alle thus a-corded?"  And they seiden alle, "Yesse."  Than
he turned to the kynge, and seide, "Sir, how sey ye to this
thinge; will ye ther-to agreen to the acorde and ordenaunce
of these worthy lordes?"  And the kynge seide, "Ye, yef the
duchesse and her frendes be contente, and that the kynge loth
will for me take the Dukes doughter."  And than ansuerde the
kynge loth, "Sir, ther is nothinge that ye me requyre for youre
love or youre profite but I will it gladly performe."  Than spake
Vlfyn to hym that hadde the wordes for the duchesse, a-lowde,
that alle it myght heren, and seide, "Assente ye to this pees and
acorde?"  And ansuerde full wisely and pitously, be-holdinge
his lady and her counseile, of whom the tounges of hir hertes
were at hir yen, so that thei gonne wepe for ioye and pite; and
he also that ansuerde to Vlfyn dide wepe, and seide that so high
and wurschipful a-mendes <MILESTONE N="28b" UNIT="folio"/>dide neuer a lorde to his man.  And
than the lady and hir counseile toke theire avisement, and thei


<EPB/><PB N="86" ID="pb.86"/>

seiden, "Ther is no man in the worlde but he ought her-to
assenten; wherfore we rede in-as-moche as we se that the kynge
is so gracious a man and so trewe, that after alle these wordes
we submytte vs holy to his ordenaunce."  And thus was the
pees graunted on that <CORR SIC="o">oon</CORR> side and the tother.  And so
Vterpendragon toke Ygerne to his wif, and maried her doughter to kynge
loth of Orcanye.  The weddynge of the kynge and Ygerne was
the xxti day after that he hadde by hir leyn in hir
chamber.  And of her doughter that was maried to kynge loth com Gawein,
Agrauuayn, Gaheret, and gaheries, and mordred.  And the kynge
uentres of Garlot hadde a-nother of hir doughters, that was geten
on baste, whos name was Morgeins.  And be the counseile of alle
hir frendes the kynge sette hir to skole in an house of religion, and
she lerned so moche of an arte that is cleped astronomye, wher-in
she wrought many tymes; and by that crafte was she cleped
morgne-le-fee.  The other doughters alle the kynge dide marye,
and moche he dide for the Dukes kyn and frendes.</P><P>  Thus was the kynge wedded to Ygerne, and kepe her till her
gretnesse apered.  And as the kynge on a nyght lay with
her, he asked with whom she was so grete, and þat she myght
not be so grete with hym, seth the tyme thei were wedded, ffor
he hadde neuer tyme with her leyn but that the tyme was
wreten; ne she ne myght be grete by the Duke, for longe tyme
be-fore his deth she hadde not hym seyn.  Thus the kynge oposed
Ygerne, and she hadde grete drede, and seide wepinge, "Sir, of
this that ye sey I may make to yow no lesynge, ne of other
thinges shall I not lyen; ffor oure lordes love, haue mercy on
me, and I shall telle yow a merveile that is very soth, yef ye
will me assure, yef it plese yow, that ye shull not me
forsaken."  Quod the kynge, "Seith on hardely, for I will not departe fro
yow in no wise for nothinge that ye sey."  And than was the
quene glad, and seide, "Sir, I shall telle yow a wonder
thinge."  And she tolde hym how a man hadde leyn with hir in semblaunce
of the Duke, and brought with hym two men in semblaunce of
two that the Duke loved beste of all the worlde.  And thus com
he to my chambir, seinge alle my peple, and lay with me.  And

<EPB/><PB N="87" ID="pb.87"/>

I wende verily it hadde be my lorde; and he be-gate the childe
that I am now with so grete.  And I knowe wele it was that
same nyght that my lorde were slain, for he lay with me whan
tydinges com of my lordes deth.  And than made he me to
vndirstonde that he was my lorde, and that his peple ne wisten
not that he was come to me.  And so he departed, when he hadde
herde these tidinges, and seide to me, 'Feire wif, loke than noon
this knowe, as moche as ye may kepe this secret, for so sholde ye

wise, that so grete a thinge durste yow counsell.  And ye haue
also wele spedde the entente of Merlin, that in other maner ne
myght haue the childe that she is with grete."  Thus they
endured to the vj monethes ende, that Merlyn hadde sette to
speke with Vlfyn previly, and hym asked tydinges of that he
wolde; and when thei hadde spoke to-gedir, he sente after the
kynge be Vlfyn.  And whan they were alle thre assembled, the
kynge tolde Merlin how he hadde do with the quene, and how he
hadde made the pees for to haue the childe.  And Merlin seide,
"Vlfyn is som-what a-quytte of the synne that he hadde in the
love makinge, but I am not yet a-quyt of that; I helped to
disseyve the lady ne of the childe that she hath with-inne hir,
of whom she wote not who is the fader."  And the kynge seide,
"Ye be so gode and so wise that ye can yow wele in this
a-quyten."  And Merlin seide, "Ther-to moste ye helpe."  And
the kynge seide he wolde hym helpe in all the maner that he
can, and the childe wolde he make hym to haue.  And Merlin


<EPB/><PB N="88" ID="pb.88"/>

seide, "Ther is in this contre a gode man, that is oon of the
trewest of all thi reame; and he hath a wif that is gode
woman and a wise, and the trewest of this londe and beste
tacched of alle gode condiciouns; and she is now leide down in
hir bedde of a childe male, and hir lorde is not moste riche man;
ther-fore I wolde that ye sende for hym, and yeve so of youre
goode, that he and the gode lady his wif swere on a boke to kepe
a childe that shalbe brought vnto them, and that she yeve it soke
of hir owne mylke, and hir owne childe to be put to a-nothir
woman to be norisshed, and that they norisshe and kepe that
childe that shalbe brought vnto hem."  And the kynge seide,
"Euen as thow haste seide, so shall I do."  And Merlin toke his
leve, and wente to Blase.  And Vterpendragon sente after this
noble knight; and whan he was come, the kynge made hym gret
chere; and merveiled why the kynge made hym soche grete
feeste.  And the kynge seide, "Dere frende, I most discure to
yow a merveile that is me be-fallen, and ye be my lege man, and
therfore I pray yow for the feith that ye owen vnto me, that ye
me helpe, after that I haue seide yow my counseile, and that ye
kepe it secrete to youre power."  And he ansuerde, "Syr, ther is
nothinge that <CORR SIC="y">ye</CORR> sey to me, or commaunde me to do, but that I
shall do it with  all my power; and yef it be a thynge that I may
not do, I shall it wele counseile."  And the kynge seide, "Ther
is be-falle to me a wondir thynge in my slepe: of a man that
come be-fore me, and seide ye be the worthiest man of all my
reame, and moste trewe to me; and also he seide that ye hadde
engendered on youre wif a childe that is born; and he badde me
that I sholde pray yow to put youre owne childe to sowken
a-nother woman, for my love, and youre wif to yeve the childe
sowken of her owne mylke that <MILESTONE N="29b" UNIT="folio"/>shall be brought vn-to hir, and
it kepe and norisshen."</P><P>  Whan the gode man herde this ansuere, "Sir, this is a
grete thynge that ye me requyre: that I sholde my
childe disseuer from his nature, and make hym to be norisshed of
a-nothir woman; and, sir, I pray yow, when shall this childe be
born, and to me be brought?"  And the kynge seyde, "So god

me helpe, I wote neuer."  And than seide the knyght, "Sir,
<CORR SIC="ther ther">ther</CORR> is nothinge in this worlde that ye me comaunde but I shall
it don."  Than the kynge yaf hym so grete yeftes that he was
all astoned ther-of, and com home to his wif, and tolde her as
the kynge hadde seide.  And whan she it herde, she thought
it a straunge thinge, and seide, "Sir, how may I that do,
for to leve my sone for another mannes?"  And the gode man
seide,  "Ther is nothinge but that we moste it do for hym
that it oure sourein lorde; and he hath yoven vs so moche,
and promysed, that we moste nede don hys plesir and his
volunte, and I will verily that ye it graunten."  And she
ansuerde, "I am yowre and the childe youre, therfore do with
me and with hym youre will; and I it graunten wele, for I
ought in no wise to do agein your volunte."  Than he bad hir
ordeyne a-nother woman to norissh hir sone, for he dide but
a-waite after the hour that the tother sholde be brought; and
thus disseuerid the gode man his sone fro his wif.  And the
kynge sawgh that the quene was redy to ly down.  And the day
be-fore com Merlin to court secretly, and seide to Vlfyn, "I am
wele plesed with the kynge, for he hath wele do as I seide to
hym.  Now go, bid hym go to the quene, and bid hym telle her
that shall haue chylde to-morow at nyght, after mydnyght, and
comaunde her that she do the childe to be delyuered to the firste
man that shall mete at issue of the halle."  And whan Vlfyn
herde that, he seide, "Shull ye not speke with the kynge?"
And Merlin seide, "No."  Than com Vlfyn to the kynge, and
seide as Merlin hadde comaunded.  Whan the kynge herde that, he
made grete ioye, and seide, "Shall I not speke with Merlyn er
he go?"  And Vlfin seide, "Nay; but do as he hath sente yow
worde."  Than yede the kynge to the quene, and seide, "I shall
telle yow a thynge that ye shall fynde trewe, and doth as I shall
comaunde yow."  And she seide, "Sir, I will do as ye comaunde."
And the kynge seide, "To-morow, after mydnyght, with the
grace of god, ye shull be deliuered of the childe in youre

wombe; And I pray yow and require that as soone as it is born
that ye take it to oon of youre moste secrete woman, and bid hir
deliuer it to the firste man þat she fyndeth at the issue of the
halle; and that ye sey to hem that be at the birthe of the childe
that they speke neuer worde ther-of, ne discure that ye hadde
childe, for moche peple shull sey than that it were neuer myn,
ne me semeth not it sholde be."  And the lady ansuerde, "Sir,
that I haue tolde yow is trewe;" and seide, "I knowe not who it
be-gat; and I shall do that ye comaunde as she that hath grete
shame of hir mysauenture.  But of this haue I grete merveile:
that ye knowe so wele my delyueraunce; and I pray yow that ye
do as I yow say;" and seide, "So shall I do so god be myn
helpe."  Thus departed the counseile of the kynge and the quene.  And
she a-bode as longe as god wolde.  And the morowe after
evesonge toke hir grete disese of trauelinge, vnto the hour that the
kynge hadde hir seide, and a-noon after mydnyght she was
delyuerid.  And than a-noon she cleped a woman that she moste
trusted, and seide, "Take this childe, and bere it to the halle
dore, and yef ye fynde ther a man that it aske, deliuere it to
hym, and take gode hede what man he be."  This <MILESTONE N="30a" UNIT="folio"/>woman dide
as the quene comaunded; toke the childe, and folded it in the
beste clothes that she hadde, and bar it to the halle dore; and
whan she come ther, she fonde a man that semed right olde
and rympled.  And she seyde, "What a-bidest thow after?"
And he seide, "For that that thow bringeste."  And she seide,
"What man art thow; to whom shall I telle my lady that I
haue yoven her childe?"  Quod he, "Ther-of hast thow nought
to done, but do as thow art comaunded;" and toke hym the
childe.  And a-noon as he it hadde, she wiste not where he was
be-comen, and com ayen to the lady, and seide she hadde yove
the childe to right an olde man; but I wote not what he is elles,
for as <CORR SIC="sone as sone as">sone as</CORR> I hadde it hym delyuered he was vanysshid in

wepe, as she that hadde grete doel, and he that hadde this childe


<EPB/><PB N="91" ID="pb.91"/>

yede as faste as he myght to Antor, and fonde hym erly, as he
was goinge to masse.  And he hadde take the semblaunce of a
moche olde man, and called to hym, and seide, "Antor!  I
wolde speke with the." "And I with yow," quod he gladly.
The olde man seide, "I haue brought the a childe, and I pray
the that thow do it norisshe as richely as thow wolde do thyn
owne.  And, wite thow wele, yef thow do thus, grete gode shall
come to the and thyn heyres; and yef a man tolde it the, thow
woldest it not be-leve."  And Antor ansuerde, "This is the
childe that the kynge me praide to norisshe of my wif, and to
put a-wey myn for hym."  And he seide, "It is the same
saunzfaile; and the kynge and all worthi men and worthi wemen
oughten the to preyen, and I my-self the preye; and, wite it well,
that my prayer is as moche worth as a riche mannes."  Antor
toke the childe, and saught it was right faire, and asked yef it
were cristned, and he saide, "Nay; but now a-noon do it baptise
in this chirche."  And Antor toke it gladly, and asked of hym
"What shall be his name?"  And he seide, "My rede is that
thow clepe it Arthur, and thow shalt fynde that it shall falle
to the grete welthe, er thow haue it kept longe while.  And
thow ne thy wif shall not wite whethir thow shalt love better of
thi childe or hit."</P><P>  Antor seide, "Who shall I sey hath take me this childe, and
what man ye be?"  And he seide, "Ye shall not knowe at
this tyme no more of me."  And thus thei departed, and Antor
made the childe to be baptised, and cleped hym Arthur, and bar
hym to his wif, and seide, "Lo, here the childe that I haue yow
so moche I-praide fore."  And she seide, "It is welcome."  And
she toke it, and asked yef it were baptised.  And he seide, "Ye,
and his name is Arthur."  Than the lady yaf it sowke, and it
norisshed, and put her sone to a-nothir woman.  And
Vterpendragon hilde after the londe longe tyme; and so he fill in a grete
sekenesse of the gowte in handes and feet.  And thanne a-ros the
Danes in many places of the londe a-gein hym, and dide grete
outrage; so that he sente for his barons, and asked theire
counseile.  And the barons redden to be avenged vpon hem, yef he

myght.  Than seide Vterpendragon, "I pray yow assemble yow
a power as worthi men owe for theire lorde."  And thei seide
thei wolde so with gode will.  And so they yede, and met
with their enmyes, and saugh that thei hadde drawe to hem
grete part of the londe.  And the kynges men were with-outen
a lorde assembled, and were discounfited; and so loste the kynge
grete part of his men.  Whan the kynge herde tydinges that his
men were discounfited, he was full wroth.  Than come the
remenaunte from the bataile.  <MILESTONE N="30b" UNIT="folio"/>And whan the tother party hadde
discounfited this bataile, thei encresed moche of peple, and wexed
right stronge.  And Merlin, that alle these thinges knewe, com
to Vterpendragon, that for his maladie was right feble.  And
whan he wiste that Merlyn was come, he was gladde, and
thought in his herte that now he sholde haue counfort.  Whan
Merlin come be-fore Vterpendragon, he made hym right feire
chere.  And Merlin seide, "Ye be right seke, and gretly ye be
afraide."  And Vterpendragon seide, "I haue right, for my men,
and that ye knowe wele, and that I wende to haue no drede of,
haue distroyde my reame, and slayn my men in bataile."  And
Merlin seide, "Now maist thow se that peple ne a-vaile not in
bataile with-oute a gode lorde."  And the kynge seide, "For
godes love, Merlin, counseile me what I shall do."  And Merlin
seide, "I will telle the a thynge in previte, that I will tho
byleve: make somowne all thyn oste an thy peple; and whan
thei be alle come, do the to be bore in a lytier, and so go fight
with thyn enmyes; and, wite it verily, thow shalt hem
venquise.  And whan thow hast hem venquysed, thow shalt knowe well
what a londe is worth that is with-outen a kynge.  And whan
thow hast thus don, departe for god, and for thy soule all thy

diden er it be departed, that the merite of the godes be not

were better to the richeman that he hadde neuer nought I-hadde,
but he departe in his lif tyme.  The richesse and the honoures

but yef he haue gode ende; and yef thow haddest do alle the
gode dedes of the worlde, and thyn ende were euell, thow were

no more with the to do; but bid Vlfyn to yeve credence to me
whan myster is, and than he helpe me to bere trewe witnesse

seide, "This is a ferly thinge that thow hast seide, I sholde
venquyse myn enmyes in a litere; how may I that yelde to oure
lorde?" And Merlin seide.  "By thi gode ende.  And now I go;
I pray the, after the bataile, haue mynde of that I haue the
seide."  And Vterpendragon asked tidinges of the childe that he
bar a-wey.  And Merlin seide, "Of that ne recche the nothinge

is feire and well growen, and well taught and norisshed."  And
the kynge asked, "Shall I se yow euer eny more after
this?"  And Merlyn seyde, "Ye, ones, and neuer no more."</P><P>  Thus departed the kynge and Merlin.  And the kynge
somowned his oste, and seide he wolde go with hem on
his enmyes.  Than he was ledde in a letere; and the sarazins com
and fought with hym.  And the kynges men, be the counseile of
her lorde, discounfited their enmyes, and slowen grete plente;
that hadde the kynge the victorye of the bataile, and venquysed
his enmyes.  And so the londe was set in pees; and than he
be-thought hym of that Merlin hadde hym seide, and repeired to
london, and sente for his grete tresour, and yaf his godes to gode men
and gode women, and to mysese peple of his reame, and dide
many faire almesse dedes; and the remenaunt he dide departe be
the advise of his mynistres to holy cherche.  Thus departed the
kynge his tresoure, that nought be lefte to hym-self wher-of he
cowde remembre, that he ne yaf all for the love of god by the
counseile of Merlyn.</P><P>  Full meke was the kynge a-gein god and the peple, and a-gein
the mynistres of holy cherche, that alle thei hadde grete
pite.  Thus was he kepte longe tyme seke; and his peple were
assembled at london, that grete doute hadde of his deth.  And
thei knewe wele that dye he moste, for he wax so feble that he
myght not speke in thre dayes.  Than com Merlin in to the town,
that all this wiste wele.  And whan he was come, the worthi
men maden hym to come be-fore them, and seiden, "Merlyn,
now is the kynge deed that ye loved so wele."  And Merlin
seide, "Ye sey not wele; noon shall dye that maketh so gode
ende as he doth; ne he is not yet deed."  And thei seide, "That
he is, for this thre dayes he spake no speche, ne neuer shall speke
worde."  And Merlin seide, "Yef god will he shall speke; now,
come, and ye shall heir hym speke."  And they seide that than
he dide grete merveile.  Than thei rede ther as the kynge lay,
and opened alle the wyndowes; and than thei seide, "Sir, lo
here Merlin."  And the kynge turned toward hym to his power,
and made semblaunce that he knewe hym.  And Merlyn seide to

that the kynge shall speke."  And than thei drough nere, and
seide, "Trowest thow to make hym speke?" And Merlin seide,
"Ye shull se."</P><P>  Than Merlyn turned hym on the tother side of the pailet,
and rowned in the kynges ere, and seide, "Thow haste
made a faire ende, yef thi conscyence be soche as the semblaunce;
and I telle the thi sone Arthur shall be kynge nexte of thy reame

rounde table that thow haste be-gonne."  Whan the kynge herde
that, he drough towarde hym, and seide, "For godes love, pray
hym to pray oure lorde Ihesu criste for me."  And Merlin seide
to hem that ther were, "Now haue ye herde the last worde that
the kynge hath spoke to me; and ye wende that he shulde neuer
haue spoken," And than wente Merlin, and alle the other that
hadden grete merveile of Merlin that he hadde made hym to
speken, ne ther was noon that wiste what the kynge hadde seide,
saf Merlin.  Thus ended the kynge, and the princes, and the
barons, and bisshopes and archebisshopes dide hym the grettest
honoure and the feirest servise that thei myght.  Thus lefte the
londe with-outen heyre.  The morowe after the kynge was
biried assembled the barons and the prelates of the cherche, and
toke counseile how the reame sholde be gouerned, and neuer

his pleasaunce as he was bore on this day, so euery man praye in
the beste wise he can."  And thus they did as the gode men
hem counseiled; and <MILESTONE N="32b" UNIT="folio"/>he yede forth to messe and he com to the
gospell, and that thei hadden offred.  Some of the peple yede
oute of the cherche where ther was a voyde place; and whan
they com oute of the cherche thei sawgh it gan dawe and clere,
and saugh be-fore the cherche dore a grete ston foure square,
and ne knewe of what ston it was; but some seide it was
marble.  And a-bove, in the myddill place of this ston, ther stode a styth
of Iren that was largely half a fote of height, and thourgh this
stithi was a swerde ficchid in to the ston.</P><P>  When thei sye this that firste weren come oute of the
chirche, thei hadde gret merveile, and yede a-gein into
the chirche, and tolde the archebisshop.  And whan the gode
man that sange masse herde this, he toke haly water, and caste
vpon the stith.  And the archebisshop lowted to the swerde, and
sawgh letteres of golde in the stiel; and he redde the letteres,
that seiden, "Who taketh this swerde out of this ston sholde be
kynge by the eleccion of Ihesu criste."  And when he hadde
redde this letteres, he seide to the peple what it ment.  Than
was the ston deliuered to x worthi men to kepe, and to two
clerkes.  Than thei seiden that oure lorde hadde hem shewed
feire myracle; and yeden a-gein in to the mynistre to heir oute
the masse, and to yelde oure lorde graces.  And thei soungen 'te
deum laudamus.'  And whan the gode man was come to the
awter, he turned to the peple, and seide, "Feire lordes, now may
ye se that some of yow be goode men, when thourgh youre prayers
and orisouns oure lorde hath shewde this grete myracle; wherfore
I praye and reqire yow a-boue alle vertues in this erthe, for
highnesse ne erthly richesse that god hath yoven in this worlde,
that noon be a-gein this eleccion that god hath vs shewde the
demonstraunce, and the surpluys he shall vs shewen at his
volunte."


<EPB/><PB N="99" ID="pb.99"/>
</P><P>  Thanne the godeman sange forth the masse; and whan it
was fynisshed, they assembled a-boute the ston, bothe
oon and other who that myght take oute this swerde firste.  And
than thei seiden and a-corded alle that thei sholde assaien it, as
the mynistres of holy cherche wolde assigne.  To this ther was
grete discorde amonge the higheste men and moste puyssaunt;
and thei that hadde force seide they wolden asseyen firste; so
ther were many wordes that ought not to be rehersed.  The
archebisshop spake that alle myght here, and seide, "Sirs, ye ne
be not so wise, ne so wele a-vised men as I wende.  And I will
wele þat ye alle wite that oure lorde hath oon i-chosen, but I
knowe not whom.  And thus moche may I say to yow, that
gentilnesse ne richesse shall haue no power a-gein the wille of
Ihesu criste, but truste so moche in hym, that yef he that is
ther-to chosen were yet vn-bore, it shall neuer be taken oute of
the ston till he come that it is ordeyned the honour."  Than
a-corded alle the noble men and wise, and seide that he hadde
seide soth.  And the wise men and the high barouns toke their
counseile, and a-corded to stonde the ordenaunce of the
archebisshop, and com a-gein, and seiden heringe alle the peple.  And
than made the bisshop grete ioye, and dide wepe for pite, and
seide, "This humylite that is in youre hertes is of god; and I
will that ye knowe after <MILESTONE N="33a" UNIT="folio"/>myn entente, shall be to the volunte of
god and profite of cristen feith, so that I shall haue no blame yef
god will."  This parlament was be-fore high messe of the assay
of the swerde, till that high messe was saide.  Than seide the
Archebisshop to the peple, and shewed hem the gret myracle
that god hadde don for hem at this eleccion, "and whan oure
lorde sette Iustice in erthe, he sette it in the styth and in the
swerde; and the Iustice ouer the lay peple ought to be the
swerde, ffor the swerde at the be-gynynge was take to thre orderes
to diffende holy cherche, and mayntene right witnesse.  And
oure lorde hath now made eleccion be the swerde; and, wite it
wele, alle that this haue seen and be-holde to whom he will the
Iustice yeve.  And lete no man be to hasty for to assaye, for it
shall neuer be drawen oute for richesse, ne for pride; ne the


<EPB/><PB N="100" ID="pb.100"/>

poure peple be not displesed, though the lordes and the high
astates assaye be-fore, ffor it is right and reson that the lordes
assaien firste; for ther ne is noon of yow but he ought to haue
his kynge and his lorde, the beste and moste worthy man that he
kowthe knowe be his reson."</P><P>  Thus thei acorded to the archebisshop with gode herte, and
with-outen euyll will, that he sholde chese hem that he
wolde to assaye firste.  Thus thei graunted alle to holde hym for
hir kynge, to whom god wolde shewe his grace.  Thanne the
arche-bisshop chese oute C.l. of the hiest and moste worthi lordes,
and made hem go to the assaie.  And whan they hadde alle
assayed, than he commaunded alle other to assaye.  And than they
assayden alle they, oon after a-nother, that assaye wolde; but
ther was noon that myght it taken oute.  And so it was
comaunded to be kept with x noble men; and thei were charge to
take goode hede who com to assaien, and yef eny ther were that
myght drawen out of the ston.  Thus was the swerde assaied
alle þe viij dayes, and alle the barouns were at high messe; and
the archebisshop hem preched, and shewde as hym semed
beste.  And than he seide, "I tolde yow wele that all be leysere myght
he come that was ferthest fro the assaye of this swerde; now
may ye verily knowe that neuer noon, saf he that oure lorde
will, ne shall it not oute take."  And than thei seiden alle that
thei wolde not out of the town, till thei westen to whom god
wolde graunte that honoure.  In that maner thei a-biden oute the
messe, and after thei wente to their hosteles to mete, and after
mete, as they were vsed that tyme, yede the barouns and the
knyghtes to boorde in a feire pleyn, and the x men that were
ordeyned to kepe this swerde, yede also to se this bourdise.  And
when the knyghtes hadde turneyd a-while, thei toke their
sheldes to their squeres, so that the peple of the town yede to
arme them.  And Antor hadde made his eldeste sone knyght at
the halowtide be-fore yoole.  And whan the medle was be-gonne,
Kay called his brother Arthur, and seide, "Go faste to oure oste,
and fecche my swerde."  And Arthur was goode and seruisable,
and seide, "With gode will;" and than smote the hors with the

<EPB/><PB N="101" ID="pb.101"/>

spores, and rode forth to his ostell for to fecche his brothers
swerde, or ellis some other, yef he <MILESTONE N="33b" UNIT="folio"/>myght eny fynde.  And he
fonde noon, ffor the hostesse hadde sette it in hir chambir.  And
so he turned to hem a-gein; and whan he saugh he myght noon
fynde, he gan to wepe for grete anger.  And as he come be-fore
the mynster ther the ston was, he saugh the swerde whiche he
hadde neuer assaide, and thought yef he myght it gete to bere it
to his brother.  And as he com ther-by on horse bakke, he hente
the swerde be the hiltes and drough it oute, and couered it with
his lappe.  And his brother that a-bode after with-oute the towne
saugh hym come, and rode a-gein hym, and asked his
swerde.  And Arthur seide he myght not haue it; "but I haue brought
heere a-nother," and drough it oute from vndyr his cote, and
toke it to his brother.  And a-noon, as Kay saugh this swerde, he
knewe it wele that it was the swerde of the ston, and thought
he wolde be kynge, and seide he wolde seche his fader till he
fonde hym, and than he seide, "Sire, I shall be kynge; lo, here
is the swerde of the ston."</P><P>  Whan the fader it saugh, he hadde merveile how he it
gatt.  And he seide he toke it oute of the ston.  Whan
Antor herde that, he leved it not, but seide he dide lye.  Than
thei yede to the mynster, ther the ston was, and the tother
squyre after.  Whan Antor sigh the ston, and the swerde not
ther-ynne, he seide, "Feire sone, how hadde ye this swerde?
Loke ye, do not lye; and thow do lye, I shall it know wele, and
neuer shall I the love."  And he ansuerde as he that was sore
a-shamed, "I shall yow lye no lesynge, for my brother Arthur it
me brought whan I badde hym to go fecche myn, but I wote
neuer how he it hadde."  Whan Antor herde this, he seide,
"Sone, yeve it me, for ye haue ther-to no ryght."  And Kay it
deliuered to his fader; and he loked be-hynde hym, and saugh
Arthur, and cleped hym, and seide, "Come hider, faire sone,
and take this swerde, and put it ther as ye it toke."  And he
toke the swerde, and put it in the stith, and it heilde as wele, or
better, than it dide be-fore.  And Antor comaunded his sone Kay
to take it oute; and he assaied, but it wolde not be.  Than


<EPB/><PB N="102" ID="pb.102"/>

Antor cleped hem bothe, and seide to Kay, "I wiste well that
thow haddest not take the swerde oute."  Thanne he toke
Arthur in his armes, and seide, "Feire dere sone, yef I myght
purchase that ye be kynge, what gode sholde I haue therfore?"
"Ffader," quod he, "I may nother haue that honour, ne noon
other goode, but that ye be ther-of lorde, as my lorde and my
fader."  And he seide, "Sir, youre fader I am as in norture, but
certes I dide yow neuer engender, ne I wot neuer who dide yow
engender."  Whan Arthur saugh that Antor hym denyed to ben
hys fader, he wepte tendirly, and hadde grete doel, and seide,
"Feire sir, how sholde I haue this dignite, or eny other, whan I
haue failed to haue a fader."  "A fader muste ye nede haue;
but, feire dere sir, yef oure lorde will that ye haue this grace,
and I helpe yow it to purchase, telle me what I shall be the
better?"  And Arthur seide, <MILESTONE N="34a" UNIT="folio"/>"Sir, so as ye will youre-self."
Thanne Antor tolde hym what bounte he hadde hym don, and how
he hadde hym norisshed, and how he put a-wey his sone Kay,
and made hym to be norisshed of a straunge woman; "where-fore
ye owe to yeve my sone and me guerdon, ffor ther was neuer
man more tenderly norisshed than I haue yow.  Wherefore I
praye yow, yef god yeve yow this grace, and I may helpe yow
ther-to, that ye guerdon me and my sone."  And Arthur seide,
"I praye yow that ye denye not me to be my fader, for than I
sholde not wite wheþer that I sholde go; and yef ye may helpe to
purchase this grace, and god will that I haue it, ye can no-thinge
sey ne comaunde but I shall it do."  And Antor seide, "I shall
not aske thi londe; but thus moche I will praye yow, that yef ye
be kynge, that ye make my sone Kay youre stywarde in soche
maner that for no forfet that he do to yow, ne to man of youre
londe, that he lese not hys office; and yef he be fool, or fell, or
vilenis, ye owe better to suffre hym than eny other; and
therfore I praye yow to graunte hym that I yow demaunde."  And
Arthur seide he wolde it do with gode will.  And than he ledde
hym to the auter, and swore that he sholde this trewly
performe.  And whan he hadde sworne, he com be-fore the mynster; and
the turment was ended, and the barouns com to hire evesonge.


<EPB/><PB N="103" ID="pb.103"/>
</P><P>  Than Antor cleped alle his frendes, and com to the
Archebisshop, and seide, "Sir, lo, here is a childe of myn that
is no knyght, that prayeth me that I wolde helpe that he myght
assay the auenture of the swerde, and that it plese yow to clepe
the barouns."  And so he did; and thei assembled a-boute the
ston.  Than Antor bad Arthur take oute the swerde, and delyuere
it to the Archebisshop.  And Arthur toke the swerde be the
hiltes, and with-oute more taryinge yaf it to the
Archebisshop.  And a-noon he toke Arthur in his armes, and seide "Te deum
laudamus," and so brought hym in to the mynster.  And the
barouns and high men, that this hadde seyn and herde, were angry
and sorowfull for this, and seiden it myght not be that soche a
symple man of so lowe degre sholde be lorde of hem
alle.  Therwith was the Archebisshop displesed, and seide, "Sirs, oure lorde
knoweth beste what euery man is."  And Antor and his frendes
abode by Arthur, and alle the comen peple; and alle the barouns
were a-geyn them and a-geyn Arthur.  And thanne seide the
archebisshop wordes of grete hardynesse, "I do yow to wite
thaugh alle thei that ben in the worlde wolde be a-gein this
eleccion, and oure lorde will that this man be kynge, he shall be
it with-outen faile; and I shall shewe yow how, and what
affiaunce I haue in oure lorde Ihesu criste.  Now, feire brother
Arthur, go, put the swerde a-geyn in the same place that ye toke
it fro."  And Arthur put the swerde a-geyn in the selue place,
and it hilde as faste as by-fore.  And than seide the
Archebisshop, "So feire eleccion was neuer sene; now go ye, riche
barouns and lordes, and assay yef ye may take oute the swerde."
Than yede alle for to assaye, but noon it myght remeve fro the
place that it was Inne.  Than seide the archebisshop, "Grete
folye do ye that be a-geyn oure lordes wille; for <MILESTONE N="34b" UNIT="folio"/>now ye se well
how it is."  And thei seide, "Sir, we ne be not a-gein oure
<CORR SIC="lodes">lordes</CORR> wille; but it ys grevouse thinge to vs to haue a garcion
to be lorde ouer vs alle."  And the archebisshop seide, "He that
hath hym chosyn knoweth beste what he is."  Thanne the
barouns praide the bisshop to lete the swerde be stille in the ston
till Candelmesse; and by that tyme men of ferther contrees


<EPB/><PB N="104" ID="pb.104"/>

myght come to assaye the auenture.  And the archebisshop hem
graunted.  Than come oute of euery contree, and asseyde who
that wolde.  And whan they hadden assaied, the archebisshop
seide, "Arthur, yef it be pleser to oure lorde Ihesu criste that
thow be kynge, go forth and brynge that swerde."  And Arthur
yede to the swerde, and toke it oute as lyghtly as nothinge hadde
it holden.  Whan the prelates and the comen peple saugh this, thei
ganne to wepe for ioye and pite, and seiden, "Sirs, is ther yet
eny man that seith a-gein this eleccion?"  And the barouns seide,
"Syr, we pray yow that the <CORR SIC="swerde be swerde">swerde be</CORR> suffred yet in the ston to
Passh, but eny man come by that terme that may take it thens;
and ellis we will obbey to this; and yef ye will not suffre so
longe tyme, euery man do the beste he may."  And the
archebisshop seide, "Yef so be he a-bide to Passh, and noon other come
that may parforme this a-uenture, wele ye Than obbey yow to
this eleccion?"  And thei seide alle, "Ye."  Thanne the
archebisshop seide to Arthur, "Sette the swerde a-gein in the ston, for
yef god will, thow shalt not faile of the dignite that he hath the
promysed."  And Arthur did as he comaunded; and ther was
ordeyned to kepe the ston x men and v clerkes; and in this
maner thei bode to Pasch.  And tharchebisshop that hadde take
Arthur in warde, seide, "Wite ye right well ye shall be kynge
and lorde of this peple; now loke that ye be a gode man, and
fro hens-forth cheseth soche men as shull be of youre counseile,
and officers for youre housolde, euen as ye were now kynge, for
so ye shall be with the helpe of god."  And Arthur seide, "I put
me holly in god and in holy cherche, and in youre gode counseile;
therefore chese ye as ye seme be moste to the plesaunce of Ihesu
criste; and I praye yow clepe to yow my lorde my fader."  Than
the archebisshop cleped Antor, and shewde hym the ansuere of
Arthur.  Thanne chose they soche counsellers as thei wolde; and
be counseile of the archebisshop and certein of the barouns, Kay
was made stiwarde.  And of alle other thinges thei a-bode to
Pasch, and than thei assembled alle at logres.


<EPB/><PB N="105" ID="pb.105"/>
</P><P>  Whan thei were alle assembled on the Ester even, the
archebisshop drough hem alle to his paleis, and rehersed
hem the grete wisdom and the gode condiciouns that he fonde in
Arthur.  And the barouns seide, "We will not be a-gein godes
ordenaunce; but it is vnto vs a mervelouse thynge that so yonge
a man, and of so base lyngnage, sholde be lorde and gouernour of
vs alle."  The archebisshop seide, "Ye do not, as cristen men,
thus to be a-gein cristes eleccion."  And they seide, "We be
not ther agein; but ye haue seyn his condiciouns and we ne haue
not don so, and therfore we praye yow to suffre vs to knowe his
condiciouns, and the manere of hys gouernaunce that he will ben
of here-after."  The archebisshop seide, "Will ye thus delaye
his coronacion?"  And thei seide, "We wolde that his sacringe
and coronacion be respite to Penticoste.  <MILESTONE N="35a" UNIT="folio"/>Thus we alle pray and
requere."  And the archebisshop it graunted.  Thus departed
alle the counseile; and on the morowe, whan hight messe was
seide, Arthur yede to the swerde and toke it oute as lightly as
he hadde don be-fore.  Than thei seiden alle that thei wolde
haue hym to their lorde and gouernoure, and thei praide hym to
sette ther the swerde a-gein.  And Arthur ansuerde to the barouns
full debonerly, and seide he wolde do their requeste, or eny
thinge that thei wolde of hym desire.  Thanne they ledde hym
in to the mynster to speke with hym, and to assaye his
condiciouns, and seide, "Sir, we se well that god will that ye be oure
kynge and lorde ouer vs, wherefore we will do to yow oure
homage and of yow holde oure honoures, and we be-seke yow to
respite youre sacringe in to Pentecoste, ne therefore shull ye
nothynge be inteript, but that ye shull be oure lorde and oure
kynge; but to this we praye yow to sey vs what is youre
volunte."  Quod Arthur, "Of that ye sey ye will do to me
youre homages, and holde youre honoures of me, I may it not
receyve, ne I ne ought not to do, ffor I may not to yow ne to
noon other yeve noon honoures till I haue receyued myn; and
ther ye sey ye will that I be lorde of yow and of the reame, that
may not be by-fore that I be sacred and receyved the honoure of
the empere; but the respite that ye desire I it graunte yow with


<EPB/><PB N="106" ID="pb.106"/>

gode will, for I will not be sacred, ne nothinge that ther-to
aperteneth, ne I may not with-outen godes will and youre
volunte."  Thanne seide the barouns a-monge hem-self, "Yef this
childe live he shall be right wise, and wele he hath vs
ansuerde."  And than thei seide, "Sir, vs semeth with youre advice
that ye be crowned and sacred at Pentecoste, and by that terme
we shull obbey to yow at the comaundement of this
archebisshop."  Thanne thei made be brought Iuellis and alle othir
richesse, and yaf it to hym to se whedir he wolde be couetouse
and cacchynge; and whan he hadde alle these yeftes resceyved,
the booke seith he departed it; to knyghtes the stedes, and coursers,
and fresshe robes; and to hem that <CORR SIC="we">were</CORR> Ioly and ennoisies,
he yaf the Iuwellis; and to hem that were auerouse, golde and
siluer; and to sadde wise men he yaf soche thinge as hym dought
sholde hem plese; and with hem he heilde companye, and
enquered in the contre what myght hem beste plese.</P><P>  Thus departed he the yeftes that were yoven hym, for to
knowe of what condicion that he wolde be of.  And whan
thei sawgh hym thus demened, ther was noon but that hym
gretly preysed in theire hertes, and seide that he sholde be of
high renon, and that thei cowde not in hym espie no poynte of
covetise; but as sone as he hadde the grete auers, he be-sette hem
in soche manere, that euery man seide that noon cowde haue do
better, euerych astate and degre.  Thus thei assaide Arthur, and
nought cowde fynde in hym but high vertu and grete
discrecion.  And so thei a-biden to the Witsontide.  And than alle the
baronage assembled at logres, and ther thei assaide a-gein at the
swerde alle that assaie wolde, but neuer was ther founde man that
it myght remeve fro the ston.  And the archebisshop hadde
ordeyned redy the crowne and septre, and all that longed to the
sacringe.  On witson even, be comen counseile of alle the barouns,
the archebisshop made Arthur knyght.  <MILESTONE N="35b" UNIT="folio"/>Alle that nyght dide
he wake in the chief mynster, till on the morowe day.  And
whan it was day, alle the baronye come to the mynster.  The
archebisshop seide, "Sirs, lo here is the man that god hath
chosen to be youre kynge, like as ye haue seyn and knowe.


<EPB/><PB N="107" ID="pb.107"/>

And, lo, here is the crowne and the vestementz rioall, ordeyned by
youre avys and alle the comen assent.  And yet ther be eny of
yow that to this eleccion will not assent, lete hym now sey."  And
they ansuerde and seide, "We acorde that in godes name he be
sacred, and a-noynted with this, that yef ther be eny of vs that
he be with displesed of that we haue be a-geyn his coronacion,
that he pardon vs alle in to this day."  And ther-with thei
kneled alle at ones to Arthur, askynge hym mercy.  And Arthur,
for pite, gan wepe, and seide <CORR SIC="to hem to hem">to hem</CORR>, "That lorde whiche hath
graunted me to haue this honoure, mote yow pardon, and as moche
as in me, I make yow quyte."  And ther-with thei risen vp,
and toke hym by-twene their armes, and ledde hym to the
vestymentz rioall.  And whan he was aried, the archebisshop was
made redy to synge masse, and seide to Arthur, "Now go fecche
the swerde, wher-with ye shull kepe Iustice to deffende holy
cherche, and mayntene right and the cristin feith to youre
power."  And so they yede in procession to the ston.  Thanne
seide the archebisshop to Arthur, "Yef thow wilt swere to god,
and to oure lady seint Marye, and to oure modir holy cherche,
and to seint Petir, and to alle seyntes, to saue and to holde
trouth and pees in the londe, and to thy power kepe trewe
Iustice, com forth and take this swerde, whereby god hath made
the eleccion vpon the."  Whan Arthur herde this, of pite he
gan wepe, and so dide many other.  And he seide, "As verily
as god is lorde ouer alle thynge, so he of his grete mercy graunte
me grace and power this to mayn-tene like as ye haue rehersed,
and I haue it well vndirstonde."  And than he sette hym on his
knees, holdinge vp his hondes, and than toke oute the suerde
lightly with-oute greuaunce, and so bar it vp right.  And thei
ledde hym to the auter, and ther he leide the swerde.  And than
thei hym sacred and a-noynted, and dide that longed to a
kynge.  And after all the seruise was ended, thei yede oute of the
mynstir, and come by the place ther as was the ston; and no
man cowde knowe where it was be-come.  Thus was Arthur
chosen to kynge, and heilde the reame of logres longe in pees.

logres, and seide that thei wolde it no lenger suffre.  And thanne
thei refused the yeftes that the kynge hadde hem offred, and
yoven, and dide hem wele to wite that thei heilde hym not for
ther kynge ne lorde, but that he sholde in all haste voide oute of
the londe and the contree, so that he were no more seyn ther-in;
and yef he wolde not voide the londe, and thei myght hym take,
they lete hym well to wite that ther was no more but he sholde
be deed.  Whan the kynge Arthur vndirstode their manaces, he
yede oute by a wyndowe of karlion, for he douted moche of

treson.  And thus thei soiourned xv dayes in the town, that they
dide noon other forfet on nother side.  And than Merlyn entred
in to the town, and shewde hym-self openly to the peple, as he
that of alle peple wolde be seyn.  And than be-gan in the town
a gret tumulte and a merveilouse, and eueriche man seide, "Lo,
here is Merlin."  Whan the barouns vndirstode that Merlin was
come, they sente after hym; and Merlin come be-fore hem mery
and gladde.  And whan thei saugh hym comynge, thei yede
a-gein hym, and made of hym grete ioye.  Than thei ledde hym
in to a paleise vpon the river with-oute the town, in a faire
medowe, and brought hym vp to a wyndowe a-lofte, where they
myght se faire water, and a grete that yede aboute the wallis of
karlion.</P><P>  When the barouns were come thider, they a-resoned Merlin,
and asked what hym semed of the newe kynge that
the archebisshop hadde crowne with-oute her lycence, and
with-oute assent of the mene people of the londe?  "Trewly,"
quod Merlyn, "thei haue don wele, and, knowe it verily, thei
myght no better haue don."  Than seide the barouns, "Merlin,
how is this that ye sey; ne beth ther many in this reame of
higher astate, and worthier men and wise, that were better
worthi to resceyve that dignyte, than a boy that no man wote
whens he is comen?"  Quod Merlin, "Ye sey as ye liketh; but,
knowe this verily, that he is of more gentill linage, and higher
born that eny of yow; and I do yow to wete that he is nother
sone to Antor, ne brother vnto Kay, that he hath made his
stiwarde, saf only of norture."  The barouns seide, "Merlin, how
is this that ye sey so?  now go ye more oute of reson than ye were
wonte to do."  Quod Merlin, "I shall telle yow what ye shull
do: ye shull sende to the kynge Arthur, that he come in gode
trewis, and Vlfin, the counseiller of Vterpendragon, and Antor,
that hath be with Arthur euer vnto this tyme; and than shall ye
here the trouthe as it is."</P><P>  "Merlin," quod the barouns, "we will do after thi counseile,
and we graunte well that he come and go suerly and
saf, for so moche that thow doste vs prayen.  But who shall

<MILESTONE N="36b" UNIT="folio"/>
go on this message?"  Than thei seide, "Bretel shall go yef
Merlin assente."  "And I graunte well," quod Merlin, "for he
shall well do that is nede."  Than the barouns called Bretell and
charged hym with the massage, and than seide Merlin that
Arthur sholde bringe with hym in his company the
archebisshop.  Than Bretell com to the maister forteresse where as the kynge
was, and seide, "Sir, the barouns haue sente for yow and the
archebisshop, and the bisshop of logres, by gode trewys," and he
seide he wolde with gode will go speke with hem.  Than Bretell
yede to Vlfyn, and seide that Merlin and alle the barouns hadde
sente for hym that he sholde come with-oute lenger
a-bidinge.  When Vlfin herde that Merlin was come, and that he sente for
hym to seche, he was glad and ioyfull, for than he knewe well
that the trouthe of the kynge sholde be knowen.</P><P>  Than yede thei bothe in to the paleis where as the barouns
a-biden, and Vlfin made gret ioye when he saugh Merlin,
and than thei spake to-geder of many thinges; and on the tother
parte come the kynge Arthur and the archebisshop, and Antor that
many day hadde hym tendirly norysshed, and come to the paleis
ther as the barons were a-bidinge after hem; but first hadde
Arthur the kynge put on hym an habergon vndir his robes er he
yede oute of the tour.  And whan he was come be-fore the
barouns, thei fonde moche peple that a-bode to hire what Merlin
wolde sey in audience.  Whan the barouns saugh Arthur comynge,
thei dressed alle hem a-geyn hym for that he was a kynge
a-noynted and sacred, and for love of the archebisshop, that was
a gode man and holy of lyvinge.  And than thei were alle sette
saf, the archebisshop that a-bode stondynge on his feet and seide,
"Sirs, for the reuerence of god, haueth pite of cristen feith that
it be not a-peired thourgh yow, for it were grete damage and
grete shame yef be yow it sholde be distresed, and considereth
that eche of yow is but oon sole man, and as soone shall the
hiest and the richest be deed as the porest creature of this
Citee."  
"Sir," seide the barouns, "a-bide a-while till we haue herde
Merlin speke, for hereafter ye may vs preche at leyser, for Merlin
hath seide to vs a thinge that we haue more merveile of than we

hadde euer be-fore."  Than the archebisshop sat down, and
Merlin a-rose vpon his feet and seide, "Sirs, I haue be-gonne for
to telle yow whos sone was the kynge Arthur, and I do yow to
wite alle that beth here that he was the sone of Vterpendragon,
that hym engendred on Ygerne the same nyght that her lorde
was slayn vpon the brigge, when he issed oute for to assayle the
kynge Vterpendragon.  And on the morowe, whan the kynge
was come a-gein to hys oste, I asked hym that hadde gete on
the duchesse that nyght in rewarde of alle seruises that I hadde
hym don, and he me graunted, that as soone as it were born,
that he wolde make that it sholde be delyuered to me, and of
this he dide me make letteres, and ther-on hanginge his seal,
whiche that Vlfin hath yet in his kepynge in his bailly, and Vlfin
hym-self was at the couenaunt makynge.  After whan the kynge
hadde wedded the quene Ygerne, she wax grete with the childe
that the kynge hadde gete on her, er he hadde here wedded, and
so it fill many tymes that the kynge hir blamed and remembred
diuerse tymes, and seide that the childe that <MILESTONE N="37a" UNIT="folio"/>she was with grete,
was not his, wherefore the quene was shamefaste, and discouerid
to hym the very trouthe, how the childe was be-geten the same
nyght that the Duke was slain, as ye hau herde; and whan the
kynge saugh and knewe that she hadde discouerd to hym the
trouthe as it was, he dide repente that he hadde made hir in
hevynesse ther-of, for he loved hir moche more for her grete
trouthe, and seide, `Dame, seth it is so, that the childe is not
myn in maryage, it were not right that it sholde enherite this
reame, ne be kynge after me, and therfore I comaunde yow, as
derely as ye me love, that as soone as ye be delyuered that ye
make the childe be deliuered to the firste man that ye mete at
the halle dore.'  And the quene dede as he her comaunded, for
she wolde in no manere do nothynge that were to hym eny
displesaunce, and so was the childe deliuered to me the same nyght
that it was born."</P><P>  "Whan I hadde this childe, I yede to the gode knyght
that is here, Antor, and hym I delyuered þe childe,
and praide hym that it sholde be norisshed vp with his wyfes

owne mylke; and so he dide, and put his owne sone, whiche was
not fully of half yere age, to be norisshed vp with a-nother
woman.  And thus is Kay brother to Arthur, as by hys moder
brestes that he dide of sowke, whiche was wif to Antor; for
Vterpendragon hadde hym ther-of tenderly praide be-fore, that
he sholde do to the childe as I sholde hym comaunde; and so he
hath don, god quyte it hym! and dide hym to be baptised, and
cleped his name Arthur; and yet so is his name.  And therefore,
lordynges," seide Merlin, "I se well that god doth not for-yete
his seruaunte, thow he haue be a synner, yef so be that he will be
repentaunte, and hym serue with gode werkes.  And therfore, of
the gode fader and the gode moder oure lorde will yelde rewarde
to the gode seede that of hem issued; for he sente the ston and
the swerde, like as ye haue seyn, to make assay to alle the peple,
who sholde be kynge.  And therfore, knowe it well alle, that it is
very trouthe that I haue yow tolde; and therfore also enquereth
of Antor, that hath hym norisshed."  And than the barouns asked
yef it were so.  And Vlfyn and Antor seide it was trouthe,
with-oute faile.  "And ther-to," quod Vlfin, "se here the
letteres and the seall of Vterpendragon ther-on hanginge, that he
lete make to Merlyn of the couenauntes."  And than the
archebisshop toke the letter, and redde it, herynge alle the peple
euery worde, as Merlyn hadde rehersed to the barouns.  And
whan the peple of the londe herde this merveile, tho many
begonne to wepe, and curse alle tho that were a-geyn the kynge
Arthur.</P><P>  Whan the barouns saugh that, and that the mene peple and
the clergie hilde with Arthur, thei seide thei wolde
neuer haue no bastarde to theire kynge, and many other repreves
and vilonyes thei seide that I will not reherse.  And the
archebisshop seide he sholde be kynge and haue the reame of logres,
who-so-ever ther-to wolde contrarye, seth that it was godes will,
for he wolde hym helpe, and mayntene his londe, and to strengthe
hym in his werre with all his powere.  And whan the
archebisshop and the mene peple saugh the vntrouth of the barouns,
thei heilde all to-geder with oon acorde with kynge Arthur.

<EPB/><PB N="113" ID="pb.113"/>

And the barouns fro thens departed in grete wratthe, and badde
hym to be well ware, <MILESTONE N="37b" UNIT="folio"/>and lete hym wite that thei heilde hym
not for no kynge; and fro hens-forth thei hym deffien and his
helpes.  Than thei yede to theire loggynges, and armed hem,
and made to arme alle theire peple.  And the kynge Arthur yede
a-gein into the maister toure, and dide arme alle his meyne and
his frendes.  And whan thei were alle assembled to-geder, thei
were well vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> on his partye, what of clerkes and of mene peple,
but of knyghtes he hadde but fewe, and of tho that ther were
it were but pore knyghtes; and to hem he yaf hors and harneise,
and money to their exspencis; and were of hem iiij C and l. by
counte, that seide thei wolde hym helpe, to live and dye with hym.</P><P>  Whan the kynge and his peple were armed, and redy dight,
they com to the baill of the toure well arrayde hem to
diffende.  And the barouns, as ye haue herde, were at here
loiginges, to array their peple; and lepen to horsbak, and
assembled in the town euerych at his baner, and were well viij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>
knyghtes, with-outen seriantz and arblastis, and fotemen grete
plente.  And whan thei were alle assembled, the barouns asked
yef thei sholde go assaile the paleise ther the kynge was?  And
somme ther-to dide acorde, and somme seide that thei wolde ley
siege environ the baile, and shet hem with-ynne, that thei sholde
neuer be so hardy to ysse out of the toure.  And as thei spake
thus, com Merlin to hem, and seide, "Sirs, what is that ye
purpose to do?  Y do yow to wite ye will gete youre-self the

he returned a-noon a-gein to kynge Arthur, and bad hym he
sholde nothinge be dismaied, for he sholde not drede hem alle;
ffor he wolde hym helpe so that the moste hardy of hem in the

the archebisshop and Antor and Kay and Vlfyn and Bretell, these
vij were prevely in counseile.  And than seide Arthur to Merlin,</P><P>  "Dere frende Merlin, I haue herde say that ye loved well
my fader, Vterpendragon, as longe as he was lyuinge,

departed.  And the archebisshop wente vpon the walles
on high, and the kynge Arthur dide his peple make hem redy
and lepe on horse, and in that maner-wise thei a-bide longe

spere, and be semblaunce he caste oute of his mouth fire and
flame, and he hadde a grete taile and a longe.  This dragon no
man cowde wite where Merlin it hadde, and it was merveilouse
light and mevable; and whan it was set on a launce thei
beheilde it for grete merveile.  Than toke the kynge the dragon,
and yaf it to Kay, his stiwarde, in soche forwarde that he be
chef banerer of the reame of logres euer while his lif doth
dure.  Thus arraied thys mayne the kynge Arthur, and a-bode in soche
maner on horsbak be-fore the yate be-fore the paleis, and the barouns
made picche her teynte and pavelouns thourgh the medowes
that were large and faire.  And whan the archebisshop that
saugh, he asked what thei were come to seche so armed; and
thei seide that thei were come to take the maister toure, which
thei wolde no man sholde be Inne but by hem.</P><P>  Than the archebisshop yaf the scentence full dolerouse, and
cursed of god and with all his power alle tho that in
the londe dide eny forfet, or were a-gein the kynge Arthur.  And
the barons seide that for eny cursinge thei wolde not cesse till
thei hadde dryve the kynge oute of the londe; and yef thei
myght hym take, thei lete hym knowe that he sholde not escape
with-oute the deth.  And whanne Merlin vndirstode their
bobaunce, he caste his enchauntement, so that alle their logges
and pavilouns were alle on fire a-flame.  And thei ther-of were
so a-baisshed that hem dought longe er thei myght gete out in to
the medowes fro the fyre; but er thei myght come ther, thei
caught grete harme, and foule were thei skorched with the

them!"  And thei spronge oute at the yate, as moche as theire
horse myght renne, the speres on their asseles, theire sheldes
be-fore her bristes.  And thei were so a-baisshed and affraide that
the moste hardy of hem wolde fain haue be thens; ffor thei
wende not that ther hadde be so moche peple with-Inne; for thei
with-oute were sodenly many of hem born down with speres,
and moche peple slain; ffor thei were so astoned with the hete of
the fier that theire deffence was but symple.  There was grete

<EPB/><PB N="117" ID="pb.117"/>

slaughter of men and horse.  Ther dide Arthur merveillouse
dedes of armes, that gretly he was be-holden, bothe on that
oon part and on the tother; he ouerthrewe knyghtes, bothe
horse and man, with stroke of spere and of swerde.  And ther-to
hadde the princes and barouns grete enuye, and assembled hem
to-geder, and seide that it were grete shame yef he so
escaped.  And thei were noble knyghtes and hardy, and full of high
prowesse, and many of hem carnell frendes.  Than seyde kynge
Ventres of garlot that he wolde hem delyuere in short tyme, for
yef Arthur oonly were deed, the werre of the remenaunt were
soone fynysshed.  "Goth on," seide the othir prynces, "and <MILESTONE N="39a" UNIT="folio"/>yef
ye haue myster we shall yow socoure."  Ther-with departed the
kynge Ventres and his company, that was a moche man of body,
and a gode knyght and yonge, of prime barbe; and he was
mervelouse stronge, and he helde a shorte grete growen spere, sharp
grounden, and rode agein Arthur.</P><P>  Whan Arthur saugh hym come, he dressed a-gein hym his
horse hede, and griped a grete aisshen spere, the heede
sharp trenchaunt of stiell; than smote the horse with the spores,
that it ran so faste and so briaunt, that alle hadden merveile that
it be-helden.  And he afficched hym so in the sturopes that the
horse bakke bente, and smote to-geder so hetely vpon the sheldes
that thei preced thourgh.  The kynge Ventres brake his spere
vpon kynge Arthur, and Arthur smot hym a-gein so sore that he
bar hym ouer the horse croupe, and his legges vp-right, that the
erthe rebounded, but he hadde noon other hurte.  And whan the
kynge loth of Orkanye saugh the kynge Ventres ouerthrowen, he
was wroth and sorowfull, for thei were bothe cosin germains,
and also thei hadde wedded two sustres.  Than smote he the
horse with spores a-gein Arthur, that yet hadde he his spere
hoill.  And whan he saugh the comynge of kynge loth, he come a-gein
with grete hardinesse, as he that of hym hadde no dowte; and
mette to-geder on the sheldis, so that the horse ne myght not
passe ferther till the tymbres were broken; and on the passinge
forth thei hurtelid to-geder so fiercely, with sheldes and with her
beyes and her helmes, that the kynge loth was so astonyed that


<EPB/><PB N="118" ID="pb.118"/>

he fley ouer his horse crowpe.  Than a-roos grete noyse and cry
on the oon part and the tother.  Ther be-gan a grete stoure and
merveillouse.  The knyghtes that were with kynge Ventres
peyned hem sore to socoure their lorde, and so dide the knyghtes
of kynge loth; and Arthurs knyghtes peyned hem sore to helpe
Arthur, and to take and holde these other two kynges.  And so
be-gan the medle on bothe parteis crewell and fellenouse.  But
with grete peyne were these two kynges rescowed and horsed
a-gein.  Whan Arthur was releved, he drowgh his swerde oute of
skabrek, whiche was so cler and bright shynynge as thei semed
that it be helden that it glistred as it hadde be the brightnesse of
xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> tapres brennynge.  And it was the same swerde that he
toke oute of the ston; and the letteres that were write on the
swerde seide that the right name was cleped Escaliboure, whiche
is a name in ebrewe, that is to sey in englissh, kyttynge, Iren,
tymber, and steill; and the letteres seide trewe, as ye shall
heeren here-after.  whan the kynge Arthur hadde drawen oute
his swerde, he smote in to the prese, ther as he saugh thikkeste,
and smote a knyght on the sholder, so that he made it discendir
from the body; the stroke was grete and the swerde trenchaunt,
so that he slyt a-sonder the sadell and the chyne of the horse, that
bothe the knyght and the horse fill on an hepe.  And than he
smote a-boute hym grete strokes bothe on the lefte syde and on
the right side, and made so grete occision a-boute hym that all
that it syen helde it grete merveile, <MILESTONE N="39b" UNIT="folio"/>and ne durste not a-bide his
strokes, but made wey and voided place for drede of his swerde
and of his fell strokes.</P><P>  Whan the vij kynges saugh the damage and the grete losse
that they hadde thourgh hym, thei were wroth and
right sorowfull, and seyde eche to other, "Now let vs alle sette
on hym attones, and bere hym down to the erthe, for elles may
we nothynge conquere;" and to this thei acorded.  Than thei
henten speres grete and rude, and ronnen a-gein hym with as
grete ranndon as their horse myght hem bere, and smyten hym
on the shelde and on the haubrek, but is so stronge and sure that
no mayle ne perced; but thei bar to hym so harde that Arthur


<EPB/><PB N="119" ID="pb.119"/>

was throwe to the erthe, bothe he and his horse on oon
hepe.  And whan Kay and Antor and Vlfin and Bretell, and other of
Arthurs frendes syen this, Antor hasted hym to kynge Carados,
and met hym so hedylyche with a grete spere, that bothe the
tymbir and stelen heede shewed thourgh his shuldre, and threwe
bothe hym and his horse to the erthe, and lay longe in
swowne.  And Vlfyn and kynge Ventres of Garlot mette so sore to-geder,
that ether bar other to the grounde, and the horse vpon
hem.  And the kyge ydiers and bretell brake their spers that oon vpon
the tother, with-oute more harme doynge.  And alle the tother
barouns a-bode vpon the kynge Arthur, that yet lay at the erthe
all stonyed, and thei smote on his helme grete storkes and pesaunt,
so that thei made hym moche more astonyd.  And whan Kay
saugh that the kynge was at so grete myschef, he griped his
swerde, and come ther the kynge was ouer-throwen, and smote

bothe on the oon and on the tother.  Ther was grete bataile, and
stronge stour, and grete slaughter, bothe of men and horse; and
so peyned thei that were with kynge Arthur, that thei haue
hym remounted on his horse; but firste hadde thei grete payne

alle the commons hasted thider all that myghten, and seiden that
thei wolden alle be deed on the same grounde, er that kynge
Arthur hadde eny greef, as longe as thei myghten hym

many thei dide sle and wounde, and so put hem to flight, whether
they wolde or noon.  And so thei yede <CORR SIC="discounfite">discounfited</CORR>, but thei

but the horse bar hym to faste, so that the stroke descended on
the horse and slyt hym euen a-sondre be-hynde the sadill, and

were gretely affraied leste he hadde be slain, and returned hym
to rescowe, ther be-gan the stour grete and merveillouse, for that
oon part peyned to with-holde and to take kynge ydiers, and on
the to-ther syde thei peyned hym to rescowe, and so was ther do
more damage and harme than hadde be all the day be-fore, ffor
ther was neyther horse ne man that myght endure agein the

blody of brain and blode so that his armes were so steyned that
nought was seid but all reade.  Neuertheless, so peyned ydiers

thei departed discounfited, and the chase lasted longe tyme, and
so the vij kynges losten I-nough, for of all the harneys that thei
hade brought thider, thei hadde not with hem the valew of ijd,
that all ne was brente with the fier that Merlin made discende
amonge theire tentes and pauelouns, saf only the vessels of golde

returned to Cardoell, in Walis, whan he hadde be at Karlion,
and sente after sowderes ouer all, and yaf hem wagis, and horse,
and harneyse, and robes, and so he be-come in grete love a-monge
the pore knyghtes of the contree, so that thei assured hym and
sworn that thei wolde hym neuer fayle while their lives endured.
After this that Arthur hadde so don that hadde gete the hertes
of moche peple.  Than he stuffed his castelles, and townes, and
Citees, and after heilde courte at logres, his chief Citee, that now

that thei myght hem well mayntene and gouerne.  And so the
kynge gate hym grete love, so that fro thens-forth thei dide hym
neuer faile for no drede of deth.  And so hadde he of his peple
grete socoure and helpe, as ye shull here her-after.</P><P>  After this that the kynge hadde made CCC knyghtes, as the
story reherseth, and that he hadde stuffed alle his
castelles with soche men as that Merlyn hadde yoven hym counseile,
than Merlin toke hym in counseile, and seide—but at the
counseile was Vlfyn, that right moche hym loved.  And Merlyn
seide, "Sir, I knowe a thinge that I will shewe to yow, and
telle yow my customes; this is the trouthe:—<MILESTONE N="40b" UNIT="folio"/>Ther is a man in
Northumbirlonde, whiche is an hermyte, in the moste wilde place

and how she was ledde to be brente for a blame that was put
vpon hir; and how Vortiger dide hym seche for his tour; and
his moder was a nonne in an abbey where as he her lefte; and
how the tour dide holde that Vortiger lete make; and the
significacion of the two dragouns, how that oon dide sle the tother;
and how after the deth of Vortiger how he was a-queynted with
Pendragon and Vter, and of the grete bataile where as
Pendragon was slayn; and after how he was with his broder
Vterpendragon, and how he made hym to ly with the duchesse Ygerne
in the castell of Tintagell; and how he made the kynge in
semblaunce of the duke hir husbonde, whan Arthur was be-geten;
and how that Vlfyn devised the mariage of Vterpendragon and
the quene youre moder, whiche hadde v doughteres by the Duke,
hir husbonde, and two by hir firste husbonde; wherof the kynge
loth hath oon doughter to his wyf, and the kynge Ventres of

whiche lerneth wele, and is right wise and connynge in grete
clergie.  And wite well that the kynge loth hath v sones by
his wif, of whiche thow didest engendre that oon at logres whan
thow were a squyer.  And alle thei be feire yonge squyres, and
the eldest hight Gawein.  And wite thow well that he shall be
the trewest knyght of all the worlde a-gein his lorde; also he
shall be oon of the beste knyghtes of the worlde, and moste
shall the love while his lif doth endure, and shall the helpe agein

obbeye to the; where thourgh thow shalt ouer-come thyn
enmyes, and also be the helpe of his brothern, whiche shull be
so noble knyghtes.  And the kynge Ventres of Garlot, that is so
gode a knyght, hath a-nother sone by his wif that is thy suster
also; and he is a fayre yonge squyre, and is I-cleped
Galeshyn.  And kynge Vrien hath a-nother that hight Ewein le gaunte, that

well that thei shull neuer be dubbed of no man till thow a-dubbe
hem and yeve hem armes.  Thise shull make the a-queynted with
many a gentilman that ben of high lynage, that for love of hem
and of her company shull the serue as longe as thei shall

which ought to be thy men; and they haue wedded two sustres
to their wyfes, and owen to holden their londes of the; and thei
be men of high lynage, and be bretheren germain.  These two
bretheren shull haue sones whiche shull be merveilouse <MILESTONE N="41a" UNIT="folio"/>gode

oon of these two kynges is cleped the kynge Ban of Benoyk, and
the tother is cleped the kynge Bors of Gannes.  But thei haue an
euell neighbour that marched nygh to theire remes, and he is a
kynge, and werreth vpon hem, and shall yet here-after do hem
grete peyne and traueyle for enuye; and for that he may not

theire debonertee, for thei be full worthy men and right
trewe.  And therfore, loke thow, a-queynte the with hem, and offre hem
thy servyse, and thei shull conne the grete thanke, and thei
shull do to the homage full gladly; and when thi courte shall
departe, telle to hem thi counseile, and sey how thow wilte go in
to Carmalide, to serve the kynge leodogan; and therfore lede
hem with the, for thei be full noble knyghtes, and full of
merveilouse high prowesse; and thow shall haue to hem grete
mystere at thy repeyre a-geyn in to this londe, for thyn enmyes
wolde deffende the fro the londe; but ther-to shall thei not

shull be in thy company.  And I will well that thow wite
my condiciouns be, that I gladly repeire in to forestes and
wildernesse, by the nature of hym that me be-gat, for he loveth not to
haue the company that is of godes be-halue; But I ne go not for
his sake, but for the love of Blase, the holy hermyte.  And
knowe it verily that in every nede that thow haste, I shall
redily be with the, to helpe the and counseile; but ofte tymes
shalt thow se me in other semblaunce than thow doste now,
for I will not that alle peple knowe me whan I speke with
hem, or whan I speke with the; but I will that thow
swere that thow shall not me discouer to no man of thynge
that I sey to the, ffor yef thow me discure thow shalt haue
therby more damage than thow woldest trowe."  And the
kynge Arthur swhore to hym with gode will, like as he dide
devyse, as he that was full ioyfull to haue his a-queytaunce and
companye, and seide that neuer wolde he sey, ne do nothynge
that sholde to hym displese by his power.  And than Merlin
hym assured of his londe, and seide he wolde helpe hym so well
that he wolde deserue of hym grete thanke.

<EPB/><PB N="124" ID="pb.124"/>
</P><P>  Thus Arthur sente Vlfin and Bretell for kynge ban and kynge
bors, hys brother, and sente hem worde that as dere <CORR SIC="a">as</CORR>
thei hym loved, to come to hym to logres in grete Breteyne, at
the feste of halowmasse; ffor these two knyghtes were well
a-queynted with these two kynges that thei wente to seche, for
moche thei to-geder loveden, and well were aqueynted in the tyme
of Vterpendragon.  And thei passed ouer the see, <MILESTONE N="41b" UNIT="folio"/>and come in to
litill Breteyne, and com thourgh the londe that was all wasted; and
they fonde many townes brente and distroied.  And so they come
to a Citee that was cleped Beynoyk, that now is cleped Burges in
barre, and be-longinge to kynge Claudas de la deserte.</P><P>  This kynge Claudas of whom I speke claymeth a Castell that
the kynge Ban hath closeth in his londe.  And Claudas
seide that the londe was his, and the kynge Ban seide, "Nay."
And so be-gan the werre be-twene hem, grete and merveilouse,
and longe endured the mortall hate be-twene hem, as longe as
thir life dured.  And so Claudas ran thourgh the lodes of
kynge ban er he hadde hym warned, and so he dide hym grete
damage of prisoners that he toke in the Contree, and in townes
that he fonde vn-walled, whiche he brente and distroied, and
made grete slaughter of his peple, as he that was with-oute
pitee, of that he myght haue the hier honde.  But to the Castell
that kynge ban hadde do closed, myght he nothinge do, for it
was right stronge.  This castell hadde kynge ban well stuffeth
with men of werre, and in the maister forteresse hadde he sette
<CORR SIC="a">at</CORR> Castelein, a right noble man and a trewe, that was cleped
Grascien, and made his compere a godsone of hys, that he hadden
houe fro the fontstone, and was cleped after the kynge ban
Bawdewyn, whiche was after full renomede, and full of grete
prowesse in the reame of logres, and in many other contrees,
where as he dide many grete dedes of armes, of whiche is yet
made no mencion, till that my mater com ther-to.  But speketh
of kynge ban, that was sorowfull and wroth for the damage that
kynge Claudas hadde hym don with-oute diffyinge.  And than he
assembled his power, and yede hym a-geyns in all the haste that
he myght, at a passage that he sholde come by.


<EPB/><PB N="125" ID="pb.125"/>
</P><P>  When thise two hostes sholde mete ther was right grete
bataile, and stronge stour, and grete slaughter on both
partyes, for the kynge ban slough so many with his owne honde
that the hepes lay in the feilde as it hadde be dede swyne or
shepe.  And so bar hym the kynge ban and his peple that the
kynge claudas was putt to flight, and loste all his harneyse and his
praye, and the prisoners that they hadde taken were rescowed.  And
on that othir syde, on that side that marched to gawnes, the kynge
bors and his men entred and brente and distroide the londes of
the kynge Claudas euen to the yates of his chief Citee that
cleped la deserte, and toke alle the prisoners that he
myght.  And so he distroied all as he wente thourgh the contre, that
with-ynne lx myle ye sholde not fynde an house in to herberowe
but it were in roches or in seleres vnder erthe, but other
habitacion sholde ye noon fynde.  And so was Claudas made pore and
maat.  And by that distruxion Claudas heilde hym <MILESTONE N="42a" UNIT="folio"/>so coy that
he druste not werre no more in theire londes longe tyme after; and
after that he greved the two brethern more than thei dide hym,
as ye shull here her-after.  And so the messagers of Arthur
fonde the contree distroied like as ye haue herde; and thei
merveiled gretly how this myght be.  And thei rode forth till thei
come to Trebes, the castell that the kynge ban hadde do closed,
whiche was right stronge, and stode on a high grounde.</P><P>  In this castell was the quene Elein, the wyf of kynge ban of
Benoyk, which was a gode lady and of holy
livynge.  And ther-to she was of wonder grete bewte, so that noon was
founden feirer in no contre; and ther-to was she yonge, of the
age of xvj yere, and hadde be but litill while be-fore be maried
to the kynge Ban.  And the kynge Boors hadde wedded the
to-ther suster, that was a gode lady and gentell, and was the
yongest of the two quenes.  And whan Vlfin and Bertell come to
Trebes, thei axed after the kynge Ban; and the peple seide he
was at parlament with his brother kynge Boors of Benoyk.  And
whan thei vndirstode this, thei toke leve of the quene Elein and
departed fro thens all armed, for the contre that thei sholde passe
thourgh was not sure, for men of werre that ran thourgh the


<EPB/><PB N="126" ID="pb.126"/>

londe.  And more thei wolde haue don, but for drede of the two
brethern that were kynges.  And thei kepten streite Iustice, ffor
alle tho that myght be take with eny forfet or robbery, thei
were a-noon putte to Iustyse and distroide with-oute
respite.  Whan these two messagers departed fro Trebes a five mile, thei
saugh vij knyghtes of Claudas, men that repayreden thourgh the
Contree to assaye yef thei myght ought wynne vpon the kynge
bors or on the kynge Ban; but the contre was so voyde that
they fonde nought to take, ffor the peple were fledde to stronge
Citees and to stronge Castelles with all that thei hadden.  Whan
the two massagers saugh the vij knyghtes, than seide oon to
a-nother of he vij, "See yonder two knyghtes, be-holde whiche
horse thei ride; grete foles were we yef we sholde lete hem thus
passe!"  Than seide oon, "It semeth well that thei be not of
this contree, for thei bere not the armes of this londe ne as
knyghtes of this reame."  "Trewly," quod oon of hem,
"what-so-euer thei be, they seme to be worthy men, bothe by their
armes and by theyr horses; and yef thei be in seruise, it sheweth
well that they serue a gode lorde."  "What forse," quod
a-nother, "what-euer thei be, lete vs go take from hem
theire horse and theire harneys, for ther-to haue we grete nede."
Anoon oon of hem smote the horse with the spores, and ran
cryinge after these messagers, and seide, "Sirs!  ne passe no
ferther, for yef ye do ye be but deed, yef ye be longynge to the
kynge Ban or to the kynge Boors; but and yef ye be with the
kynge Claudas, than haue ye no drede; for we kepe the weyes
and the passages of this marche, that noon ne a-scape that is
a-gein Claudas.  And therfore we aske of yow the trewage, after
the custom that we vse; for wite it well yow be-houeth to leve
with vs youre horse and youre armes, and ye ascape, so ye may
conne vs grete thanke; but for that vs semeth that ye <MILESTONE N="42b" UNIT="folio"/>worthy
men, we lete yow passe a-lyve with-oute inprisonment, with this
raunsom, to lese youre horse and youre harneyse."  Whan Vlfyn
vndirstode his manasynge, he seide, "Sir knyght, ne haste not to
sore, for yet thow may come all be tyme.  I knowe nought what
thow arte, but thow arte a bolde speker, and also a grete a-vauntour;<EPB/><PB N="127" ID="pb.127"/>
 and ille happe haue he that vylenis knyght that asketh
eny tribute of eny trauellynge knyghtes; and thow arte nothynge

thow hem gete, thei shull be right dere solde."  And when
Bretel vndirstode how Vlfin spake to the knyght, he seide, "Sir
<CORR SIC="kynght">knyght</CORR>, in euyll tyme hast thou asked vs tribute."  Than smote
he the horse with the spores ageyn hym, and that other knyght
com hym a-gein, gripynge his spere in the fewtre.  And thei
smeten to-geder vpon the sheldes so sore that they perced thourgh,
and the spere heede of the knyght stynte on Breteles
haubrek.  And Bretell smote hym a-gein, that with so grete ravayn that the
spere ran thourgh his left sholder that the heed shewede a span
be-hynde.  And he bar on hym so sore that he threwe the knyght
to grounde, and his horse vpon hym.  And he swowned for
the grete anguyssh that he felte.  And Bretell drowgh oute a-gein
his spere that yet was hool.  And than seide he to the knyght in
scorne, "Sir knyght, now maist thow loigge here be leyser, and
kepe these weyes, that noon ne ascape with-oute paiynge of
trewage."  And than he rode a walop after Vlfyn, gripynge his
spere.  And Vlfin saugh wele the Iustynge of hym and of the
knyght, and ther-of he was gladde, and moche he preysed
Bretell.  And whan thei were come to-geder, thei rode fourth a
softe paas.  Whan the vj knyghtes saugh theire lorde
ouerthrowen and wounded, thei were sorowfull, and seide that neuer
sholde thei be gladde er thei were a-venged.  Than two of hem
renged hem, and priked after the messagers as faste as the horse
myght hem bere.  And whan thei approched, thei ascryde hem,
and manaced hem crewelly.  And whan the messagers saugh
hem two a-gein two, they returned her hedes, and bowed vnder
theire sheldes as thei that were gode knyghtes and sure.  And
they mette to-geder alle foure, with alle theire myght of horse
and man, and smyte to-geder with sperres in the sheldes, so that
thei fley on peces.  And Bretell bar his spere so high that he


<EPB/><PB N="128" ID="pb.128"/>

smote his felow a-bove the shilde, that the haubrek rente, so that
he sente the hede and the shafte thourgh his throte, and so he
fill to grounde vp-right.  And Vlfyn hitte so his felowe thourgh
shelde and haubreke, that the spere hede wente thourgh the lyfte
sholder, that he fill to the erthe ouer his horse crowpe.</P><P>  After this made them redy two of the tother foure for to
ouer-take them that hadde theire felowes slayn.  They
ascryde the two messagers, and seide that thei sholde dye for
thei wolde a-venge theire felowes at hir power.  And whan they
saugh hem come, thei turned the hedes of theire horse, and that
oon requyred <MILESTONE N="43a" UNIT="folio"/>the tother to do well.  And than thei mette
to-geder in a valey, and Vlfyn lete renne to hym that com a-gein
hym, and Bretell a-gein the tother.  The two knyghtes brake theire
speres vpon the two massagers; and Bretell smote so his felowe
that he slyt ther shilde and the haubrek to rente, that the spere
yede thourgh the body, and bar hym to grounde all blody and
deed.  And Vlfyn smote his felowe so sore that he fill to the
erthe, and his horse on his body, and in the fallynge he brake
his nekke.  Than seide Bretell to hem, "Sirs, now may ye
manace vs, and ther-to I yeve yow leve to kepe the weyes and
the passages."  At these wordes lowgh Vlfin for merthe.  Than
yede these two massagers forth theire wey, and trauaylde forth
all the day wery, and for the traueile of the bataile that thei
hadde agein the knyghtes, so that by euen thei come to Benoyk,
where thei fonde grete plente of peple; ffor the kynge ban
hadde sente for the kynge Boors his brother, and hys barouns with
hym, that moste were of his counseile.  The two messagers rode
thourgh the town, till thei come to the maister paleise, and ther
thei a-lighten, and toke theire horse and their armes to a squyre
to kepe, that thei hadde brought with hem with-oute mo
meyne.  Than yede thei vp in to the paleise, and asked after kynge Ban
and his brother the kynge Boors.  And it was tolde hem how they
were in a chamber in counseile soole <CORR SIC="by by">by</CORR> hem-self.  And than
were the messagers gladde that thei hadde hem founden so

to-geder.  And thei a-bode till that the two kynges hadde made
ende of her counseile.  And as they a-bode so, com to hem a
knyght that highte Leones, and brought with hym a knyght that
he moche loved, and his name was Pharien.  Thise tweyne come
to the messagers, and hem asked what thei were, and thei
ansuerde that thei sholde sone knowe, yef it plesed hem to a-byde
so longe till thei hadde seide theire message to the two
kynges.  And when these other herde hem so sey, thei a-vised hem better,
and knewe hem wele.  And than thei toke hem in armes, and
made hem grete ioye, as thei that longe tyme had to-geder loved
from theire childehode.  And than thei asked yef thei hadde
grete haste; and thei ansuerde, "Ye, right grete."  Than thei
toke them be the hande, and ledde hem in to the chamber where
the two kynges weren, and whan the two kynges hem saugh,
thei yede hem a-geins, for thei knewe well, that soone after
sholde they here tydynges, and Leonces a-resonde hem, and seide
to the two brethern, and seide, "Lo, here two messagers of the
grete Breteyne that beth come to speke with yow."  And the
kynges seide they were welcome; and than thei made of hem
grete ioye, as thei that moche hem loved, and than thei seeten
down, and than the kynge ban asked what nede hadde brought
hem in to that contre, for with-outen cause ye be not come hider;
and after he axed of tydinges of the londe that thei come fro,
and yef the barons hadde yet a kynge after her in-tente, for well
knewe thei of the stryfe and of the eleccion, and how the swerde
and the ston that apered on the feeste of yoole be-fore the

the grete damage that Merlin dide hem with the fire, and how
grete merveiles of armes the yonge kynge dide; and after thei
seide their message, how Arthur hadde sente hem to seche, be the
counseile of Merlin, and whan they hadde seide all their message
fro the be-gynynge to the ende, Vlfin praide hem to take here
counseile, and to yeve hem ansuere hastely, for the terme was

were kynges seide that they were greved gretly with a werre,
that they hadde agein the kynge Claudas, "and  therfore we drede
<DEL>when</DEL>whan   we be oute of the Contree, that they falle not vpon vs, for

"that ne wolde we not, but Merlin sente yow worde, that ye

Messagers the thei sholde meve the thirde day, and thei hem thanked
with gode herte.  Than thei made hem to vn-arme hem, for the
kynge ban wolde not haue at noon other osteill, but in his

they were assailed by vij knyghtes, and all as it was  be-falle, as
ye haue herde be-fore, "and," quod they, "thanked be god we
haue do so that we beth now here."  And whan the two kynges
herde that they were so delyuered fro the vij knyghtes, they
praysed hem gretly, neuertheles they knewe wele that they were
worthy knyghtes, and gode men and trewe.  Than made the
kynge Ban the messagers to be sette, and serued with riche
seruyse and deynte metes, as he that wele cowde it do, and
Leonces and Pharien moche peyned hem to serue and make chere,
for longe hadde thei be aqueynted to-geder in the grete Breteyne
in the tyme of Vterpendragon.  A-noon kynge Ban and his brother
arayed hem to move the thirde day, and Comaunded theire londes

the kynge ban toke gode tokenes that they sholde sende to the
barouns of the londe, yef nede were, and the tokene was a rygne
of hys fynger, that who-so brought hem that rynge they sholde
yeve credence to the message that it brought.  And than thei
departed, and sped so here Iourneys that thei com to the see, <MILESTONE N="44a" UNIT="folio"/>and entred in to the shippes, and passed ouer with-oute eny

for he knewe well whiche were gode and trewe, and he wiste
also whiche were with-oute treson.  And whan all this was don,
Merlin come to hym and seide, "Sir, be gladde and mery, for

and some ther were that threw other to the erthe, and some

that kay hadde the prys and the wurship of the turnemente on
that oon part, and on that other part Gifflet and Lucas, the
boteller; and the beste after hem, was Marke de la roche, and
Guynas le Bleys, and drias de la foreste sauge, and Belyas, the
amerouse, of maydens castell, and Blyos de la casse, and Madyens
le crespes, and Flaundryns le blanke, and Grassien, the castelein,
and Placidas le gays: these dide so well whan thei come to the
turnement, that noon myght agein hem endure; but after that
the felowes of the reame of benoyk dide so wele, that they made
all the turnement resorte bak to theire firste place, for the
felisship of the table of Logres were gon oute for to chaunge helmes,
that weren to hewen and rente; and whan thei saugh theire
party turned to disconfiture, thei hem hasted and henten speres,
and come in to the turnemente as faste the horse myght hem
bere, and smote in a-monge the grettest presse, and kay cam
before alle his felowes as he that was desirouse to shewe his
knyght-hode, and griped a grete growen spere, and he was a
merveillouse gode knyght, yef he ne hadde not be so full of

after refuseden to go in his felisshep to seche a-uentures in the

reherse here-afterwarde.  This tecche hadde kay take in his norice
that he dide of sowke, ffor he hadde it nothynge of norture of his

but of what kay seide, his felowes that knewe his costomes ne
rought neuer, but he was full of myrthe and Iapes in his speche,
for seide it for noon euyll will of no man, and ther at lough thei
gladly that knewe his maners, and on that othir syde he was oon
of the beste felowes and myriest that myght be founde.  Whan
he was come to the turnement, as ye haue herde, he mette with
Lydonas, that wele hadde do all the day, and moche he and his
felowes peyned to dryve hem of Logres oute of the feilde, and so
thei were nygh at disconfiture.  And whan kay saugh this he
was sory and wroth.  Than he smote in to the presse, and mette
lydonas in the shelde so sore that he perced thourgh-oute, and
the spere poynte stynte oute at the haubrek, and he shof so
harde, that he caste hym to the grounde vp-right; and with the
same course he smote Grascien, of Trebes, that he ouerthrewe
hym and his horse.  Than he leyde honde to his swerde, and
cride Clarence, the signe of kynge Arthur; and they be-heilde
hym, and saugh the socour that he brought, for they wende they
hadde all loste.  Than they returned, and be-gonne to do so well
that they hadde not do so well all the day be-fore.</P><P>  This Iustynge that Kay hadde don saugh well the kynge
Arthur, and the kynge ban and the kynge Boors, his
brother, and they preysed moche kay, and seide he was wight
and deliuere, and thei be-heilde hym gladly.  And whan Lucas,
the botyller, saugh kay hadde don so well, he smote the horse
the spores in to the grettest presse, and smote Blios so harde that
he fill to the grounde, and the spere fly on peses.  Than he pulde
oute hys swerde and spronge in a-monge hem, and be-gan to yeve
grete strokes and to do so well, that moche he was preysed, and
so be-gan the turnement newe to enforse for the rescewe of theire
felowes.  Than com Gifflet freschely armed, his spere in fewtre,
as faste as his horse myght hym bere, and saugh Blioberes and
two of hys felowes that leyde on kay, the stiwarde, with here
swerdes, and heilde hym so shorte that he hadde grete nede of
helpe, for thei were thre and he was but alone, and also they
were thre the beste of all the turnement, and Placidas hadde hitte
kay on the helme, that he lened on his sadill bowe; and whan

<EPB/><PB N="137" ID="pb.137"/>

Gifflet sye this he for-thought it sore, and he smote blioberis so
harde, that he fill to the erthe, bothe he and his horse, and the
spere fly on peces, and leide honde to his swerde, and smote
Placidas on the helme that he bowed ouer the arson of his sadell,
and after leyde on hym so grete strokes, that he was so astooned
that he fill to the erthe vp-right, and kay hym dressed, <MILESTONE N="46a" UNIT="folio"/>that
grete nede hadde of that socoure, and after be-heilde and knew
that it was Gyfflet that so hadde hym delyuered, and thought to
quyte hym that bountee yef he myght; and so he dide
withynne shorte tyme, as ye shall heren heir-after, and for that thei
felishiped first to-geder, and woued well to-geder longe tyme after
of grete love alle the dayes of her lyf.  Whan Gifflet hadde
<CORR SIC="delyued">delyuered</CORR> kay, as ye haue herde, he loked a-boute hym and saugh
Ieroas, that moche hadde greved in that stour; than he griped
his swerde and ran vpon hym for ire, and yaf soche a stroke that
the fire fley oute, and ther-with he kytte a pece of his helme, and
but the swerde hadde swarved, he hadde ben deed for
euer-more.  The stroke descended vpon the lifte sholder, that he fill to the
erthe all blody.  Than arose the noyse and the crye, for well
wende thei that this syen that he hadde be deed with-oute
recouer.  Than come his felowes to the rescowe, and on that other parte
com the felowes of kay, the stywarde.  Than be-gan the medle
grete and hidouse, that many were wounded and ouerthrowen er
that other was rescowed and sette on horse; and the fyve felowes
that were be-fore rehersed, whan thei saugh the medle so be-gonne,
thei smot so v of the first that thei metten that thei blushit to

well, that all hadde merveile how they myght it suffre or
endure.  Ther be-gan a-gayn the turnement on bothe partyes, and well thei
dide in armes on that oon part and that other, Till it drough
towarde evenesonge, that the thre kynges descended from the paleise
and com in to the place where as was the turnement, and saugh
that thei heilde hem euen like, that noon ne wiste wele whiche
hadde the better.  Than com the thre kynges, and hem departed
and seide it was tyme to cesse, for it was to late eny more to

were they hurte; and the kynges yede to here euesonge, and than
thei yede to soper, and after begonne the carolles and to speke
of the turnemente, and asked oon of a-nother, how hem semed
of whom that hadde don beste.  And thei seide that the kynge
ban hadde xv knyghtes that hadde don alther beste more than
eny other, and on that other part were viij that hadde don
merveiles in armes, and gretly hadde they traueylled and peyned,
and moche were thei to a-lowe.  Thus heilde they here tales
longe, and alwey they yaf the loos and the pris to kay, the
stiward, and to Lucas, the boteller, and to Gifflet, the sone of

and in euery nede were redy.</P><P>  Whan the tables were vp, arisen the thre kynges and the
Archebisshop and Antor, and Guynebaus, that was
brother to the two kynges.  Than thei yede into a chamber that was
be-syde the halle, towarde the gardyn of the river of temse, <MILESTONE N="46b" UNIT="folio"/>and
with hem yede tweyne that ne ought not to be for-yeten, that
was Vlfin and Bretell, and so thei pleide and spake to-geder of
many thinges.  Than be-heilde Vlfin and Bretell, and than he
gan to laugh, for he be-thought hym on the wordes that Merlin
hadde hym tolde, whan they were gon on his message, how thei
were assailed in the deserte of vij knyghtes, and how they dide
hem deliuere.  Than the kynge cleped hem bothe, and comaunded
hem, be the feith that thei hym oughten, that thei sholde hym
telle all the trouthe, how thei hadde spedde in their
message.  Whan thei herde the kynge thus speke, that oon loked on the
tother and be-gonne to smyle, and Bretell ansuerde the kynge,
that thought well he it knewe thourgh Merlin, and seide, "Sir,
wherto sholde we telle you oure spede in oure Iourney, for as
wele ye do it knowe as we oure self, thourgh hym that hath it
tolde, and therfore it were but speche loste."  Than seide the
kynge Ban, "Who is that, that hath hym this tolde?"  "Certein,
sir, the wisest man of the worlde."  "And where is he?" quod
Ban, "and what is name?"  "Sir," quod Bretell, "it is Merlin,
and he resteth in my chamber here-ynne, and by his counseile


<EPB/><PB N="139" ID="pb.139"/>

hath my lorde sente after yow."  "Sir," quod kynge Ban, "lete
hym come hider, for we haue moche disired hym for to see, for
the merveiles that we haue herde of hym spoken."  And Arthur
seide that so wolde he do with gode will.  And than he sente
Vlfin for hym, and ther-with a-noon entred Merlin in to the
chamber agein Vlfin, and seide, "Returne," and so thei wente
be-fore the kynge, and and asked wherefore he hadde sente hym
to seche.  And the kynge ban blissed hym for the merveile that
he hadde, how he myght knowe these thingis, and Merlin seide,
"Ther-of no forse, for here-after ye shull wite I-nough."</P><P>  Than he be-gan to telle a party of his lif, and than com forth
Guynebaude, the clerke, and opposed hym of dyuerse
thynges, for he was a profunde clerke.  And Merlyn hym
ansuerde to alle the questiouns that he asked the very trouthe as it
was, and so indured longe the disputacion be-twene hem tweyne;
and at laste Merlin seide that all for nought he traueylede, "for,"
quod he, "the more thow sechest the more shalt thow fynde."
And than seide Merlin to hem that were a-boute hym, that he
hadde neuer founde no clerke that euer hadde spoke to hym of so
high clergie, ne not blase, that was so holy a man, ne cowde not
so moche enquere.  Wher-to sholde I make yow longe tale.  But
longe they spake to-geder, so that the toon was well a-queynted
with that other, and well thei loved to-geder.  And whan the
disputaciouns were don, Merlin com to the two kynges that were
his brethern, and seide, "Lordynges, ye be worthi men and of
high renoun, and also ye beth right feith-full and trewe; and lo!
here the kynge Arthur, that ought to be youre lorde, and of hym
sholde ye holde youre londes and do hym homage; and he ought
to helpe yow and to socoure agein alle men, yef ye haue nede."
And thei seide, "Merlin, now telle vs how he was chosen to be
kynge, and wherfore, and yef Antor knowe whether he be the
sone of Vterpendragon."  And Merlin seide, "Ye, with-oute faile."
Than he tolde hem <MILESTONE N="47a" UNIT="folio"/>alle the thinges like as was be-falle, so that
the archebisshop and Vlfin it recorded.</P><P>  "Merlin," quod the kynge ban, "we will that thow make
vs sure of oon thinge that we shall aske, for so moche


<EPB/><PB N="140" ID="pb.140"/>

we knowe in yow, that ye will not to vs sey no lesynge for all
the londe that longeth to the crowne."  "A ha," quod Merlin,
"ye desire to haue me sworn that it be trewe that I sey."  And
thei be-gonne to laugh, and seide that ther uas noon so wise as
was he in no reame.  And Merlin seide, "I graunte youre
requeste and youre desire," and so thei toke respite till on the
morn.  Thus ended theire parlament, and departed and yede to
bedde, and the thre kynges and the archebisshop lay in oon
chamber, for they wolde not departe on sondre.  And moche
Guynebaude a-queynted hym with Merlin, that taught hym many
grete maistres and many feire pleyes; and Guynebaude well hem
vndirstode, as he that was wise and a grete clerke, so that he
wrought somme of the craftes ofte in the bloy Breteyne, that
longe tyme after endured, and as it shall here-after reherse.

knowe a mayden that is kynges doughtere and quenes, and of right
high lynage, and also she is right feire, and of grete valoure, that
no lady ne may haue more, and that is the doughter of kynge
Leodegan, of Carmelide, that is now an olde man and hath no
mo children but this doughter, whos name is Gonnore, to whom
the londe moste falle after his discesse; and he hath grete werre
a-gein the kynge Rion, that is of the lynage of Geauntes, and he
is right riche and right puyssant, and yef it happe that he
conquere the reame of Carmelide, that marcheth to the reame of
Logres, that is Arthures, wite it well that Arthur ne shall not
longe kepe his londe in pees, and alle the dayes of his lif he shall
have werre on alle partees; and ne were the knyghtes of the
rounde table, that deffende the reame of kynge Leodegan a-gein
the Geauntes, thei sholde haue all his londe wasted and distroied,
and ther-fore I counseile yow that ye take with yow certain of
youre peple, and go with Arthur, and a-bide with the kynge
Leodegan a yere or two, till that ye be with hym well a-queynted,
and ye shull but litill while be ther, but he shall love yow better
than theym that with him now ther; and knowe it wele that he


<EPB/><PB N="142" ID="pb.142"/>

shall profer Arthur his doughter to be his wif, and ther-by shall
he haue his reame all quyte.  Ne neuer after that the Geauntes
knowe, that he hath her wedded shull they not be so hardy to
a-byde in the contre, ne nygh it by a Iourney."</P><P>  Than ansuerde kynge Ban to Merlyn and seide, "Dere frende,
yef we go in to straunge londe, and leve our londes in
this manere as thei be, how shall ther-of falle, for we haue an
euell and fell nyghbour that vpon vs werre, and brenneth oure
townes and castelles?  Ne this londe also is no-thynge sure, ffor
the barouns that sholde be the kynges frendes and his liege men,
thei do vpon hym werren, therfore it is grete pereyle to leve his
owne reame for to deffende a-nother mannes."  "Ha, sir," quod
Merlin, "ye sey I-nough after youre in-tencion; but it is grete nede
a man to go bak to recouer the better his leep, for wite it well, for
a peny that ye less on this side, ye shall wynne tweyn on that
side; ffor on this party shall ye neyther lese Castell ne Citee, and
on that other side ther shall ye wynne an hool reame, tha euer
after shall deffende this reame."  "I wote neuer," quod kynge
Ban, "what I shall sey, for ye beth more wyser than we alle,
and a-gein me I will do that ye counseile, seth it is so as ye haue
seide ther is no more, but lete vs gon, and therfore devise ye
whan we shull meve, and ther-to lete eche of vs make hym
redy."  "All be-<MILESTONE N="48a" UNIT="folio"/>tyme," seide Merlin, "for ye ne shall not meve
before lenton, for er that tyme moste ye do a grete bataile in this
contree agein the barouns, that assemble and gedere as moche
peple as they may haue, and therfore we shull assemble as many
as we may gete in the pryviest wise that we can, and lete hem be
loigged in a launde that is in the forest of Bredigan, and ne doute
not ther-of but that ye shall do hem more damage than they shall
do to yow."  "Merlin," seide the kynge Ban, "yef I and my
brother sende for socour in to oure contree, may they come
betyme?"  "Ye, trewly," quod Merlin.  "Than shall I sende
thider?" quod Ban.  "Certes," quod Merlin, "I shall go and
do that is ther-to nede, and sonner shall I be ther than eny
messager that ye can sende; but thei be-houe to haste, for the bataile
shall be at Candilmesse, in the medowes of Bredigan, and therfore


<EPB/><PB N="143" ID="pb.143"/>

 youre peple moste ryde nyght and day for to haste hem;
and knowe it verily that I shall be at Gannes be to-morowe at
euen."  And whan they herde that they merveiled gretly, and
than thei hym clipt and made grete ioye.  Than Merlyn cleped
Arthur, and seide, "Sir, I go now on this message, for it is no
tyme lenger to tarye.  Now, sende and assemble knyghtes, and
seriauntes, and arblasters, as many as <CORR SIC="y">ye</CORR> may gete, and ordeyne
that they be sente grete plente of vitaile in to the launde that I
haue nempned, that ye may departe a-monge the peple, for it
shall be grete nede, and make eche man to take vitaile for xv
dayes.  After that they be loigged, as mele and salteflyssh
withoute more; and the gouernours to departe hem shall be Lucas, the
boteller, and Gifflet, and Vlfin, and Bretell; and ye, sir," quod
he to the kynge Ban, "yeve me youre rynge, that I may it take
to Leonces de paerne, youre cosin, be the token that he telle me
that I shall sey to yow."</P><P>  Whan the two brethern herde how Merlin spake they hadde
grete merveile, <CORR SIC="and and">and</CORR> were a-bassht, for thei wende that
no creature lyvinge hadde knowen of that he seide; for he knewe
alle thinges at <CORR SIC="o">oon</CORR> worde as of soche thynges as hym liste to
knowe, were thei neuer so prevy.  And thei seide, "Seth it is so, we
shall delyuer yow the rynge, and wite ye well that we love yow,
and truste more than all the worlde."  "Be my feith," quod
Merlyn, "ye sey as wise men at this worde, and thus moche
shull ye wynne ther-by, that ye shall se oon day how moche that
I do yow love."  With that the kynge toke hym the rynge, and
Merlyn it toke and comaunded hem to god, and yede thider as I
haue yow tolde, and com be Blase, and tolde hym alle these
thynges, that nought he lefte vn-seide; and also tolde hym how
he yede on message in to litill Bretein.  And he wrote in this
boke that Merlin hym tolde, and by his writynge haue we yet
the knowinge ther-of.  With that departed Merlin fro blase,
that lenger ne wolde not tarie, but dide his message well and
feire, ffor on the morowe by pryme he come to Citee of Gannes,


<EPB/><PB N="144" ID="pb.144"/>

and tolde to Leonces that the two bretheren hym sente, and
shewed hym the rynge that was the prevy token be-twene hym
and the <MILESTONE N="48b" UNIT="folio"/>kynge, and Leonces a-noon yaf credence to all that Merlin
seide.  Than a-noon he sente oute and purchased, and gedered so
moche peple, that thei were well x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, alle on horse bakke, armed,
be-fore the Citee of Benoyk, viij dayes be-fore yoole.  Than they
sette kepers in the two Citees that were the two bretheren, soche as
thei wiste was myster, and oon of the kepers was Lambeges, that
was right a trewe knyght, and a gode man of his body, and hym
thei sette in the forteresse of Gannes, and Pharien, his vncle, praide
hym to do well, and he seide so he wolde to his power.  And in
the forteresse of benoyk sette they Rahier de haut mur, that was
right a gode knyght and yonge at pryme barbe; and in the
forteresse of Trebes thei lefte Bawdewyn, the sone of Grassien,
that was the godsone of kynge Ban.  And ther-ynne were the two
susters lefte that were quenes, for that was the beste Castell, and
the <CORR SIC="n">strengest</CORR> of bothe reames.  At Mouloir, a stronge castell of
kynge Boors, thei lefte Placidas, that was a gode knyght and a
trewe.  Whan thei hadde thus garnysshed all the Contree, thei
toke their wey be nyght, for the moone shone clere.  And Merlin
condited the hoste oute fro euyll passages, and so thei traueyled
till thei come to the see and entred in to shippes.  On the tother
side Arthur a-raied hym in the beste wise that he myght, as
Merlyn hadde hym taught, for he sente and somowned, in the
previest wise he cowde, to alle tho that he knewe were his frendes,
and so com grete plente of peple, more than he wende; and some
come thider with gode will for the grete yeftes that he yaf, and
some for to haue of hym a-queyntance for the grete bounte that
thei hadde herde of hym speke.  And whan thei were assembled,
thei were well x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> on horsbak armed, for fotemen wolde thei noon
lede.  And on the tother side come all the cariage of the londe,
that brought vitaile as Merlin hadde hem comaunded.  And the
kynge made the hoste to be ledde, in the stillest wise that he myght,
in to the launde of bredigan, for it was oon of the wildeste places
of that oon knewe, ffor whan thei were ther loigged, thei were,
as who seith, loste.  And the kynge dide oon thynge that Merlin


<EPB/><PB N="145" ID="pb.145"/>

hilde grete wisdome, ffor as soone as the cariage and vitaile was
ledde in to that place where thei were loigged, he sette in euery
wey gode kepers thourgh the londe, that noon ne sholde passe
that ne were take and brought be-fore hym, for that he wolde
noon espye sholde entre in to his londe, for to discure to his
enmys, and made defende oute thourgh his londe, that who ne
heilde of the kynge Arthur ne ride not thourgh his londe be-fore
that Candelmasse were passed, and yef eny ther were that passed,
he dide hem to wite that he sholde other lese his lif or membre
yef he myght be taken, ffor so hadde the kynge comaunded; and
thei heilde hem so in pees that thei com not ther, and ther-of
merveiled the mene peple what it myght mene.  And thus was
the chyuachie so privily kept, that noon wiste where thei be
come, saf only thei of the kynges counseile.  But now stenteth
the tale of hem, and returneth to speke of the vij kynges that
were discounfited at Clarion, and all her companye, as ye haue
herde.</P><P>  Now, seith the story, that sorowfull and full of hevynesse
were the vij kynges, whan thei were discounfited ther as
thei loste all here harneyse of hirs and of <MILESTONE N="49a" UNIT="folio"/>her mayne.  Than thei
swore and assured to-geder that neuer shulde thei be gladde till
thei were avenged of kynge Arthur and vpon his enchauntour, by
whom thei hadde all that losse, yef thei in eny wise myght hym
gete.  In this wise yede the vij kynges, mat and sorowfull for
thire discounfiture wherefore thei sholde be the werse all hir lyf
tyme, and somme of hem were caried in horse lyters that myght
not suffre to ryde, and so thei traueyled smale iournes, till thei
come in to theire londes, and soiourned till thei were hool of her
woundes.  And at the monthes ende thei toke a parlement in a
contre that is be-twene the reame of Gorre and Scotlonde, and
the parlement was this: that eche of hem sholde sende after all
his kyn and frendes, and so go vpon the kynge Arthur and be-reve
hym his londe, and so exile hym fro all the contree; and so thei
sette day to assemble at Bredigan, in the medowes.  Thus thei
departed, and sente for helpe bothe fer and nygh; and com hem
to helpe the Duke Escam, of Cambenyk, with v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men of armes,


<EPB/><PB N="146" ID="pb.146"/>

and also come the kynge Tramelmens, of Northwales, with vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>
men, and the kynge Clarion with iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and the <CORR SIC=" ">kynge</CORR> with
the hundred knyghtes, that was a noble knyght and an hardy,
come with iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and also com the kynge Loth, of Orcanye,
and Leonoys, with vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and the kynge Carados, of Strangore,
com with vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and also the kynge Ventres, of Garlot, com
with vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and the kynge Vrien, of Gorre, com with vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>
Men, and also come the kynge Ydiers, of Cornewaile, with vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>
men; and so thei rode forth smale iournes, as thei that wende
well to distroye the contree.  Than thei sente their espyes
thourghoute the londe, for to knowe the rule of kynge Arthur; but the
kepers that were sette in the contrey a-noon token hem alle, and
sente hem to kynge Arthur, and were sette in prison that thei
cowde heir tydynges.  And these kynges spedde forth her iourney
till thei mette, and were logged vnder the Castell of bredigan,
and were mery and gladde, for thei wende well that they hadde
all wonne.  Thei sente theire forrears through the contrey, but
litill thei fonde to take, ffor all was ledde in to Castelles and
stronge townes, and this was do be the counseile of kynge ban
and the kynge Broos, his brother, that were full wise
knyghtes.  And whan thei saugh that all was gon, and that the peple of the
contrei hadde this don, thei sette all on fier and on flame, and
distroied the londe all that thei myght, and made vitaile be
brought to the oste of her owne londes; and when thei were
alle to-geder thei were acompted lx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  But now cesseth the tale
to speke of hem, and speketh of Merlin, and of the socour that
he bringeth oute of the litill Breteyne, as ye haue herde be-fore.</P><P>  Now, seith the boke, that so Merlin, and Leonces, and Pharien,
and Antoynes, the stiwarde of Benoyk, com to the rochell,
and entred in to the shippes, and so thei sailed till thei com to
the bloy bretaigne, and it is reson that the boke do yow to
vndirstonde whi it is so cleped.  This is the trouthe: after that the
distruxion of troye, it <MILESTONE N="49b" UNIT="folio"/>fill so that two barouns departed and
fledde the contrey, and oute of the londe, for doute of the
Grekes.  Of these two barouns that fledde the londe come grete plente of
peple; and the name of that oon was Brutus, whiche dide a-ryve in


<EPB/><PB N="147" ID="pb.147"/>

this contrey, and dide do make a Citee, that in his lyve was cleped
the newe troye, for that he was come oute of troye, and the londe
was cleped in worship of his name Bretaigne, for that his name
was Brutus; and longe tyme after the dethe of this Brutus com
a-nothir kynge in to this londe, that hight Logryns.  This Logryn
a-mended gretly the Citee, and made towres and stronge walles
enbateiled, and whan he hadde thus <CORR SIC="ameded">amended</CORR> it he chaunged the
name and cleped it Logres, in breteigne, for that his name was
Logryn, and this name dured in to the deth of kynge Arthur; but
after his deth, and the deth of his barouns, that thourgh Mordred
and Agrauayn eche slow other on the playn of Salisberi, as
the boke shall reherse her-after, the deth of launcelot, that was
the sone of kynge Ban, of benoyk.  And so it fill after that ther
was a grete pestelence and slaughter of barouns and of the mene
peple, and for that the losse was so grete, the mene peple cleped
it the bloy bretaigne, ffor that her hertes and her thoughtes were
so bloy and so blake for theire frendes, that thei hade so loste for
myschaunce of synne.</P><P>  Now haue ye herde the cause why this londe was cleped the
bloy bretaigne.  The tother baron that fledde oute of
troye was cleped Corneus.  This Corneus was of the lynage of
Geauntes, and in that contree that marched to bretaigne, and he
was right a mervilouse knyght, and was moche and stronge, and
made townes and Castelles, and men cleped the contrey
Cornewaile in bretaigne, ne neuer after yet this name ne lefte.  And
of hym come the Geauntes, as seith the frenshe book, that
moche harme haue don to the bretouns, wherof this book shall
reherse yow here-after, and also of the merveiles that be-fill in
their tyme.  But now returneth the tale to Merlin, that cometh
in the see, and with hym bryngeth the socour and helpe to kynge
Arthur oute of the litill breteigne.</P><P>  Now seith the boke that whan Merlin and his companye
were arived in the grete breteigne, Merlin comaunded
that all the harneise and armoure sholde be trussed in males and
cloth sakkes, and in other cariage, ffor he wolde not that they
sholde not loigge ne tarye on the wey, but that thei sholde

<EPB/><PB N="148" ID="pb.148"/>

trauaile day and nyght till thei come in to the place where
Merlin wolde hem loigge with the meyne of kynge
Arthur.  And thei dide his comaundement.  And so thei spedde her
iourneyes that the fifte day thei come in to the forest of
bredigan, where thei fonde the hoste of kynge Arthur.  And
bothe hostes made to-geder ioye, as soone as eyder of hem
myght sen other.  Than thei loigged in tentes and pavilouns,
and restede hem so viij dayes hool, and than was the vitaile
departed as Merlin hadde devised.  And than come Merlin to <MILESTONE N="50a" UNIT="folio"/>the wardeyns of the hoste, and seide, "I go to fecche the thre
kynges, for thei shull do beste at this nede than eny other."
And thei seide to Merlin in game, "Loke ye be-war <CORR SIC="of the of the">of the</CORR> tother
parti, for we here sey that thei do manace yow sore."  "I knowe
that well," quod Merlin, "but thei shall neuer haue ouer me no
power; and I do yow to wete that thei haue reson to hate me,
for thei haue no werse enmy, ne noon that may do hem so grete
damage as I shall do, as longe as thei be enmyes to the kynge
Arthur.  But I haue it not yet be-gonne; but be well ware that
noon isse oute of this hoste, ffor than the harme myght neuer be
restored, ffor alle Arthurs enmyes ben loigged here faste by,
vndir the castell of bredigan.  And thei be acompted xl<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> wele
horsed men.  And of oure party we be but xxv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and therefore
we moste be wisely gouerned, or elles we sholde alle lese."</P><P>  "Sir," quod Vlfin, "another ought rather to go on this
massage than ye."  "Nay," quod Merlin, "I can
better lede hem in safte than eny other, so that thei shall not be
seyn ne knowe of no man."  "Now goth, a godes name," seide
the barouns, "and as hastely as ye may come to vs a-geyn."  And
Merlin departed a-noon fro hem so sodenly, that thei knewe not
where he was be-come.  And than thei blissid hem for the grete
merveyle that thei hadde ther-of.  And than thei departed, and
yede a-boute in the hoste and sette soche gouernaunce that noon
was so hardy to meve ne to sette a fote oute of the hoste, ne of
her loiggynge.  And thus thei a-bode iiij dayes that thei ne herde


<EPB/><PB N="149" ID="pb.149"/>

no tydinges of the thre kynges ne of Merlin.  And, as the boke
seith, the same nyght that Merlin departed fro the hoste, he come
to logres be-fore euesonge, where as he fonde the thre kynges full
pensif and hevy, for the contrey that was so wastid and
distroyed.  Than come Merlin so sodenly a-monge hem that thei wiste not
fro whens he com.  And a-noon thei hym clipt and made grete
ioye, and after thei asked hym how he hadde spedde seth that he
fro hem departed; and he seide right wele, and badde hem make
redy to go in to the oste, ffor ther-after the barouns dide a-bide.</P><P>  "How, sir," quod kynge ban, "is oure socour than I-come."
"Ye," quod Merlin, "thei be loigged by Arthurs
oste in the myddel of the launde, in the foreste of bredigan; and
thei be xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> horse-men, and also of Arthurs x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  But on that
other party is moche peple, for ther be x kynges crowned and a
Duke, and thei haue in theire companye l<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> horsemen."  "Now
god helpe vs," quod Arthur, "for this a grete peple."  "Ye,"
quod Merlin, "yet is ther more with this myschef than all this,
ffor thei be gode knyghtes and of high prowesse; but be the
feith that I owe to kynge Arthur, that is my lorde, I hope, with
the helpe of god to do so moche thourgh the <MILESTONE N="50b" UNIT="folio"/>witte that he
hath me sente, that in euyll tyme come thei ther, for thei shall
haue so moche to done that thei shall not a-gein yow endure.  But
ther shall be a bateile, and that shall be grete, and moche slaughter
ther shall be of men and horse; but on owre partye shull not be
deed above xxiiij, but on their syde shall be deed the thowsandes,
and that shall ye se.  And therfore a-noon aray yow, for after
soper we will ride.  And also do lede with yow vitaile for iiij
dayes, for it is not to a-bide lenger."  And whan that thei
vndirstode that Merlin hadde seide, a-noon thei made redy and
araide hem of alle thynges that was nedefull, and than yede to
soper at gode leyser.  And than the kynge asked Merlin yef
thei sholde hem arme.  And he seide, "Nay," for it sholde do
hem to moche gref, ne thei sholde haue no drede of no man
lyvinge be that wey as he wolde hem lede.</P><P>  Whan thei hadde souped thei cloded hem warme as thei
myght, for the froste was grete, and the mone shone


<EPB/><PB N="150" ID="pb.150"/>

clere; and they passed on her iourney.  And ne were no mo
than xxv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> what oon and other.  Whan thei were alle on horse
bakke, Merlin rode be-fore, and the thre kynges and Antor, that
satte vpon a grete stede, whiche the kynge made hym on to
ryde, to be with hem in company; but he wolde haue abiden
with gode chere yef the kynge wolde.  In this maner thei rode
all nyght; and Merlin was Guyde till thei com in a grete
foreste, where thei a-lighte till here mete was made redy.  Than
thei ete and dronke of soche as thei hadde brought with hem, for
thei hadde I-nough.  And whan thei hadden ete, Merlin <CORR SIC=" ">yede</CORR>
to the thre kynges in counseile, and seide, "Sir," quod he to
kynge Arthur, "wote ye what I shall sey:  ye be a yonge man,
and haue a grete reame to maynteyne, and the barouns ne deyne
not to yow obbeye; and also the mene peple ne knowe yow but
litill ne were the great yeftes that ye have yoven.  And,
ther-fore, I say yef euer ye haue be large of yeftes here be-fore, loke
now that ye be larger hens-forth, ffor ye may not so wele gete
the hertes of youre peple as for to be fre and gentill in yevinge;
and ye shull haue I-nough whereof, and I will telle yow how."</P><P>  "I do yow to wite that in this grounde, ther we be now, is
the grettest tresour that may be founde in eny place;
but ye shall not take it till ye be repeired fro the bateile, for ye
shall haue I-nough of other thinges to departe.  And, loke ye,
take gode hede of this plotte of grounde that ye now sitte on,
whan that ye be agein repeired."  Than he shewde hem a welle,
and made ther a signe.  And the kynges were gretly
a-merveiled of that he hadde seide.  And whan thei hadde longe
spoke togeder thei lepe to horse, and rode day and nyght till
thei come in to the hoste, in the foreste of bredigan.  And ther
thei pight the kynges teynte, by the feirest welle and the moste
clere that thei hadde seen.  And it yaf so gret foyson of water
that the brooke ran down the launde, that was right feire and
<CORR SIC="delctable">delectable</CORR>.  And the weder was right colde, for, as the boke
seith, it was in the moneth of Janever, viij dayes before <MILESTONE N="51a" UNIT="folio"/>Candelmesse.  And whan thei were loiged thei rested, and right her
armours, and soiourned so two dayes hool.  Than com Merlin


<EPB/><PB N="151" ID="pb.151"/>

to hem, and seide that "Now fro hens-forth may we go vpon
youre enmyes, and ther-fore devise now who shall haue the
vaunt garde, ffor ye shull go in soche manere that thei shall not
knowe till ye be vpon hem, and that shall be two oures be-fore
day erly; ffor and thei a-perceyve yow thei be so moche peple
that ye may not agein hem endure.  And haue ye no drede, for
ye shall haue the victorye."  Than thei hem armed, and a-raide
in the beste manere, and devised her batailes, and deliuered to
kay the kynges banere, for to bere, that condited the firste
bateile.  And with him was Gifflet and Lucas the boteller, and marke de
la roche, and Aguyuas li blois, and drias de la forest sauage,
and belias the amerouse, and flaundrins le bret.  These viij
knyghtes were in the firste sheltron, and were iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> horsemen;
the secunde ledde Bretell, that was of grete bounte and a trewe
knyght, and a sure of his honde, and he hadde iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> wele
horsed.  The thirde he delyuered to Vlfin, that moche knewe of werre,
and was a full noble knyght.  In this <CORR SIC="warde warde">warde</CORR> was kynge
Arthur, and iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> of gode men that neuer wolde faile their lorde
for no drede of deth, and eueriche of these wardes drough by
hym self a-sonder like as was devised.  And so rode forth a softe
pas kepynge clos, as Merlin dide hem guyde, whiche rode before
vpon a grete courser.  After that the kynge Ban devised and
ordeyned his peple and his brothers, and delyuered the firste warde
to Pharien for to lede, and also to bere the ensigne of kynge

and after that ther come a thounder so grete and merveilously

howsynge and a grete parte of the peple, and hym semed how
hym self was in grete pereile to drowne; and as the kynge loth
was in this affray, he dede a-wake, and hym blissed and was sore
a-baisshed of this dreme that he was in, and a-roos and a-pareiled
hym, and yede to his felowes, and hem dide a-wake and tolde
hem his a vision.  And thei asked hym fro whiche part com the
water, and he seide from the foreste com all the rage and the
tempeste as hym semed.  And thei seide thei knewe verily that
thei sholde hastely haue bataile, and that merveillouse.  And

and comaunded hem to serche all the contre environ, that thei
were not supprised of no peple.  And thei armed hem right

that thei cowden.  And than Merlin be-gan to haste Arthurs
peple, that well knewe the gouernaunce of the tother party, and
thei com so faste on, that thei toke noon hede till thei were euen

And thei ronne to here armes, that yet were in her beddys, and

hem of so grete puyssaunce, that thei turned to flight towarde
her baner where as thei herde the trompe sowne, ffor the kynges
were stynted at the entre of the forest by a river, and ther

Arthur rode with his company till he com ther as the xj kynges
were to-geder assembled.  Whan thei come to the passage <MILESTONE N="52b" UNIT="folio"/>of
the forde ther sholde ye haue seyn speres perce thourgh sheldes,
and many knyghtes liggynge in the water, so that the water was
all reade of blode.  And kay heilde so the pas with the baner,
and payned that his company gate ouer.  And whan the xj

for thei were but iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and thei were more than xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> M<HI1 REND="sup">l</HI1>, thei
hadde ther-of grete despite and shame, and diffended hem
apperly.  And kay and his feliship kepte hem so clos that
noon ne myght hem persch, but longe thei myght it not suffre;
but than com Vlfyn hem to socour, that gretly hem conforted,
and passed the water delyuerly.  And whan thei were ouer thei
smyten in a-monge hem so vigorously that oon myght here the

the bateile at this assemble, and the noyse grete and huge vpon
the helmes and sheldes.  And many a noble man lay ther deed
and wounded, wher-of was grete damage.  But longe thei myght
not this endure; but than com Bretell, and hem sustened, and
moche he hem comforted.  And as soone as bretell was passed
the water he saugh hys company at grete myschef, for he saugh
Vlfin drowen down of his horse in the presse, that heilde his
swerde in his honde and strongly hym deffended, that noon was
so hardy his strokes to a-bide.  And whan bretell that perceyved
he was sorowfull and pensif, for he hym loved full

that he wolde his felowe a-venge yef he in eny wyse

hym a-geyn, and mette so sore to-geder that the sheldes perced,
for bothe the knyghtes were stronge and of grete pris and grete
maltalente, so that her speres splyndered in peces, and that

and helmes, that her yen sparkeled that thei semed thei were
fallen from their heedes so were thei astoned.  And the horses
bar hem so harde that the skyn of the horse knees and legges
were all to rente, that the blode ran to the erthe.  Longe tyme
lay the barouns at erthe with-oute remevynge, so astonyed that
thei ne wiste whethir it was nyght or day; so thei that it
behelden wende eche hadde slayn other.  Thider preced bothe
partyes to the rescowe, and ther was grete losse on bothe
parties.  Than com kay the stiward to the rescowe, and on the
tother side come thre kynges.  Ther sholde ye haue sein fres
encountre, for on Arthurs side was viij, and on the tothir side
were xj; and thei smeten to-geder fiersly.  Ther was Gifflet
vn-horsed, and lucas the botiller, and the kynge brangore, and
the kinge Ydiers, and the kynge Vrien, and the kynge
aguysas.  Ther be-gan the medle grete and merveillouse, and longe it
endured, for thei remounted Gifflet be fyn force a-monge his
enmyes, and that made kay the stiwarde, for he sette Gifflet on
the kynge Ventres horse; and also he smote <MILESTONE N="53a" UNIT="folio"/>down the kynge
loot with a tronchown of a spere that he was sore hurte.  And
with that stroke com the kynge cleped the roy de Cent
chyualers, and hadde in his compayne lx knyghtes of the beste chosen
oute.  And whan he saugh kay the stiwarde hadde smyte down
the kynge loot, hit hym for thought sore, and seide, "But I hym
a-venge I am litill to preyse!"  He spored his horse that wey
and hitte kay so sore that he bar hym vp-right to the erthe, and
ledde his horse to kynge loot, and seide, "Sir, haue heer and
thenke to a-venge youre annoye, for moche haue we loste this
day."  And the kynge loot lepte vp lightly.  And whan Gifflet
saugh kay fallen, and also lucas the botiller, he was sorowfull
and hevy, and hadde recouered a stronge spere, and spored the
horse, and smote a knyght of the kynge de Cent chyualers that
he bar hym to grounde vp-right, and than hente the horse be
the reynes, and presented it to kay; and he lepte vp lightly as
he that hadde grete mystere.  And the kynge de cent chiualers
and kynge loot haue so medled that by fyn strengthe thei haue
horsed the kynge Ventres of Garlot vpon the horse of moret de

la roche, and the kynge ydiers vpon the horse of Guyuas le bloy,
and the Duke Escam of Cambanyk vpon the horse of drias de la
forest sauage.  And whan these lordes were horsed, thei seide
thei wolde be a-venged vpon the losse that thei hadde received, or
elles thei wolde be deed.</P><P>  Than these viij barouns yaf a newe a-saute, but ther was grete
losse of men and horse, whan that Arthur com that gretly
hem comforted and hem sustenyd, for as soone as he was passed
the forde, he smote the horse with spores, and fonde Vlfyn on
fote, and his swerde in his hande, and bretell, that with grete
peyne lepte on horse, wherfore Arthur was sore greved.  He
heilde a grete square spere and smote in to the presse where he
saugh thikkest, and mette with Tradilyuaunt, the kynge of
wales, that com a-gein hym all fressh, and he hym hitte so harde,
that he smote hym thourgh the shelde, that he yaf hym a wounde
in the lifte syde, and hym threwe to the erthe so rudely, that he
hym all to brosed, and Arthur hente the horse by the gilte reynes
and yaf it to Vlfyn, and bad hym lepe vp delyuerly vpon that
stede and thenke to a-venge the shame and the vilony that ye
haue hadde.  And so he dide lightly, and seide, "Sir, gramercy."
And a-noon as Vlfyn was vp he smote in to the presse, and leide
on so harde that he brake the presse, he and kynge and her
helpes that newe were come oute of her enbusshement.  And thei
on the tother side were wroth for the grete damage that thei
hadde, and yet were thei more peple be the haluendell than
hadde Arthur.  Than be-gan the medle right stour, and grete
and mortall, wherefore many a fre moder wepte salt teeres.  Ther
dide kynge Arthur many merveiles in armes, that by his dedis
he was knowe in shorte tyme of many oon that neuer hadde hym
sein, and they yaf hym place alle the moste hardy of hem, for
they ne durste not of hym a-byde a stroke.</P><P>  Whan the kynge, that was called le roy de Cent Chiualers,
saugh the kynge Tradelyuanunt <MILESTONE N="53b" UNIT="folio"/>reuerse to the erthe he
was right wroth, for he hym loved with grete love, and he was
merveilously wele horsed, and he rode fiercely to kynge Arthur,
and smote hym so sore vpon the helme that he was astonyed.


<EPB/><PB N="158" ID="pb.158"/>

And whan the kynge felte the stroke, hym for thought it sore,
and so dide kay that was in his company.  The kynge cam
formest grypynge his swerd for to smyte hym thourgh the
helme.  And whan he saugh the stroke come, he coured hym with his
shelde, and the kynge hym smote so harde, that the haluendell
fley in to the felde; and the stroke glenched vpon the horse hede,
and smote it of be the eres.  And so thei fill to grounde, the
horse and his maister.  And kay be-heilde and saugh an horse go
a-stray, and he caught it and yaf it to Antor.  And he lepte vp
lightly, and after caught a spere, and smote margnam, the
stiwarde of the kynge cleped roy de Cent chiualers, so harde
thourgh the shelde and the lifte shulder, that the spere hede
shewed thourgh, and he fill to the grounde vp-right, and
ther-with brake the spere.  And he leyde honde on the horse, and
ledde it to Bretell be the reyne, that ther-of hadde grete
nede.  And he lepte up delyuerly, and than he be-heilde a-boute in the
presse, and saugh lucas the botiller lye a-monge the horse feet
full doelfully.  And Gifflet a-bode by hym, and deffended hym
right vigerousely, and moche hym preysed and comended, for
ther was a-geyn hym xiiij, and he but sool by hym-self; and yet
myght thei not gete on hym no grounde for powert hat thei
hadden.  And whan bretell saugh this he com thider, and smote
the first that he mette so harde thourgh the helme that he slyt
hym to the teth, and after he smote the seconde on the arme,
that he made it fle in to the felde with all the shelde; and than
the thirthe so harde vpon the lifte shulder that he it deseuered
from the body.  Whan Gifflet saugh he hadde socour, he smote
oon so harde on the temple that he slyt it to the nekke; and he
fill down deed.  And Gifflet toke the horse, and ledde it to
lucas <CORR SIC="h">the</CORR> boteller.  And he lept vp angry and wroth, as he that
wolde fayne a-venge his shame.  And than he hente a spere
grete and sharpe grounde, and saugh Aguysans, the kynge of
Scotlonde, and rode a-gein hym full egerly, and smote hym with
all his myght thourgh the coler of his haubrek so sore that he

lepte vpon the horse delyuerly, and rode in to the bataile, that

not dide but enforce more and more, and fonde belias and
flaundryns, that were arested vpon diras, and on dionas tweyne
of her felowes, and peyned hem for to remounte hem on her
horse; but so grete was the presse that thei hadde no leyser hem
to be-holde.  And so thei foughten so strongely that it was
merveile to be-holde.  And thei smyten in monge hem, and
be-gonne to do so wele, that the two felowes were agein sette on
horse.  And on the tother side faugh the kynge Arthur and his
meyne so longe and the noyse and the cry aros of the two
kynges that thei hadde vn-horsed.  And so thei ronne to the
rescowe on bothe sides, that oon for to socour, and the <MILESTONE N="54a" UNIT="folio"/>tother to
helpe the kynge Arthur.  Ther was the medle grete.  Ther
eche wounde and kylde other; but with grete payne were the
two kynges rescued and sette on horse.  But first was ther grete
occision, for the kynge Arthur kepte hem so shorte that thei myght
not hem socour for power that thei hadden; and ne hadde be on
a-uenture that fill thei sholde neuer haue be rafte from Arthur,
for he ran the rescow of kay and Gifflet, that kynge Ventres,
and kynge brangores, and kynge Vrien, and the kynge Abigans,
hadde ouer-throwen from theire horse, and hem defouled vnder
the horse feet full lothly, and hadde no mo hem to deffende but
lucas the botiller, that these all so moche greved.  Whan the
kynge Arthur saugh this nede, he turned that wey as wroth as a
lyon, and leide a-boute hym on bothe sides, and slow all that he
raught with a full stroke, so that thei voyded hys strokes and
hym rome.  And kay and Gifflet pressed to the kynges, that
moche hem hadde greved, and with hem sore foughten.  And on
the tother side faught bretell and Vlfyn and Antor with the duke
Escam of Cambenyk, and a-geyn Tradilyuaunt, and a-gein clarion,
of Northumberlonde, and agein Carados, that was a noble knyght;
so thei made hem to blenche thider, as kynge Arthur faught,

it myght not longe endure with-oute grete damage.  Than
com vpon hem the kynge Ban and the kynge Boors from
the foreste, where thei wende to haue no drede of no man
lyvinge.  And whan thei were come an thei hem sye, thei
yaf ascry that all the foreste and the river resounde; and
thei saugh well that the losse and the damage moste nede falle
vpon hem.  Thanne the princes and the barouns drowen a-part
to-geder in the medowes, and devised a-monge hem self what

neuer how ye be a-vised to do, but as for me I shall vpon iij or

vndirstode how kynge loot hadde seide, he preisede hym moche,
and seide that in the same maner wolde he do; and so dide
kynge Carados, and the Duke Escam seide the same, and the
kynge Clarion of Northumbirlonde seide also in the selue
maner.  "Now than," quod kynge loot, "I shall telle yow what we
shull do.  Lete vij of us go a-gein hem that come fressh oute of

sore, as thei that were full noble knyghtes and of grete renoun;
and grete doel and pite was it for the euyll will be-twene hem

till it was even toward nyght.  And on the tother side come the
kynge Ban and the kynge boors, and leonce and Pharien, that
ledde the firste bataile, and come clos a softe pas, and full longe
hem thought er thei were mette to-geder.  And on the tother
parte com a-gein hem the kynge ydiers.  And when thei aproched
nygh thei lete renne and smyte to-geder so harde that ye myght

stoure and harde bataile, and grete occision of men and of horse,
but thei myght not suffre longe, ne endure the peple of kynge
ydiers, but were driven bak vpon the warde of kynge Aguysans
of Scotlonde, that gretly hem counforted and sustened.  Here
be-gan the bataile merveilouse and harde.  And the peple of
Pharien were sore ouerleide; but as leonces of Paerne com hem to
socoure, and a-sailed hem so fiercely, that noon ne abode in the

returned a-gein to hem that hadde hem enchased.  And ther thei
stalleden and foughten the ton vpon the tother till thei were

Carados from these other, and rode clos a softe pase a-gein the

entrauerse lysted as grene as a mede, and the stremers down to

entermedled that oon with the tother.  And whan thei saugh
the kynge Ban, that dide hem so moche damage, loot was right
wroth, and so were the tother kynges.  Than he smote the horse
with the spores that wey, his swerde in his honde; and he was a
noble knyght and an hardy, and smote the kynge Ban vpon the
shelde a grete stroke, that a cantell fleygh in to the
feilde.  And whan Ban saugh this it a-noyed hym sore; and than he lifte
vp the bronde, and ficched hym in the styropes so harde that the
Iren bente, and wende to smyte the kynge de Cent Chiualers
vpon the helme, and he that douted, and the stroke blenched,
and smote the steede with the spores, and the stroke descended
be-hynde, and smote a-sonder the trappure of mayle, and thourgh
the horse to the erthe; and so thei frussht bothe on an hepe, the
horse and his maister.  And whan the kynge was fallen he lepe
vp delyuerly on fote, his swerde in his honde, and his shelde
coverynge hys side.  When the kynge Brangore saugh the
kynge de Cent chiualers falle, he ran vpon the kynge Ban, and
smote hym so grete a stroke thourgh the shelde that he slit
a-wey a grete quarter.  And the kynge ban hym yaf so grete a
stroke thourgh the helme that he slyt the sercle and the koyf of
Iren to the heed, and yef the swerde hadde not glenched he
hadde be deed.  And he fill to grounde astonyd.  Whan the two
kynges were releved thei be-gonne the medle a-gein the kynge
Ban; but he hym deffended so wele that thei hadde more

com the kynge Arthur, brekynge the presse, gripynge his
swerde, all be-soyled with blode of men and of horse, for he dide
many merveiles of armes with his body.  And whan he saugh
the kynge Ban at so grete myschef, he wax wode for Ire.  Than
he rode to a knyght that richely horsed; and Arthur lifte vp the
swerde, and smote hym thourgh the helme soche a stroke that he
slyt hym to the teth, and he fill to grounde.  Than he toke
the horse be the reynes, and ledde it to kynge ban, and seide,
"Frende, lepe on lightly, for in euell tyme ben oure enmyes

ther were many slayn and defouled.  So were thei distreyned
be-twene the wode and the river.  Ther thei stalled and a-bode,

oure peple shull be all loste and distroied.</P><P>  Thus chased hem the kynge Arthur and the kynge ban
be-fore alle other, till thei come to a grete water and a
depe, where as thei that fledde hadde made a brigge of tymber
and of plankes.  And thei passed over the water after the
tother, and so enchased hem the kynge Arthur and the kynge
Boors, that thei come to that brigge that was so made, and wolde
passe ouer after hem.  And than com Merlin and seide, "Kynge
Arthur, what wilt thow do?  haste thow ouercome thyn enmyes?

and entred in to the forest, and fonde blase, that longe after hym

than he tolde hym how the hethen peple were entred in to the

socour yef he hadde power; but the kynge Rion, that is so
myghty and riche, vpon hym werreth, and hath do this two
yere.  Ne the kynge Pelles of lytenoys, for the kepeth the kynge
Pellynor his brother that lyeth seke, of whiche <CORR SIC="senesse">seknesse</CORR> he shall neuer
be heled till he come that shall brynge to ende the auentures of
the seint Graal.  Ne of the kynge Alain, his brother, that lith
in sekenesse, and shall neuer be warisshed till the beste knyght
of alle Bretouns come and aske hym why he hath that maladye,
and what thinge sholde be hys helpe.  And of the kynge of Sorloys
ne may we haue no socour, ffor Galehaut, the sone of the Geaunte,
of the oute yles, werreth vpon hym, and will that that holde his
londe of hym, and he hym diffendeth as he may.  Ne of the
kynge Berennain ne may we haue <MILESTONE N="59a" UNIT="folio"/>no socour; ne of the kynge
Anadonain, ne of the kynge Clamadas, for alle these werreth;
and Calchous, that is cosin to the kynge de Cent chiualers, that
now for vs hath traueyled—god quyte it hym!  And I knowe
wele as soone as Galehaut may haue conquered these two remes,
that than he will come renne vpon vs, for he desireth nothinge so
moche as for to haue the reame that was Vterpendragon.  Thus
can we no counseile but god of his mercy vs helpe and rede;
and while we be now to-geder, lete vs ordeyne what is beste to
do, for it is nede.  And yef it be so that we discorde, than be we
vtterly distroyed, for well ye knowe that we haue loste grete
auoir, where-with we myght wele haue mayntened oure werres
a-gein the saxoyns.  And witeth it wele that this damage haue
we be the counseile of Merlin, that wente to fecche the kynge
ban of Benoyk and the kynge boors his brother, in the litill
Breteyne, that ben the beste knyghtes of the worlde.  And he hath
do hem to make homage to kynge Arthur; and witeth it wele also
that as longe as Merlin is in contrey a-gein vs we shull not a-gein
hym endure, ffor noon ne is so wise ne so puyssant that may of

also that is do and seide; and therfore I sey wepinge, ne
makynge of sorowe, ne may vs not a-vaile; but wemen shull
wepe.  And lete vs take hede to saue the peple and the londe fro
these vn-trewe and misbelevynge sarazins that thus sodenly be
entred vpon vs.  Therfore, for the reuerence of oure lorde, lete
vs haue pite of the people and the londe and on oure self."  And
ther-with he satte down and was longe tyme er eny baroun seide
eny mo wordes.</P><P>  Than a-ros the kynge Tradilyuaunt, of North Wales, and
seide as he that was a full wise man and wele I-lerned,
"The beste counseile that I se is that we go stuffe the marches
on this partye ther the saxouns comen, and lete make all the
chyuachie, that we may assemble of all the chyualrie that we
may, and lete kepe the passages, that ther come to hem no more
socour ne vitaile than thei haue now; and in the meene while
lete vs geder oure kyn and oure frendes and sowderes out of alle
londes, and lete vs yeve hem bateile as soone as we may be
assembled, for other-wise I can not se how thei may be remeved fro
the sege."  Whan the lordes vndirstode this that the kynge
Tradelyuaunt hadde seide, thei preised hym moche, and seide it
was the beste counseile that myght be sette, and ther-to thei
a-corded alle to do as he hadde seide.  Than thei asked that whiche
marches thei sholde garnyssh, and with what peple; and soche was
theire counseile that thei sholde go with as moche peple as thei
myght brynge of hem that were lefte of the bataile to the Citee of
Huydecan for to garnyssh it there.  And so thei dide it stuffe.  And
that was a grete Citee and a stronge.  And than with the firste
puyssaunce that we may make, lete vs distroye the vitaile fro
them thourgh the contreye, and lete vs sette in eche garnyson <MILESTONE N="59b" UNIT="folio"/>as moche peple as we may, and yef we do thus, I sey yow for
sothe that we shull thus distroyne them more than and we faught
with hem euery day.  And whan we se that theu be-for hungred,
and that thei be not encresed of more peple than thei be now,
than lete vs assemble oure peple and fight with hem, and yef
we may hem discounfite, we shall be riche and in reste alwey

Now lete eche man sey that hym likes, for I haue seide myn

wolde repente with gode will of the stryfe that thei hadde a-gein

acorded to garnysshe the marches of Galnoye and of Gorre, and
of galuonye towarde Cornewaile and Orcanye.  And than thay

kynge Ydiers with iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men of armes of hem that ascaped fro the

that he hadde vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml </HI1>at his baner of Sowdiours.  And thei kepte
wele the contre ther-a-boute, and ofte tyme fought thei with the
saisnes, and ofte sithes thei wonne.  And so com the renoun in to
the hoste, that thei durste not ride that wey with-oute grete
foyson of peple.  And so on that part the kynge Ydiers kepte
hem so streyte that thei myght haue no socoure of no vitaile.


<EPB/><PB N="177" ID="pb.177"/>
</P><P>  The tother Citee that thei yede to stuffe was cleped
Wydesans, and thedir yede the kynge Ventres of Garlot, and
ledde with hym knyghtes that were lefte of the hoste.  And
whan thei com to Wydesande in Cornewaile the lordes made
hym grete ffeste, for gretly were thei discounforted of the grete
hoste of saisnes that thei hadden seyn passe be-fore the Citee, and
ledde a-wey alle theire prayes, and alle theire townes a-boute
brente and exiled.  And as soone as kynge Ventres was come, he
stuffed it wele with vitaile and with peple, and sesed the beste
tour and the beste fortresse.  Than sente he for sowdiours thourgh
the londe, and in other contreyes, so that he hadde a vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> what
on horse-bakke and on fote men with hem of the contrey, where-of
were v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> defensable.  And so wele he kepte his marches that the
saisnes hadde but litill socour, and ofte sithes he faught with
hem where the saisnes loste more than wonne; ffor the kynge
Ventres was a noble knyght and hardy and enterpendaunt.  He
hadde a sone be his wyf, <MILESTONE N="60b" UNIT="folio"/>a yonge bacheler of xvj yere of age,
that was of merveilouse grete bewte; and the wif of kynge
Ventres was suster to kynge Arthur on his moder side, Ygerne, that
was wif to Vterpendragon, and wif also to Hoel, Duke of
Tintagell, that be-gat basyne, the wif of kynge Ventres.  And vpon this
basyne be-gate he his sone, that was so gode a knyght and hardy,
as ye shall here her-after, and how he was oon of the C.C.l.
knyghtes of the rounde table, and oon of the moste preysed, and
his right name was Galashyn, the Duke of Clarence, that the
kynge Arthur hym yaf after he hadde wedded his wif

kynge Ventres his fader hadde foughten with kynge Arthur, his
oncle, and he herde the grete prowesse and the grete debonertee
that was in hym, he com to hys moder basyne, and seide.  "Feire

to the quene Ygerne, that after was wif to Vterpendragon, that

remembred, "Ffeire sone," quod she, "knowe this truly that he
is youre vncle and my brother and cosin to youre fader on the
modirside of Vterpendragon, as I haue herde my moder sey many
tymes whan she here complayned prively in her chamber for her
sone that the kynge Vterpendragon made it to be delyuered to a

Vlfin dide witnesse this thinge for trewe, that so wele was

my moder and the kynge; but the barouns of this londe ne will
not knowe hym for her lorde, and oure lorde, that is so
mercyfull, hath hym chosen thourgh his high myracle that he hath
shewed many sithes."  And than she tolde hym of the ston and
of the swerde, and alle the auenture as it was be-fallen.  And
whan Galashene vndirstode his moder, he prayed god that thei
sholde neuer wele spede that hym were ageyns, "and," quod he,
"god lete me neuer dye till that he hath made me knyght.  Ha
now god yeve me grace to do so moche that he may me girthe
with my swerde, and I shall neuer departe fro hym while I may
lyve yef he will me with-holde a-boute hym."  With that he
departed from his moder and yede into a chamber, and be-gan to
stodye howe he myght spede to go to the kynge Arthur.  Than
he be-thought hym to sende a messenger <MILESTONE N="61a" UNIT="folio"/>to Gaweyn, the sone
of kynge loot, his cosin, and sende hym worde that he sholde
come to speke with hym at newewerke, in brochelonde, as

But now rested the tale of the message of Galashene and speke
of the kynges, how thei departed fro Shorhant, and wheder thei
wente, and telleth of the auentres that to hem be-fillen.</P><P>  Now, seith the boke, that after that kynge ventres, of Garlot,
was departed fro the Citee of Sorhant, and the other
barouns also, as ye haue herde, That than the kynge loot wente
to the Citee of Gale with iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> knyghtes and fightynge men of
hem that were lefte in the bataile where thei hadde be
discounfited.  And whan he com thider the Cetizenis made of hym grete
ioye, ffor gretly thei were affraied of the saisnes that eche day
rode and renne thourgh the contrey, and toke prayes and putte
fire in townes <CORR SIC="a">and</CORR> vilages all a-bowte as thei wente, and dide grete

somowned all the peple that he myght, bothe fer and nygh, of

right wele the Citee and the contre environ that noon that entred
ne myght but litill it mysdo; and ofte tymes he faught with the
saisnes whan that he herde telle that thei come to forrey, and
ther wan the pore bacheleres that ther-to hadde grete myster;
and ther the kynge loot ne toke neuer thinge fro hem that thei
dide wynne, but frely yaf hem all, and ther thourgh encresed
his grete loos that the peple hym yaf.  And therfore com to

hym speke, whiche ne wolde neuere haue hym seyn but for the
high renoun that was of hym spoken, and that he was manly and
wise and full of largesse, and ther-of shewed wele his sones after
hym, but oon yet more than another, after the gode lynage that
thei were come of, and I shall telle yow how.</P><P>  This is trouthe that the wife of kynge lotte was suster to
kynge Arthur by his moder side, in the same manere as was
the wif of kynge ventres.  And of the wif of kynge loot com
Gawein, and Agrauayn, and Gaheret, and Gaheries; these iiij
were sones to kynge loot.  And of hir also com Mordred, that
was the yonghest, that the kynge Arthur be-gat.  And I will

<EPB/><PB N="180" ID="pb.180"/>

telle yow in what manere, for so moche is the storye, the more
clere that I make yow to vndirstonde in what wise he was
be-geten of the kynge; for moche peple it preyse the lesse that
knowe not the trouthe.  Hit be-fill in the tyme that the barouns
of the reame of logres were assembled at Cardoell in walys, for
to chese a kynge after the deth of Vterpendragon.  And the
kynge loot brought thider his wif, and so dide many a-nother
baroun.  Hit fill so that the kynge loot was loigged in a faire
halle, he and his meyne; <MILESTONE N="61b" UNIT="folio"/>and in the same loigynge was Antor
and his sone Kay and Arthur, in the pryvieste wise that he
myght.  And whan the kynge knewe that he was a knyght, he made hym
sitte at his table, and Kay, that was a yonge knyght.  And the
kynge lotte hadde do made a cowche in a chamber, where he and
his wif lay.  And Antor lay in myddell of the same chamber,
and kay and Arthur hadde made her bedde atte the chamber
dore of kynge loot, in a corner, like as a squyre sholde
ly.  Arthur was a feire yonge squyer; and he toke grete hede of the
lady and of hem that were a-bouten hire.  And he saugh that she
was feire and full of grete bewte, and in his herte he covetted
her gretly and loved; but the lady ne knewe it not, ne toke
ther-of noon heede, for she was of grete bounte and right trewe to
hir lorde.  Hit fill that the barouns hadde take a counseile for to
speke to-geder at the blak crosse.  And whi it was cleped the
blake crosse ye shall here her-after, and the names of the knyghtes
of the rounde table, but yet the tyme is not come to speke ther-of
more.  At this crosse the barouns toke a day for to assemble erly
on a morowe; and so it fill that on the nyght before that the
kynge loot sholde go to this counseile, and he comaunded that
previly his horse were sadeled a-boute mydnyght and his armes
were alle redy.  And thei dide all his comaundement so secretly
that noon it perceyved, ne not the lady her-self.  Thus a-roos the
kynge a-boute mydnyght, that his it ne wyste ne a-percyved it
nought.  And he wente to the parlement to the blake crosse, and
the lady lefte a-lone in the chamber in her bedde.  And Arthur,
that alle this toke gode kepe, sawgh well how the kynge was
gon.  And he a-roos as stilliche as he myght, and yede to bedde


<EPB/><PB N="181" ID="pb.181"/>

to the lady, and lay turnynge and wendynge, that noon other
thynge durste do leste the lady sholde hym a-perceyve.  And hit
fill so that the lady a-woke and turned hir toward hym, and toke
hym in her armes as a woman slepynge, that wende verely it
hadde ben her lorde.  And that nyght was be-gete Mordred, as
ye haue herde.  And whan he hadde don his delite with the
quene, a-noon after she fill on slepe.  And Aurthur a-roos sleyly
that he was not a-perceyved, till on the morowe, that he
hym-self it tolde at the dyner, whan he serued her at table
knelynge.  And so it happed that the lady seide, "Sir squyre,
arise vp, for longe I-nough haue <CORR SIC="y">ye</CORR> be knelynge."  And he
ansuerde softly, and seide that he ne myght neuer deserue the
bountees that she hadde hym don.  And she hym asked what
bounte it was that she hadde hym don.  And he ansuerde he
wolde not in no wise telle it here but yef she hym ensured that
she sholde hym not discouer to no pesone, ne purchase hym no
blame, ne harme.  And she seide that it sholde not hir greve, and
ensured hym with gode will, as she that of this thynge ne toke
noon kepe.  And than he tolde hir how he hadde leyn by her
that <MILESTONE N="62a" UNIT="folio"/>nyght; and than hadde the lady grete shame, and wax all
rody, but noon ne knewe the cause.  And than the lady lefte her
mere vntterly.  And thus lay Arthur by his suster, the wif of
kynge loot, but neuer after it fill her no more.  And so the lady
vndirstode that she was grete by hym; and the childe that she
hadde at that tyme was of hym with-oute faile.  And whan the
childe was born, and also the tidynges spredde a-brode that he was
the sone of Vterpendragon, she loved hym so moche in her herte,
that no man myght it telle.  But she durste make no semblant,
for the kynge loot hir lorde; and she was sory for the werre that
was be-twene hym and the barons of the reame.</P><P>  Upon a day Gawein com fro huntynge, and clothed comly in
a robe that was warme as a robe for the wynter, and
ledde in honde a leeshe of grehoundes, and ledde also two brace
folowinge hym.  And it be-com hym full wele all thynge that
he dide:  and he also was of the feirest makynge that eny man
myght be as of his stature.  But the tale ne of hym deviseth no

more here saf only of a tecche that he hadde, that whan he a-roos
that he hadde the force and myght of the beste knyght that

doubled, and at the houre of tierce also; and whan it come
to mydday he com a-gein to his firste strength that he hadde
at the houre of tierce; and whan it come to the houre of
noone he doubled, and alle houres of the nyght, and in the
morowe he com a-gein to his firste force; this was the
custome of Gawein.  Whan Gawein entred the halle, as ye harde,
his moder lay in a chamber by a chymney wher-ynne was a grete
fiere, and she was right pensif for her brother the kynge Arthur,
and for the barouns that were departed fro hym in euyll will, and
of the grete mortalite of peple that was come by the foly of the
barouns of the londe, and also of the saisnes that were entred
in to the londe, wher-fore thei were in a venture to be distroide;
and ther was she sore dismayed.</P><P>  And whan the lady saugh Gawein, that was so feire a yonge
squyer and noche of his age, and thought it tyme for
hym to a knyght, and than she be-gan to wepe and that hevied
moche Gawein, and asked wherefore that she dide wepe, and she
ansuerde and seide, "Feire sone, that I haue grete cause, for I
se yow and youre bretheren that spende youre tyme in foly, that
fro hens-forth ye oughten to be knyghtes and bere armes, and ye
sholde be at the court of kynge Arthur, for he is youre oncle,
and is the beste knyght of the worlde as it is seide, and ye sholde
hym serue, and purchase the pees be-twene hym and youre fader,
for it is grete damage of the euell will be-twene hem and the
other barouns of the londe that sholde hym love and serue, but
for their pride thei dyne not hym to knowe for her lorde, and
wele it sheweth that it displeseth our lorde, for more haue thei

ye for trouthe that this Arthur that now is kynge that
he be youre brother and myn oncle?"  "Feire sone," seide she,
"ne doute yow nought, for youre oncle is he trewly."  And than
she tolde hym, fro the be-gynynge to the ende, all how it
was.  And whan Gawein hadde all vndirstonde, he seide full debonerly,
"Feire moder, ne be not ther-fore so pensif, for, be the feith that
I owe on to yow, I shall neuer be girde with swerde ne bere
helme on myn hede till that the kynge Arthur make me knyght,
yef in me be so moche valoure that he will me a-dubbe, and we will
go to courte for to fecche oure armes and helpe to mayntene his

sone," than seide the lady, "for me shull ye neuer be letted, ffor
grete gladnesse sholde it be to me yef oure lorde wolde graunte
that ye might do so moche that youre fader and youre oncle were
gode frendes, for than sholde I haue gladnesse at myn herte, and
I ought wele aboue alle other."  "Dame," quod Gawein, "cesseth

moder, "god graunte yow grace this to performe."</P><P>  In the tyme that Gawein and his moder spake thus to-geder
com in Agravayn and Gaharet and Gaheries, and com
be-fore theire moder, that heilde stille her talkynge with
Gawein.  And than seide Agravain to Gawein, "Ye be more to blame than
eny other, for ye be oure eldeste brother, and ye ought to lede vs
forth, and that we sholde be knyghtes, and serue hym that all the
worlde of speketh that a-boute hym repeire.  And we ne do but
as musardes, and ne a-wayte nought elles but whan we shall be
take as a bridde in a nette, for the saisnes be but a iourne hens,
that all the contre robbe and distroye.  Ne we ne haue not peple

<EPB/><PB N="184" ID="pb.184"/>

to chase hem hens but by the prowesse of the kynge
Arthur.  But lete us take oure armes of hym, and helpe to defende his
londe a-gein his enmyes; ffor that is the beste that I can se, for
here ne may we nought gete.  And, ther-fore, better it were for
vs to do some prowesse in his servise, yef we myght be of soche
valoure, than here to be take to prison as cowardes, and lese oure
time of oure ages."  And whan Gawein vndirstode the speche of
his brother, he hadde of hym hertely ioye, and moche he hym
preysed, and ansuerde that so wolde he do; "and, therfore, in
haste lete vs a-pareile vs, for we will meve <MILESTONE N="63a" UNIT="folio"/>hens with-ynne xiiij
dayes."  And whan the moder saugh that hadde this
vndertaken, she was full of ioye, and thanked god hertely.  And to
hem she seide, "Dismay yow nought of no-thynge, for I shall
ordeyne yow horse and harneys."  And ther-of were thei gladde
and merye.  But now here resteth the tale of the moder and of the
childeren, and speketh how the kynges departed fro Sorhant, that
be yet sorowfull and wroth for theire discounfiture and losse, and
also for the saisnes that be entred in to her londes and Contrees.</P><P>  Now seith the story that whan these thre kynges were
departed fro their felowes fro Shorhant, that thei a-bode till
sowderes com to hem grete plente.  And than departed Clarion,
the kinge of Northumberlonde, and rode to his Citee I-cleped
bellande, that is grete and so feire, and garnysshed it wele with
thre<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men of armes, with-oute hem of the Citee self, that were
wele v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> or mo.  And he kepte wele the marches a-boute hym,
and many tymes faught with the saisnes like as ye haue herde
tolde.  And some tyme he wan, and many tymes he loste, as is
the fortune of werre.  And right moche he greved the saisnes,
for he distrued the prayes and the vitaile, so that the foreyours
myght nought fynde in the contrey for to take.  After that
departed the kynge de Cent chyualiers fro the Citee of Sorhant
with iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men of armes, and wente to the Citee of malonant,
where he hadde a gentill lady.  This Cite marched to his londe,
but for it was nerre the passages where as the Saxons dide passe,
that was the cause that he com thider, for he was full of high
prowesse, and also right a wise man and a noble knyght, and


<EPB/><PB N="185" ID="pb.185"/>

hadde euer-more in his company an hundred men on horsebak
armed whan he hadde leeste peple; and ther-fore was he cleped
le Roy de Cent chiualers, that is to sey, kynge of an hundred
knyghtes; but his right name was cleped Aguysans.  And he
kepte right wele the marche and the contrey ther-a-boute, that
litill wonne the sarazins vpon hym.  After that departed the
kynge Tradylyuans, of North wales, fro the Cite of Sorhant, and
wente in to North walis to his City with iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men of
armes.  And his peple were of hym gladde, for thei hadde be in grete
drede of the Saxouns, that wente thourgh the londe and dide
hem grete harme and damage, ffor the passages were ther to go
to the roche of saisnes, where-of thei were sore a-noyed and
greved.  And he sente thourgh his londe, and somowned alle
tho that myght armes bere, and for sowdiours bothe fer and nygh,
so that he assembled to-geder what on hors and on fote with the
peple that he hadde brought fro the bataile vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> with-oute the
men of the Citee, wher in was iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> of dwellers.  And so he hym
defended the beste wyse that he myght, and moche he hem
greved toward the Castell that Carnyle, the suster of hardogabran,
kepte in her baillye.  Ne that passage ne myght not these thre <MILESTONE N="63b" UNIT="folio"/>kynges kepe for no power that thei hadden; but that ther com
socour be that wey to the saisnes of vitaile and of men be that
castell that was stronge, and by the enchauntement of Carnile,
that moste cowde of that art, but yef it were Morgain, the suster
of kynge Arthur, and Nimiane, that Merlin dide love so moche,
that he taught here alle the merveiles of the worlde as this boke
shall declare yow here-after.  And by that Castell where-of I
speke hadde the saisnes all her recouerer and all her socour of the
contrey, wherthurgh thei myght neuer be put oute of the londe
till that kynge Arthur drof hem oute, and the kynge Ban and
the kynge Boors of Gannes, and the sones of kynge lott, as ye
shull here telle here-after, and of theire merveilouse prowesse of
dedes of armes.  After that departed fro Sorhant the kynge
Brangore, of South Walis, with iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men of armes, and wente to
Strangore, his chief Citee, for that was nexte to the roche of
Saxouns, ant sente after soudiours vp and down, and assembled


<EPB/><PB N="186" ID="pb.186"/>

vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men defensable, and moche thei greved the hethen peple
with alle theire power.  This kynge Brangore hadde a gentill
lady to his wif, that was doughter to kynge Adryan, the
Emperour of Constantynenoble, that was myghty and riche.  And
he hadde no mo childeren by his wif but two doughteres, where-of
the kynge Brangore hadde oon, and the tother was in
Costantynnoble.  In that tyme ther was a riche lorde and a myghty, that
was kynge of blagne and of hungre; but he deyde with-ynne
v yere after he was wedded, and lefte a sone, the feirest creature
of man that was formed.  And this childe dide wex moche and
semly, and right wise and hardy.  And at that day that kynge
Brangore was departed fro Sorhant, he was so well waxen that
he was able to be a knyght; and his right name was
Segramore.  This Segramore that I of speke dide after-warde many high
prowesse in the reame of logres, whereof the tale shall declare
yow here-after, and I shall tell yow how it fill.</P><P>  Renomee that thurgh alle the worlde renneth yede so
thourgh euery londe, so that euery contrey spake of the
kynge Arthur and of his grete largesse.  And so his renoun
spredde thourgh euery contre, so that in Costantynnoble it was
in euery mannes mouthe; So that Segramore herde ther-of speke,
and was but xv yere of age, and was oon of the feirest men of
the worlde, and of large stature, and beste shapen of alle
membres, and ther-to hardy and wise.  And whan he herde tidynges
of the kynge Arthur he desired gretly to se the day and the houre
that he myght be made knyght of hys honde, and seide often to
hem that were of his counseile that who so myght take ordere of
chiualrye moste in eny wise be a gode knyght.  And whan his
graunt-sire, the kynge Adrian, that tho was livynge, counseiled
hym to take the ordere of knyghthode, for he was the next heire
male to the Empere after his deth.  And he hym ansuerde that he
wolde neuer be knyght till that Arthur, the kynge of grete
breteyne, hadde made <MILESTONE N="64a" UNIT="folio"/>hym a knyght with his owne
hondes.  And so here-of spake thei day be day till that the kynge Adrian
appareiled Segramore, and sente hym to the grete breteyne
richely arayed.  But now cesseth of hym to speke more at


<EPB/><PB N="187" ID="pb.187"/>

this tyme, and turneth to telle how these other knyges departed
fro Sorhant.</P><P>  Now seith the storye that as soone as kynge Brangore was
departed fro Sorhant, that the kynge Carados made hym
redy to ryde; and with hym he hadde iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men armed, and yede
to Eastrangore, his chief Citee, and hit garnysshit vigorously, as
he that was full of prowesse and grete hardynesse, and sente
after knyghtes and sergeantes, alle that he myght haue he hadde
assembled, vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> speres and gode men of werre.  And in tho
partyes the saisnes ne soiourned but litill, for often were the
foughten bothe even and morowe as thei saugh tyme.  And often
Carados and his company lay in the forestes, that were large and
depe; and whan he herde telle that the saisnes com in forrey
thourgh the contrey, he lepe hem a-geyns and faught with hem,
so that ofte tymes he gat vpon hem and mayntened so the werre
longe tyme, as the tale will reherse here-after whan the mater
cometh ther-to.  And after that these vj kynges were departed
fro Sorhant, departed than Aguysans, the kynge of Scotlonde.</P><P>  This Aguysans, the kynge of Scotlonde, that departed out of
Sorhant, was the richest kynge of alle the xj kynges,
and was also the yongeste; but of armes he cowde not so moche
as the other kynges.  And he assembled his peple, and were
v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and wente to Corenge in Scotlonde, that tho was a grete
Citee and a riche, and moche were greved with the saisnes that
repeired ther-a-bowte, for it was but xx scotyssh myle fro the
Castell of Vandesbires, ther-as was the sege of saisnes, that
repeyred ther-a-boute so grete peple that noon myght hem nombre
that ther assembled euery day.  And as soone as that the kynge
Aguysans was sette in the Citee of Corenges, thei were gladde
that were in the Citee of whiche were v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  And he sente alle
a-boute for sowdiours on hors and on fote, so that he hadde x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>
with-oute hem of the Cite.  And so he faught many tymes with
the saisnes as thei ronne thourgh the Contrey; and so he bothe
loste and wan many tymes.  And he made to a-mende and fortyfie
the wallis of the town ther as, as thei were most feble; and thus
he mayntened the werre longe tyme.  After that these kynges

<EPB/><PB N="188" ID="pb.188"/>

were departed, the Duke Escam assembled his peple, and hadde
with hym iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men of armes; and he iourneyde so till he com to
Cambenyk, his stronge Citee, that was grete and riche and full
of alle maner godes, and with-ynne the Cite were iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men
defensable, that of the Duke made grete ioye when thei hym saugh, for
gretly hadde thei be affraide of the saisnes that thei hadde
seyn come towarde a Castell that is cleped Arondell, that was in
the marche of Cambenyk, and the roche of Saisnes, that the
kynge Arthur hadde well garnysshid er he wente in to <MILESTONE N="64b" UNIT="folio"/>the
reame of Tamelide.  And as soone as the Duke com to Cambenyk
he comaunded and somowned all his power fer and nygh, and
assembled wele viij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men with-oute hem that were in the Citee;
and thise greved the saisnes at theire power.  In this maner the
Duke hym contened in this maner richely as ye haue herde.  Thus
departet the xj barouns fro Sorhant; and the kynge Vrien leffte
in his Citee, and sente thourgh euery londe and contrey a-boute,
and sowdiours so that he hadde to-geder ix<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, with-oute the peple
of the Citee, where-of were wele vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and the sege was thens
but a iourne.  And so thei fought to-geder many tymes, and loste
and wonne as is the fortune of werre.  And thus this stryfe lastid
longe tyme, so that the contrey was wasted and made pore so sore
that in v yere ther in was nought to gete.  And in the contrey
they lived by nought elles saf by that oon myght take of a-nother
by-twene the cristen men and the saisnes, but yef eny ship by
aventure a-rived at eny port in the londe.  In this manere were
thei sustened that other-wise ne laboured not, but werred that
oon a-gein that other right harde.  And the saisnes ronne thourgh
the londe of kynge Arthur, and þer-Inne dide grete damage, for
ther was noon that hem dide lette, till that by a-uenture, as god
wolde, he sente feire yonge squires and gentill it to socoure.  And
I shall telle yow what thei were that so longe kepte the londes
of kynge Arthur, till that he com a-geyn oute of the londe of
Tamelide; so that the saisnes loste more and the barouns, that
were his enmyes, than dide Arthur.  And now returneth the tale
a-gein to Galashyn, the sone of kynge Ventres.

vauasours of the londe, that after were of grete prowesse in the house
of kynge Arthur, and of soche as were moste preysed.  And as
soone as the childeren saugh the grete damage, theire hertis
begonne to ryse, and cried, "As armes, gentill squyres, for now
shall it be sene how is goode and hardy and worthy to bere
armes, for we be in oure heritages, and ther-fore we sholde deffende

that thei hadde socoure, ther com to hem more than v<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> what on

and mette firste the cariage and the vitaile that the saisnes ledden
towarde the hoste, and were moo than iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> with the cariage.
And, as the storye seith, it was passed mydday and was right hote
weder.  And the duste a-rose so thikke that scantly a man myght
se fro hym-self the caste of a stone.  And as soone at that the
childeren saugh theire enmyes, thei lete theire horse renne, and
overthrewe and slowgh alle that thei ateyned, that ther ne
ascaped oon ne other.  That day Gawein slowgh many a sarazin
of the saxouns more than eny of his felowes, so that he was all
blody, bothe he and his horse.  And he heiled an axe in his
honde, and he was so crewell and fiers that whom he a-raught a
full stroke neded hym no salue.  And his other bretheren dide also
right wele, so that noon of hem ne durste a-bide of hem a
stroke.  And Galashyn was all day with Gawein, that merveilously dide
wele, for ther myght noon endure his strokes that he ne smote of
arme, or legge, or heede, or other membre; but, a-bove alle othir,
it was merveile to se the martire that Gawein made, for a-gein
his strokys ne myght not endure Iren ne style, ne no mannys
body, were he neuer so myghty ne stronge.  And so the
childeren smyten vp and down a-boute hem that of iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> that ledde the
pray towarde the hoste, ne ascaped not xxx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1>.  And x of hem
that ascaped returned vn-to her chiuachie, that were comynge after

to be trussed for the grete hete that hem greved.  And whan the
x that fledden com in to the hoste <CORR SIC="the">thei</CORR> cryed that all was deed
that were lefte with the cariage.  Whan thei herde that all was
loste, thei ronne to theire armes alle they that eny hadden,   <MILESTONE N="66b" UNIT="folio"/>and
hem armed in the beste wise that thei myght.  And the thirde

part of hem ne myght not come to theire armoure, for theire

hadde wonne, and let it be ledde to logres, and lete it be
condited by men of the same contrey, that the were dwellynge and
weren fallen in to theire company; and after thei pursude the
saisnes that fledden in to the tyme that thei were fallen in

stoure, and harde and crewell, that merveile it was to haue
seyn.  Ther Gawein slowe the kynge noas, of Iselonde, for he smote hym
with an axe with bothe hondis, that he cleft hym to the briste
bon.  And Galashyn smote so the kynge Sarnagut with a swerde
trenchaunt that he made his heede fle in to the feilde.  And
Agrauayn, that was plonged in to the presse, smote on bothe
sides hym a-boute, and began yeve so grete strokes that sore thei
hym douted.  And Gaheries hadde chased Gynebande the length
of a bowe draught from his felowes, for that he hadde smyte
down <CORR SIC="his his">his</CORR>   brother Gaheret with a spere, but he hadde noon other
harm; and, therfore, wende well Gaheries he hadde be slayn;
and, therfore, he pursude vpon hym with swerde drawen, as
fiercely as a wilde boor.</P><P>  Whan Guynebans saugh Gaheries so fiercely come, he turned
to flight, for he ne durste not a-bide for the grete
merveilouse occision that he hadde seyn hym do; and,
withoute faile, he was of merveilouse prowesse, for, as the story
reherseth, it failed but litill that he was even like of bounte
to Gawein his brother, whan he com to his right age and was
knyght.  And whan Gaheries saugh the sarazin thus fleynge,
he swore be god that he sholde neuer cesse ne leve hym, for
playn ne wode, till he were a-venged of his brother deth.  And
so he hym chased as faste as his horse myght hym bere till
he hadde lefte his felowes be-hynde the space of an
arblaste.  And so he hym overtoke a-monge the meyne of Guynebans,
that com redy to fight, and gladde were they of the pray
that thei hadde so ledde.

</P><P>  Whan Gaheries hadde overtake Guynebans, he stroke hym
so sore vpon the helme that he kutte a-wey a quarter
that he made hym to stope, and the swerde swarued be-twene the
shelde and the nekke, and kyutte the gyge of the shelde with all
the arme so that he dide it falle in to the felde.  And whan this
kynge saugh hym-self so dismembred he fill in swowne; and than
Gaheries was gladde of the vengaunce of his brother, and turned
his horse hede.  But the saisnes that this stroke hadde sein ne
contented not to lete hym passe; and than thei hem renged by
hundredes and by thowsandes, and closed hym in on alle
partyes, and smote vpon hym with theire speres at ones, and
ouer-threwe hym and his horse.  And whan the tymbir of theire
speres were broken, he lepe vp-on his fete vigerousely, as he that
hadde I-nough of breth; and myght that ther was noon so hardy
that durste put to hys honde hym to take, and launched at hym
fro fer speres and swerdes   <MILESTONE N="67a" UNIT="folio"/>and knyves, that thei made hym falle
on his knees two tymes or thre; but so myght he not longe
endure but that he sholde haue be take or deed.  Than a squyer that
saugh hym chase so the hethyn kynge, com cryinge and betynge
his hondes to-geder, and rendinge his heer to Gawein, that hadde
remounted Gaheret vpon a-nother horse, that hadde smeten down
the kynge Sernage fro.  Than the squyer cried, "Ha,
Gawein!  where-a-boute arte thow?  for thow hast loste thy brother Gaheries
but thow hym socoure delyuerly; for he chased a saisne that he
hath ouertake in this derke valey, and hath hym smetyn down;
but the sarasins haue be-sette hym on all partyes, and haue hym
ouerthrowen, and slayn his horse, and made hym falle vpon his
kne I wote not how often; and yef ye hym thus lese it is grete
doel and grete damage."  Whan Gawein vndirstode hym that
made soche doel for his brother, he seide, "Ha!  seint Marie
Virgin and moder of Jeshu criste, ne suffre not that I lese my
brother, for than myn herte shall neuer be gladde; and yef I hym
thus lese, shall ther neuer shelde hange a-boute my nekke."  Than
he asked of the squyer whiche wey it was.  And he shewed hym
the valey be the wode side.  And he cryed to his felowes with
high voys, "Now shall it be sein who that shall me serve."

</P><P>  "Feire cosyn," quod Galashyn, "whider will ye go in so
grete haste, shall noon a-bide from yow, and therfore
set forth smartly, for I drede lest we tarye to longe?"  Than the
childeren hem renged and priked as faste as quarelles of arblast,
and perced the presse with his gode horse and heilde an axe
in bothe handes wherewith he made soche martire and soche
slaughter, that thei fly from hym on alle partyes; and it lasted
the space of a myle a-boute of the peple that thei hadde leide to
grounde, and thei sought vp and down till thei founde Gaheries,
that was lyggynge at erthe vp-right, and thei hadde pulled of his
hatte of stiell and his coyf of mayle for to smyte of his heed, but
thei thought to haue take hym quyk, and lede hym to Bernage,
the kynge of Saxon.  Than thei fillen vpon hym at ones, and
wolde bynde his hondes be-hynde hys bakke.  Than com Gawein
prikinge gripynge a spere, and sprange in a-monge hem so full of
ire and maltelent for that he sawgh his brother so vileinliche
a-raide, that ny he yede out of witte, and than he leide a-boute
hym so grym strokes and rude that noon durste hym a-bide, but
disparbled a-brode fro hym as from a wode lyon in rage.  Whan that
thei that heilde his brother saugh the merveile that he dide, thei ne
durste not a-bide ne holde his brother no lenger, but yef thei wolde
haue receyved the deth, but turned to flight and made hym
wey.  Whan Gaheries saugh his brother Gawein, he lepte vpon his feet,
and sette on his heed his hatte delyuerly, and hente a-gein his
swerde, and appareilede hym to diffende.  And Agrauayn hym
brought an horse, and seide, "Brother, now lepe vp lightly, for
grete foly haue ye do to go so fer oute of oure company, for full
nygh hadde ye more loste than wonne."  Whan Gaheries saugh
hym-self hooll and sounde, and that he was a-gein I-horsed and
delyuered, he was right gladde.  Than the bretheren drough
hem to-geder to relied her peple; and the saisnes blewe hornes
and trumpes, and armed hem and assembled hem thourgh all the

ther-to right hardy; and ran vpon hem so fiercely as he
hymself alone all wolde haue confounded.  And Gawein, that was

hym fiercely.  And Guynehan, that com formest, ran a-gein hym,
and smote Gawein so harde with his spere that it fley all to peces,
for the haubreke was so stronge of dubble maile, and the squyer
so full of prowesse, that he ne meved not for the stroke, but yaf
Gynehans soche a stroke with his ax vpon the helme that he bente
ouer his horse croupe; and the stroke of the ax glenched, and
smote the horse bakke a-sonder, that thei fill to the grounde bothe

smote amonge hem, and thei smote hym with theire speres and
slow his horse vnder hym.  And he lepte lightly vpon his feet,

his ax; and the saisne saugh he myght not voyde the stroke,
and caste his shelde ther a-geins.  And Gawein hym hitte so
harde that he slytte the shelde in two partyes.  And the stroke
descended on the lifte shulder so grete that he slyt hym to the
girdill, and than he fill to grounde.  Than Gawein sesed the

"Now shewe youre hardynesse, that these Sarazins not vs ascape,
and that nother wode ne playn hem shall warante, for ye shall
se my strokes and my prowesse double."  Than he smote the
stede, and rode in a-monge hem, and made of hem soche martire
that thei lay vpon hepes in the feilde, as hey in a medowe; but
for all that the saisnes haue horsed Guynehans.  And whan he
was remounted a-monge the saisnes, he hente a stronge spere and

Gaheries smote hym with his swerde vpon the arme, that it fly

and the shulders as he was stopynge, that he made the heed
fle in to the playn, and Galashin with his fote spurned his body

knewe thei no tidynges, for he was so depe in a-monge the

whether thei were discounfited or noon, he hovid stille till he
saugh his felowes comynge, and whan that he knewe it were

heilde hym be the helme at the erthe, and peyned sore hys heede

ther-with Gawein smote so grete strokes a-monge hem that he
made hem alle to disseuer, and it fill so that Madalen com in his

redy armed hem-self to deffende in bataile a-gein theire enmyes;

<EPB/><PB N="205" ID="pb.205"/>

and alle tho that ne wolde not come, he lete hem well wite that
thei sholde haue as streyte Iustice as longed to theuis and
traytoures; and also the kynge leodogan sente after hys frendes and
sowdiours ouer all where he myght hem gete for golde or siluer,
and ther com so grete plente of oon and other, that thei were
assembled on the ascencion euen in the medowes vndir Toraise,
and loigged in teyntes and pavilouns, xl<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, what on horse bakke
and on fote, with-oute hem that were in the town, where-of ther
were vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>; but the story seith that in tho dayes fyve hundred   <MILESTONE N="70b" UNIT="folio"/>was
cleped a thousande.  In the tyme that kynge leodogan hadde
somowned so his peple, it be-fill on a tewisday, at euen, in the
entreynge of May, That the kynge Ryolent and the kynge
Phariouns, of Irelonde, and the kynge Senygres, and the kynge Serans,
were departed fro the hoste with xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men of armes, and ran
thourgh the contrey for vitaile, whereof thei hadde grete nede;
and it be-fill that thei com wastynge the contrey toward Torayse,
where the kynge leodogan of Tamelide soiourned, and a-bode his
peple that he hadde sente after.  Than herde the kynge the noyse
of hem that gadered to-geder the pray, and robbed the londe and
the contrey a-boute Torayse, and thei of the town hem perceyved,
and than thei closed the yates, and the knyghtes that were
with-ynne at soiourne ronne to theire armes and lepe to theire horse,
and assembled hem to-geder with-ynne the yates.  Than were
alle the knyghtes of the rounde table armed, and the gouernaunce
of hem hadde hervy the Rivell and males ly bruns, and thei were
two hundred and fifty that alle were noble gode knyghtes and trewe,
and were so worthi in armes, that vndir sonne men myght fynde
noon better: these were alle in a wynge by hem-self, for thei
wolde not be medled a-monge noon other; and on the tother side
side the knyghtes and the peple of the Citee arayed hem, and
thei were iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and of these hadde the stiward the gouernaunce
hem to lede, that was cleped Cleodalis.  This cleodalis was wonte
to bere the chief baner of the kynge, but euer after that the
knyghtes of the rounde table were come, hervy the Rivell it bar;
but he bar a smal ganfanon of two smale losenges of goules, and
the feelde of golde and crownes of ynde; and the grete baner that


<EPB/><PB N="206" ID="pb.206"/>

hervy bar was of iiij losenges full of crownes of golde.  Whan thei
were well armed, thei renged hem be-fore the portes, and a-bode
the comaundement of the kynge; and whan the kynge was armed,
he lepe on a grete stede of greet bounte, and rode to the baner
that hervy bar, and ther he hoved still till thei saugh come the
sarazins, and were mo than vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> on horsebak.</P><P>  And on the tother side was arthur well armed, and alle his
his companye, and thei were alle richely horsed.  And
Merlin bar that day the baner, and he comaunded hem alle, that
as dere as thei heilden her owen bodies, that thei sholde sue that
baner all that day in what place that it yede; and thei seide alle
that thei so wolden.  Than thei set forth her wey thourgh the
town, so fresch and richely armed that no peple might be better,
and thei were xlj, with-oute Merlin that bar the baner, soche oon
that for a grete merveile was be-holden of oon and other that
day, for he bar a dragon that was not right grete, and the taile
was a fadome and an half of lengthe tortue, and he hadde a wide
throte that the tounge semed braulinge euer, and it semed sparkles
of fier that sprongen vp in to the heire out of his throte.  With
that com Geauntes, and the Sarazins, and smote theire speres vpon
the yates of the town, and after   <MILESTONE N="71a" UNIT="folio"/>turned down the medowes, for
thei fonde no man that yaf hem ansuere, and gadered to-geder
alle the prayes of bestes that were in the medowes.  And Merlin
eschuwed alle that were in the stretes of the town, and rode
thourgh hem euen to the yates with his meyne, and seide than
to the porter, "Lete oute, for it is tyme;" and the porter seide
thei sholde not oute of the yates till the kynge hadde
comaunded.  "What," seide Merlin, "makeste thow daunger of that I haue
as grete power as thow."  Than Merlin caught the flayle of the
yate and plukked it to hym and yede oute as lightly as it hadde
not haue ben lokked, and than departed oute <CORR SIC="mage">magre</CORR> how it
grucchid.  Whan these xlij felowes weren oute of the town, than
the gate was as close as it hadde neuer be opened at that tyme,
and of that merveile blissid the kynge ban and the kynge boors
his brother, and alle the tother.  And Merlin priked faste his
horse till he ouer-toke a grete company of sarazins that were two


<EPB/><PB N="207" ID="pb.207"/>

thousande or mo, that ledde grete plente of beestes, and Merlin
frusht a-monge hem with his banere, and his companye with hym,
and leyde on sore strokes, and in her metynge ouer-threw alle that
thei countred, and in lesse than an hour thei hadde hem so slayn
and chased, that thei toke the pray and ledde it to the gates of
the town; but thei hadde gon but a-while when thei saugh iiij
kynges com with xv thousande men of armes, that ledde so grete
cariage of robbery that thei hadde piled thourgh the contrey, and
were towarde the see.  Whan Merlin hem saugh, he seide to his
felowes, "Suweth me," and thei so diden; and it fill so that
a-noon, as Merlin hadde caste a charme, there rose soche a wynde
and storme so grete, that the powder and the duste a-rose with
the wynde, and smote in the visages of the Geauntes and sarazins,
that oon myght not right wele knowe a-nother.</P><P>  And a-noon as the xlij felowes were in a-monge hem, thei
slowe and ouerthrewe so many that it was wonder to
thinke; and than comaunded the kynge leodogan to open the
yates.  Than Issed oute first the stiwarde Cleodales formeste (with iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>
men of armes), and fonde the yate close where as thei yssed oute,
that foughten agein xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men so harde that it was merveile.  Than
com Cleodalis with his banere, and smote in a-monge the presse right
hidously; ther sholde ye haue herde grete brekinge of speres, and
grete noyse of swerdes vpon helmes and vpon sheldes, that the
sownde was herde in to the Citee clerly; ther was grete defoulinge
of men and horse; but there the xlij felowes shewed merveiles
with her bodies.</P><P>  Whan these iiij kynges saugh that these were a-monge hem
medelinge, thei departed her peple in tweyne, and lefte
viij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> fighting stille; and vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> rode a-gein the banere of kynge
leodogan that thei saugh come oute of the town, and the ton rode a-gein
the tother full fercely; and whan thei neighed nygh, thei lowed ther
speres, and   <MILESTONE N="71b" UNIT="folio"/>yaf to-geder so grete strokes vpon sheldes, that thei
perced haubrekes, and dismailed, and many ther were throwen to
grounde sore bledynge with stroke of speres, and many ther were
that passed thourgh with-oute fallinge.  Whan the speres were
broken, thei leide honde to swerdes, and be-gonne the bataile grete

and merveilouse; but ther sholde ye haue seyn the knyghtes of
the rounde table do wondres, and thei were but CC and fifty, and
thei that were fightinge with hem were vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and so were the
knyghtes of the rounde table at gret myschief, for thei be-hoved
to disparble, whethir thei wolde or noon, and voyde the place;
but thei heilde hem to-geder so close and streite, that noon myght

and the kynge placiens saugh that so litill a peple withstode so
grete a power as thei were, thei hadde ther-of grete merveile and
grete dispyte; than thei cried theire ensigne, and swore that
neuer oon of hem sholde ascape.  Than thei yaf hem a grete shoure
and a felonouse, for at that shofte thei ouerthrewe mo than xl,
and moche thei hem peyned hem to diffoule and to maymen, but her
felowes were vpon hem arrestynge, and hem deffended from theire
enmyes with her swerdes with all theire myght; and than it fill
that the kynge leodogan was throwen fro his horse full lothly,
and thei token hym with strengthe and ledde hym toward prison,
with moo than v<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1>, in to the hoste of kynge Rion of Irlonde, and
thei hym ledde full fiercely, for thei wende wele that alle here
werre hadde be fynysshed.  And so thei ledde the kynge leodogan in
alle the haste that thei myght, and whan the kynge leodogan
saugh hym so mysfallen, and that his enmyes hadde hym taken,
he sowowned often tymes and made grete sorowe; and thei that
hym ledden spedden hem so faste that thei were fro the town two
myle.  Full grete was the noyse of the vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> and the
CC l. knyghtes of the rounde table that were full hevy and wroth for
the kynge that thei hadde loste, and than seide a-monge hem and
assured to-geder seth it was com ther-to, and that thei saugh all
sholde be loste, than thei wolde avenge her shame and deth as
longe as they myght lyven.  Than thei sette her bakkes eche to

of men and horse a-boute hem with-oute remevynge oute of place,
and so moche peyne and traueile thei suffred, that thei that were

saugh her fader ledde a-monge his enmyes, she made so gret

sorowe that nygh she slowe hir-self for doell.  But now lete vs
cesse to speke of hem till tyme cometh a-gein, and speke of the
kynge Arthur and his felowes, how that thei haue spedde in the
bataile a-gein the viij thousande with the stiwarde Cleodalis of
Tamelide.</P><P>    <MILESTONE N="72a" UNIT="folio"/>Now, seith the storie, that stronge and crewell was the stour
ther as the bateile was, where as the xlij felowes and the
iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml </HI1>that were with Cleodalis, the stiwarde, that foughten a-gein
viij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> Sarazins; and many ther were slayn that lay grennynge on
the grounde.  And whan thei hadde longe tyme fought to-geder,
Merlin rode a grete walop oute of the bataile, and cried to his
felowes that thei sholde sue hym, and thei so dide in grete haste,
and rode as faste as the horse myght hem bere, till that thei were
passed all theire peple, and than thei encresed her pas gretter, and
rode towarde the siege the right wey ther as the Geauntes and
the sarazins were, till that thei come in a valey that was right
depe, and ther thei ouer-toke the v C sarasins that ledde the kynge
leodogan; and as soone as Merlin hym saugh, he cried, "Now
lordinges, vpon hem, for ye be by-trayed and deed yef eny of
of hem ascape."  Than thei drive in a-monge hem as tempest of
thunder, and kilde and slough all that thei raught a right stroke
in her comynge, and ther ne was noon of the xlj but he slowe or
maymed whom that he mette.  Ther sholde ye haue seyn soche
martirdom, and soche slaughter of men and of horse, that noon ne
myght ascape, so were thei supprised and a-stonyed, saf oonly
fyve that ascaped, fleinge thei rought neuer what wey.  Thus
haue thei rescowed the kynge leodogan; and whan the kynge
saugh the grete martire and the occision that so fewe peple hadde
don a-gein so many, he merveyled gretly what thei myght be;
than he be-heilde and knewe it was the dragon that Merlyn
bar.  Than knewe he wele that it were the sowdiours that he hadde
with-holden, and than he thanked god of the socoure that he hadde
hym sente.  Than com Merlin to hym, and than he rested; whan
saugh the kynge leodogan bounden he alight, and so dide Bretell,
and hym vn-bounden, and right his armoure, and sethen made
hym to lepe on a steede that was stronge and swyfht; and the


<EPB/><PB N="210" ID="pb.210"/>

kynge hem thonkeden hertely of the servise thei hadde hym
don.  Than cried Merlin, "Gentill knyghtes, what tarye ye heere
so long?  suweth me!"  Than he rode a grete raundon towarde the
town, where the knyghtes of the rounde table were at gret myschief,
that of CC l. ne were but xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> on horsebak, but deffended hem on
fote as wilde bores; and Merlin bar the baner be-fore, and rode as
faste as he myght, and his felowes also, that theire horses swetten;
and the dragon that Merlin bar caste oute gret flames of fiere,
that it sparkeled vp in the ayre, that thei vpon the walles of the
town saugh the clernesse of the light half a myle longe.  Whan
thei of Citee saugh the kynge that was her lorde, and saugh it
were the xlij felowes, and with hem the kynge leodogan that
thei hadde rescued, thei hadde grete ioye; and whan Gonnore
this saugh, she spronge for ioye, and merveiled what the knyghtes
were that com in that company; and thei com as faste as thunder
so harde a-monge her enmyes, and in her comynge ech   <MILESTONE N="72b" UNIT="folio"/>threwe

in a-monge hem, ther be-gan a grete bataile, and soche slaughter
of men and horse, that the maiden that was lenynge oute at the
wyndowes of the paleise herde the grete strokes.  Ther yaf the
kynge ban, of Benoyk, many strokes with corchense, his gode
swerde, ffor whom he a-rafte a full stroke, ther waranted hym
neither shelde, ne haubreke, ne noon armure, that he kutte all
thourgh-oute at oon stroke, and many sithes he smote bothe horse
and man to grounde at a stroke, and so dide hys brother, the
kynge Boors, of gannes.  And the sarazins hem be-heilde for grete
merveile that thei saugh hem do; and the kynge Arthur dide
soche merveiles with Calibourne, his gode swerde, ffor ther a-gein
myght noon armure endure, were it neuer so stronge, ffor what
he a-raught was at his endynge for euer.</P><P>  Grete was the bataile be-fore the town of Toraise ther as the

hoste of alle the Geauntes; and the storye seith that the kynge
ban was a moche knyght of body, and a stronge, and coragous
and hardy.  The kynge heilde corchense, his gode suerde, and
smote the kynge Clarion so sore vpon the helme that he slit it
dowon to the eere, the stroke fill vpon the lifte shulder, that he
slitte hym to the girdell; and the kynge Boors so smote Sarmedon,
the ganfanoner, that he kutte of the arme with all the sheilde,
and the baner fill to the erthe.  This stroke saugh the kynge
leodogan, and seide, "Now be there no knyghtes but these that
so well conne helpe at nede."  And whan the Geauntes saugh
theire lorde deed, and her baner fallen, thei turned to flight, oon
here another there; and than com oute of the town knyghtes and
sergeauntes two thousande, and be-gonne the chase vpon hem that
turned to flight; but Merlin turned not that wey as thei fledde,
but wente to the bataile ther as Cleodalis faught fercely with

haue herde that in her comynge ferde as tempeste, and ther-to
thei were alle so well horsed that no men myght be better, and
the kynge leodogan was euer with hem that in no wise wolde

wente to the rescew of Cleodalis, the stiwarde of Tamelide, that
was a noble knyght, and right trewe, and full of grete hardynesse,
and well it shewde that for noon vnkyndenesse that the kynge

leve hym in his myscheif in no nede that he was in, but
therynne he dide moche more than many other wolde haue don, and
I shall sey yow the cause why.  This was the troweth, that the
kynge leodogan hadde a wif, a lady of grete bewte and of high

her fader londe, after that he hadde her wedded, this lady brought
with hire a mayden that was of grete bewte.  This maiden loved

and the lady that was lefte with the quene for companye, that
moche her lovid with grete love, hit fill on a nyght that the
kynge leodogan lay by the quene, and that nyght vpon hir he
begat a doughter, that was cleped Gonnore whan she was
baptised, the whiche after was of merveilouse bewte and the wif of
kynge Arthur; and this lady that was wif to kynge lodogan was
a goode lady and holy of livinge, and hadde an vsage to a-rise on

to messe.  That nyght that the quene hadde conceyved Gonnore
her doughter, she yede to matyns, and com by the stiwardes wif,
and fonde her slepynge and wolde not her a-wake, but wente and
lefte her lyinge a-slepe, and wente forth a-lone to the cherche,
that was faste by, with hir sawter in her hande; and the kynge,
that longe had desired to speke with that lady, a-rose as soone as
the quene was gon, and dide oute the taperes that were
brennynge, and than wente to ly by the stiwardes wif, and whan the
lady felte oon lyinge by her, she asked what he was, all affraied;
and than he ansuerde how it was he, and bad hir be stille, and
seide yef she made eny noyse she sholde be deed.  The lady her
deffended I-nowgh as with speche, but she durste not crye ne
make no noyse; but litill a-vailed her defense, for the kynge by

had geten Gonnore on his wife.  And whan the quene was
delyuered ther was founde vpon the childes reynes a litill crosse

wolde not the stiwarde sholde speke with hir.  In soche maner
he heilde her more than v yere, till that the stiwardes frendes
spake vn-to hym, and he seide he wolde not faile the kynge
while he hadde werre, and yet the same tyme that kynge Arthur
com for to serue, he hir heilde in the selue maner, and yet for all
this the stiwarde neuer feyned to serue.  But now lete vs retourne

myght haue hadde damage.  Here assembled agein all the
turnement, and Cleodalis was horsed vpon a grey steede, and he yet
heilde the kynges baner stille.  Than he cryde his ensigne fierscely
and rode in to the presse, he and his men, as faste as the horse
myght renne; and ther was than merveilouse stour and harde,
for than ther sholde ye see many a knyght ly ded vnder the horse
feet; but the saisnes were so many that they myght not be perced
lightly thourgh, but stode stiffly a-gein the crysten.  Than fill it
so that the vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> that were discounfited be-fore Torayse fill to the
peple of Sonygrenx and Sorfrain, and ther a-bode all tho that
fledden so thikke that thei putte the cristen bakke more than the

a foote londe fro the place, and ther Sonygrenx was vn-horsed, but
with grete peyne was Sonygrenx remounted, that foule and
dispitously was diffouled vnder horse feet, and than was the stour
renewed, for sore he hym peyned to a-venge the same that he
hadde resceyved, and ran vpon the cristen, he and his men, and
smote hem sore with swerdes and speres, and enclosed hem rounde
a-boute.  Than Merlin smote in to the presse vigerously with the
baner in his honde, and the knyghtes of the rounde table, that
were remounted and newe araide, com to that medle a softe pase

and kay and lucas the boteller be with hem medelinge, and
therfore folowe after me, for a-noon shull we se who shall do beste

that swyftly hym bar, and smote in to the medle that was right
grete of fyve knyghtes a-gein x Geauntes grete and stronge out of

he mette first with the kynge Sonygrenx, and the kynge Ban
gript his swerde, that was all be-soyled with blode and brayn,

the stroke, that was grete, descended be-twene the shelde, and
kutte a-sonder the gyge with all honde that it fly in to the

the helme euen down to the teth; and the kynge Boors smote
so Seleuaunt that he slitte a quarter of his helme, the swerde
glenched vpon the lifte shulder and smote it clene a-sonder, and

as the saisnes saugh these down, thei were so dismayed, that of
a grete space thei meved not, and seide to hem-self that grete
foly it were to fight with hem lenger but yef he wolde be

of the rounde table, the peple of Sonygrenx were
discounfited; but thei wolde not hem enchase, for Merlin hem
with-heilde, and drough hem a-parte in to the feilde, and seide,
"Feire lordinges, now lete hem gon, and besye ye not hem to
enchase, ffor ther-to shall come tyme here-after; but drawe yow
a litill a-bakke, and a-light down on fote, and drawe to-geder
yowre peple, and refresshe yowre horse, and lete hem reste, and
than girdeth hem newe a-gein;" and thei dide his

than seide hervy de ryuell that he wolde go be-fore

as thei that ther-to hadde grete nede.  And the kynge leodogan
com to Merlin, and seide, "Sir, will ye not that these worthy
men come in youre companye?"  "Certes," seide Merlin, "sir,
we will right wele, and þei be right welcome,   <MILESTONE N="75b" UNIT="folio"/>for we be the
better that thei be with vs in felisship."  "Sir," seide the kynge,
"gramercy."  Than yede the kynge leodogan to hervy de rivell,
that bar the baner, and seide, "Feire frende, come ye and youre
felowes with me, and ye shull be in feliship of these worthi

hervy, "with right gode will yef it hem plese."  "Certes,"
seide the kynge, "it hem lyketh wele that ye be fro hens-forth

hervy, "for the feliship of so worthi men is not to be
refused."  Than thei lepe to horse, and gedered to-geder on a soppe; and
than Merlin toke firste the wey; and thei alle hym folowen
wheder that euer he rode.  And as thei rode in this wise as ye

Cleodalis were moche greved, for thei were at grete myschief, and
hadde so moche suffred that nere thei were turned to the flight;
but whan thei saugh come the dragon that Merlin bar, that caste
oute of his throte so grete raundon of fiere in to the aire, that
was full of duste and powder, so that it semed all reade.  And
whan the ladies vpon the walles this saugh, thei cryed alle with
oon voys, "Now, sir Cleodalis, haue mynde to do well, and
be-holde towarde the valey, and se the socour that cometh."</P><P>  Whan Cleodalis vndirstode that the ladies seiden, he
be-heilde and saugh that he hadde so moche desired.  And
whan the knyghtes that were with Cleodalis saugh this socour,
it nedeth not to aske yef thei be gladde and ioyfull.  Than
Cleodalis dide renne to the saisnes, bothe he and his peple, for to
lete hem vndirstonde that thei hadde counfort; and be-gonne
freshly vpon hem as it hadde be at the comencement.  And these
other com ridinge a softe pase till thei com as nygh as the caste

CCC at the firste shoffe in theire comynge; and many ther were
that neuer roos after.  And than thei plonged in a-monge hem so
depe, and neuer thei stynted till thei come to the baner of Cleodalis.</P><P>  And whan thei were there alle assembled, than cryed Merlin,
"Lordinges!  worthy knyghtes!  now let see youre
cheualrye, for now be ye come to the assay."  whan the kynge
Arthur vndirstode the wordis of Merlin, he seide to kynge Boors
and to kynge Ban, laughinge, that neuer hadde ther be so fyn an
olde man.  And Merlin ther-with cried, "Lete be your Iapes,
for all this woke more ye shull haue leiser to laugh and to

enmyes wroth and matelentif; ther was tho a merveilouse stour
and creuwell, and encresed more and more than it hadde do all
the day be-fore.  Ther dide the kynge Arthur wonderes, for as
the boke   <MILESTONE N="76a" UNIT="folio"/>seith, so he labored by the entycement of Merlin, that
all peple hym be-heilde for the merveile.  And Gonnore, the

hym fro deth and pereile, and wepten for pitee of the traueyle
that thei suffred; and ther-to thei merveillede that so yonge a
man myght that endure, and namely the kynge Arthur more
than eny other, for he smote with Calibourne his gode swerde on
euery side; for he smote of handes, and armes, and heedes, and
thyes; and he smote down knyghtes, and horse, and men; he
made sheeldes shiver fro nekkes, and helmes from hedes, that the
serkeles fly a-sonder, and hadde euer goode wardeyns a-boute
hym, that gretly hym helped in eche nede; for full noble men
were the two kynges that ben in his companye, ffor a-geyns hem
myght noon armoure endure, ne presse, were it neuer so grete,
but that thei it brake with trenchaunt swerdes; and so dide wele
thoo prise knyghtes in her companye, and also the knyghtes of
the rounde table, that ne ought not to be for-yeten.  Ffull harde
and stronge bataile was be-fore the yates of Toraise, and many
feire chivalryes shewed on the oo parte and on the tother, and
dured all the day, and was so nygh the walles of the town that a
man myght haue caste a ston a-monge hem vpon here helmes.</P><P>  Whan sorfarin saugh how he hadde so moche loste of his
peple, he swore by his creaunce that he wolde neuer
departe thens till he hadde done hem as grete damage.  Than he
called Sortebran, and Clarion, and Gaidon, and Senebant, and
malore, and ffreelant, alle these were his kynnes-men, and bolde
knyghtes and hardy, and than he seide to hem, "Now be it sene who
is a knyght."  Than soche ix knyghtes that were grete and huge,
ran in a-monge the cristen as faste as the horse myght hem bere,
and Sorfarin smote hervy the rivell so rudely that he fill of his
horse to grounde, and after he smote Antor that he fill to the
erthe, bothe he and his horse on an hepe, and after he smote
Gifflet thourgh the side that he fill to the erthe wounded all
blody, and eche of his felowes bar oon to the grounde, but ther
nas noon that was wounded to deth; and of these that fellen
was lucas the botiller, that oon, and Meranges a-nother, and
Gosnayns Cardus, and Grires de lamball, and Gosnayn de strangot,
and the ixe was Bretell, and alle these fill by stroke of spere for
defaute of horse.  Than a-rose a grete showte, and the duste so

thikke that vnethe myght oon see a-nother, for the saisnes rested
alle vpon hem, that gretly hem peyned hem for to slee; but thei
were delyuer and hardy and lepten vp on foote, and theire swerdes
naked in theire hondes, and deffended hem right harde, but thei
were so many and so thikke, and ther-to sought vpon hem so
straitely; but litill it hem a-vailed   <MILESTONE N="76b" UNIT="folio"/>whan Merlin com to socoure,
and the baner in his honde; and Sorfarin, that moche hym peyned
hem to do damage, smote so the kynge leodogan thourgh the
shelde, and he bar his spere so lowe that he hurte hym in the
flanke, and to grounde yede bothe the kynge and his horse, the
toon vpon the tother.  And when thei in the town saugh the
kynge falle, thei hadde grete drede lest he were slain, and
ther-with thei pressed fercely to the rescue.  Whan the kynge Arthur
saugh the Geaunt so Iuste that iiij so noble men hadde
ouer-throwen, he swore that he wolde hym assayen.  Than he rode
oute of the renge, and caught a grete spere with an hede
trenchaunt, and rode a grete walop, and the kynge Ban com hym
a-gein and seide, "Sir, what will ye do, ne Iusteth not a-gein this
grete Geaunte, for he is to stronge for yow that be so yonge and
so tender to take soche and entirprise, but lete me goo that am
more growen and of more strengthe than be ye."  Qoud Arthur,
"Than God helpe neuer yef I sende eny othir than my-self, for
the more that he is to doute, the rather I will hym assaien, ffor
I shall not elles knowe my self but I assay hym at this
tyme."  </P><P>And whan Merlin saugh that he dide a-bide, he cried lowde,
"What, coward, wher-fore a-bideste thow?  whi doste thow
not that thow haste vndirtaken, for it is sene that thow arte
a-ferde."  Whan Arthur vndirstode how Merlin cleped hym
cowarde, he was sore a-shamed of that he hadde seide, and smote
the horse with the spores in to the renges.  And the kynge Ban
seide to Merlin that he hadde don euell whan so yonge a man as
is the kynge Arthur sholde be sente to Iuste a-gein so gret a
deuell.  "No force," qoud Merlin, "he shall do right wele;
but take a spere, and folowe after, ye and youre brother and
Vlfin."  And thei dide as he badde, and rode after Arthur as
faste as the horse myght hem bere.  And whan the kynge

Sorfarin saugh Arthur come, he com hym a-geins full fercely;
and whan thei in the renges saugh hym come so a-gein Arthur,
that was so yonge and litell to hym, thei stynte alle, and hadde
grete drede for hym.  And thei ronne with all the might that
the horse myght yelde, and smote to-geder with speres so grete
strokes vpon the sheldes that thei made hem breke and perce;
and the stiell of the speres stynte at the haubrekes, that were
stronge and sore-holdynge.  Sorfarins brake his spere but a
litill; he wounded the kynge Arthur in the lifte flanke; and
Arthur smote hym a-gein so sore that he perced the shelde and
the haubreke that the shafte shewed thourgh the chyne be-hynde
an arme lengthe; and he shof so rudely that he bar hym from
his horse to the erthe vp-right; and he passed forth with-oute
more styntynge, and the spere fly on peces that no lenger myght
sustene.</P><P>  This Iustinge saugh Gonnore, the doughter of kynge leodogan,
that was at the windowes in the paleise that ioyned to the
walles of the town, and she preised moche the yonge knyght, and
asked of hem that were a-boute her what he was; but thei ne
cowde not sey,   <MILESTONE N="77a" UNIT="folio"/>saf that he was oon of the sowdiours that her
fader hadde with-holden.  "Trewly," seide the mayden,
"what-so-ever he be, hym semeth that he is come of high lynage; ffor
no man of lowe berthe durste not vndirtake no soche dedes, but
yef it com of high herte; and he and these worthi men ther haue
this day don many faire dedes of armes."  Longe tyme heilde
this mayden her tale of the sowdiours.  And the kynge ban and
the kynge Boors were in the renges, and ech of hem a grete
spere.  Than thei smote theire horse with the spores, and the
kynge Ban smote Sortebran, and the kynge Boors smote Clariel,
and Vlfin smote Iaisdon; and ech of these thre bar his felow to
the erthe deed fro theire horse; and with the same cours oon
smot moras, and a-nother hitte laidon, and the thirde Senebant
so sore, that deed thei moste nede be er thei myght oute of the
feilde.  And the kynge Arthur drough oute his swerde, and
smote so malore vpon the helme that was restinge vpon the
kynge Ban, ffer he and frelent were besy to smyte of his heed,


<EPB/><PB N="223" ID="pb.223"/>

ffor that oon heilde hym by the helme, and the tother smote hym
be-twene the shulderes with a grete axe.  And whan Arthur
saugh this he hasted thider with his swerde in his honde, and
smote so harde malore that the heed fill in to þe felde.
  </P><P>Whan ffreelent saugh his felowe deed, that was his cosin, he
toke the axe with bothe handes, and reised it for to
smyte the kynge Arthur vpon the helme.  And he kepte the
stoke vpon his shelde, but the stroke com so harde that it fill fro
hym in to the feilde; and the stroke descended vpon his lefte
sholder so sore that he bente on his horse nekke.  And Geaunt
reised his axe to recouer a-nother stroke, but Arthur was ther-of
ware, and smote the horse with the spores and passed forth, and
than returned with his swerde, and smote so ffreelent with soche
myght that he slyt hym to the teth.  And than a-roos the showte
and the noyse of the saisnes, that sore were affraide of that
encounter, and saugh that thei hadde no more socoure but of
Randoul, that bar here baner.  And the kynge Ban smote so
Randoul that the arme fill fro the body, and the baner anoon fill
to the erthe.  Than a-roos a showte and so grete noyse that alle
thei tho turned to flight, and the chase be-gan that longe endured,
for from euensonge it lasted vn-to nyght; and ther was grete
occision, for of the ix<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> ne lefte but iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, that fledde to siege to
kynge Rion, and tolde hym the losse and damage that thei
hadde resceyved, and the grete mortalite that vpon hem was
turned.  And whan the kynge it herde, he swor his oth that
neuer he wolde departe oute of the londe till that he hadde take
the kynge leodogan and put hym in prison.</P><P>  Than he sente in to the londe of Denmarke that alle high
barouns sholde come to hym, and brynge with hem plente
of vitaile for two hundred thowsande men for two yere, for he
seide now he wolde encrese his werre more vigerously than ever
he hadde don   <MILESTONE N="77b" UNIT="folio"/>be-fore.  And thei com and assembled euery day
that in shorte tyme were ther with hym assembled CC l.<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>; and at
this assemble were xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> kynges crowned; and the kynge Rion
hym-self was the twentithe kynge.  And with hem com huge
carriage of vitaile oute of alle parties, wher-with the hoste was

stuffed, that thei rode not on forroy for no vitaile, ffor grete
plente thei hadden of the londes of the xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> kynges that weren
in the hoste; and ofte tymes thei assailed the Citee, that was
right stronge, that nothynge ne dowted, saf only for famyn.
And thei sente to kynge leodogan for socour, that he sholde come
hem to helpe, for sore were thei greved.  But now resteth the
tale of kynge Rion, and of his seige that was grete, and of hem
that were in the Citee of Daneblaise, and returne for to speke of
kynge Arthur and of his companye.</P><P>  Now seith the booke that gladde and ioyfull were thei of the
town of Toraise for the discounfiture of the saisnes, that
were chased of so small a peple, for thei were at the bygynnynge
but vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> and iij hundred, and the saisnes were more than xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>,
and were discounfited be the counseile of Merlin, that moche
hem helped, and by the knyghtes of the rounde table, and also
of the xlij sowdioures.  And, as the booke seith, whan thei
hadde chased the saisnes vnto nyght, that than thei returned to
Toraise gladde and mery, and fonde the kynge in the town, that
his men hadde remounted, and sette on horse.  And whan he
knewe that the sowdiours com, he wente hem ageins, and made
of hem the grettest ioye that eny man myght, and founde Antor
and Gifflet, and kay, and lucas the botiller, and alle the other
felowes hool and sounde, of whom thei hadden had grete drede
that thei hadden be deed or elles taken.  And there was founde
grete wynnynge; and the kynge made it to be take and
presented to the sowdiours that he hadde with-holden.  And he
seide he myght it no better employe, for thei hadde it alle
wonne; "and my-self," seide the kynge leodogan, "haue thei
rescued fro deth and fro prison."</P><P>  And whan thei saugh the grete worschip that the kynge hem
dide, thei thanked hym hertely, and seide that thei
wolde it not, for in tyme comynge thei resceve his yeftes and
take of hym other fee.  And the kynge seide, seth thei wolde it
not resceyve that thei sholde it departe, and yeve ther as thei
wolden.  Than com Merlin to the thre kynges, <CORR SIC="and and">and</CORR>   bad hem take

it; and thei it token, and yaf it ther as Merlin hem assigned,
that thei ne lefte not to hem-self the valewe of a peny.  And
thei that it hadden, thanked and preised moche the sowdiours, alle
tho that hem knewen, and also thei knewe hem no-thynge; and
that so moche were thei be-loved in the contrey for her largesse
be the counseile of Merlin, that nought was spoken of in the
contrey but of the sowdiours.  And the kynge Arthur yaf so
moche to his Ooste and to his wif of horse, and palfreyes, and
robes,   <MILESTONE N="78a" UNIT="folio"/>that alle thier lyves after were thei riche.</P><P>  Whan the kynge Arthur hadde departed the richesse that
was wonne of the saisnes, thei entred in to the town;
and the kynge leodogan wolde not suffre hem in no wise to
a-light but at his paleise with hym, ne neuer after wolde he lete
hem be oute of his companye, and with the knyghtes of the
rounde table.  And whan thei were vn-armed, the kynge made
his doughter to aray hem in riche robes, and made her take
warme water in basyns of siluer, and bare to the thre kynges and
hem serue; but Arthur wolde not take her seruyse till that the
kynge leodogan and Merlin commaunded hym and made hym to

sore what he myght be, and grete desire he hadde for to knowe
the trowthe what he was, and thought in his herte that "and it
were pelesynge to god that he hadde my doughter spoused, for
trewly I can not thynke that so high prowesse myght be shewed
in soche a childe, but yef he were come of right high lynage,
other elles I trowe that it be som spirituell man that god hath
me sente for to deffende this reame, nought for me but for
Cristynte and holy cherche to mayntene;" and ther-to he seide ne
yede he not oute of this town with-oute leve of the porter.</P><P>  At this soper the kynge leodogan sat stille in a grete stodye,
and lasted longe, and it fill in his mynde how that he
hym rescued in the depe valay with the xlj felowes a-gein v C
knyghtes, that ledde hym to prison, and remembrede alle the
  <MILESTONE N="78b" UNIT="folio"/>prowesses that he hadde sein hym do, and so sadly he sat in that
thought that alle thei were troubled, and lefte theire mete.  Of
this was war hervy de ryvel, and was ther-fore sory in his herte,
and a-roos and yede to hym full wroth to the heede of the table,
and seide, "Sir, I saugh neuer yow so mys-take youre-self, ne
neuer I saugh yow so a-baisshed, ffor ye ought well to make ioye
to these worthi men; and ye thenke as that ye were in a dreme,
and I merveile moche of youre grete wisdome where it is
be-come."  Than the kynge yaf a grete sigh, and loked on hervy,
and seide "Hervy, frende, I thought vpon the most worthi man
of the worlde, fro the whiche I myght not me with-drawe; and
yef thow knewe what my dought were thow woldest not me
blame."  And he seide, "Sir, it may well be so, but now at this
tyme cesseth till efte-sones, for this is no place now ther-to, but
maketh ioye to these barouns and disporte yow, for ye haue at this
tyme to moche yow mystaken saue youre honoure."  "Gramercy,
feire frende," seide the kynge, "I knowe well that I haue
mysdon."  Then hervy yede, and satt down by his felowes; and
the kynge tho spake to the barouns merily.  And the maiden

that was the doughter of kynge leodogan serued Arthur vpon
her kne of wyne with hir fader cuppe.  And Arthur hir be-heilde
full debonerly, and plesed hym wele that he saugh hir so nygh,
ffor she was the feirest lady that was in all Breteigne in that
tyme; and the mayden was fayre, and hadde on hir heede a
riche chapelet of preciouse stones, and her visage fressh and wele
colowred, so entermedled white and reade so naturally that it
neded nother more ne lesse, and her shulderes streyghte and
euen, and merveylously well shapen of body, for she was sklender
a-boute the flankes and the haunche lowe and comly well sittynge,
and of alle fetures the feirest shapen that myght be founde in eny
londe; and yef she hadde grete bewte ther-to she hadde as moche
bounte of valour, of curtesie, and nurture.</P><P>  Whan Arthur saugh this mayden that hadde so grete bewte,
he be-heilde her with a gladde chere, and saugh her
pappes smale and rounde as two smale appelis that were harde;
and her flessh whitter than snowe, and was not to fatte ne to
sklender; and he coveyted her gretly in his herte, that he waxe
all pensif, and lefte his mete, and turned his chere a-nother wey,
for he wolde not the two kynges ne noon other hym
a-perceyved.  Than the mayden profered hym the cuppe, and seide, "Sir,
drynke, and <CORR SIC="dispelse">displese</CORR>   yow not, though I clepe yow not be youre
name, and be ye not a-baisshed at youre sopere, for at armes ye do
not faile at no nede, and well it shewed this day, where ye were
be-holden of v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, that nothynge yow dide knowe but by

gramercy of youre seruyse; and god graunte me power that I
may yow this guerdon yelde."  "Sir," seide she, "ye haue quyte
  <MILESTONE N="79a" UNIT="folio"/>it double more than I may deserue, ffor ye haue rescued my
lorde my fader, ye and youre companye, that was a-monge so many
of his enmyes that ledde hym to prison."  And he satte stille
with-oute ansuere.  "And," quod the lady, "was ther moche
more, for here be-fore the yates at the brigge foote ye shewed
well sembelant that it yow greued, and that ye were sory for his

vndir hym slayn, for ye slow hym that hym dide ouerthrowe, and
ye youre-self were in auenture of deth hym to rescuen, and so
wele ye dide that thei were fayn to leve the feelde."</P><P>  Thus spake the doughter of kynge leodogan to Arthur, but he
spake no worde a-gein, but toke the cuppe and dranke
with goode will, and after commaunded the mayden to a-rise, for to
longe hadde she kneled, but the kynge her fader ne wolde
not.  Thus were thei serued right highly of alle thynges that man
myght devise.  And whan the clothes sholde be taken vp the
kynge ban seide to kynge leodogan that satte next by hys side,
"Sir," seide the kynge Ban, "I haue grete merveile of yow that
be so wise and worthy a man that haue not maried youre doughter
to som high prynce that myght yow helpe in youre werres, ffor
she is now wele woxen and ther-to right wise; and as me semeth
ye haue no mo heyres to whom youre londe shall descende after
youre deth, and therfore ye sholde here be-fore haue her sette to
some noble prynce."  "Certes, sir," seide leodogan, "I haue be
letted by the werre that me sore hath greved and longe dured,
ffor it is vij yere passed that the kynge Rion of Denmarke and of
Irelonde ne cessed neuer vpon me to werre; ne neuer seth com
ther no man in this londe to whom I ought hir to yeve; but, so
helpe me god, yef I myght fynde a yonge bacheler that were a
worthi man of armes that myght wele endure peyne and trauayle
to meyntene my werre, To hym wolde I yeve my doughter yef he
wolde her take, and alle my londe after my desesse, that neuer

that it plesed oure lorde Ieshu that it myght ben he that I thynke

withynne these thre dayes vnto a feire yonge bacheler that is full of
high prowesse, and trewly I suppose in my corage that he be of
hiher astate than am I."  And Merlin be-heilde the kynge Boors
and be-gan to smyle, and made hym a signe that it was seide for
the kynge Arthur, and with-oute faile for hym was it seide.</P><P>  Than be-gonne thei to speke of many thynges, and turned her
tales other weyes, for more wolde thei not speke ther-of
at that tyme.  That perceyvede well the kynge leodogan that

thei heilde no cure to mayntene that tale, and ther-with he yaf
a sore sigh, for fayn he wolde that oon hadde hym more ther-of

  <MILESTONE N="79b" UNIT="folio"/>made to Arthur, and that was a thynge that brought hym more
mys-ese, and so moche the worthy men of the rounde table more

saugh hadde ther-of merveile, and weren a-basshed; but a-bove
alle hym coveyted the kynges doughter, and right hertely she
hym loved, and mused here-on so moche that she was sore
troubeled, and fayn wolde she haue hym to be her lorde, and
make a-bove alle tho that euer she hadde seyn be-fore; and the
storyes seyn that she was the wisest lady of all the bloy breteyne,
and the feirest and the beste be-loved that euer was in the londe

"right moche I desire to wite, yef it yow plese."  Than seide
Merlin, "I do yow to wite that thei haue had stronge bataile
be-fore logres in the playn a-gein the saisness, that all the contrey

Merlin, "of youre londe, for thei shull it well deffende in to the

that be at logres, and what be their names?"  "Sir," quod
Merlin, "that oon is cleped Gawein, and the tother Agravayn,

not at this tyme.  And the kynge Tradilyuaunt rode in to North
wales with vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men that were hym be lefte of the bataile; and
the kynge Aguysanx rode to malohaut <CORR SIC="wit">with</CORR> vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and after
toke his messagers, and sente to the lordes as he hadde seide to
the kynge Tradilyuant.</P><P>  Whan the kynge Aguysans was come to his Citee of
Corenges in Scotlonde, he assembled his peple on
horsebak and on foote, that he hadde xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  And it fill on a
monday in the morowe that the saisnes were more than xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and
rode be-twene Corenges and lanneriur, and brandons a-gains the
pray that Oriels, and meniadus, and Sorbaries, and margoires, and
brandons, and Poigeres, and pyncenars, and Salubrius, and
magloras, and Gondoffles the grete, diden condite towarde the
hoste be-fore Valdesbiry; and as thei come, <CORR SIC="the">thei</CORR> brent and
distroyde all the londe, and brent bourghs, and townes, and
castelles, and sette all on fier and flame, as thei that all the
londe wolde haue brought to nought; and ther-to thei made so
grete martire of peple thourgh the contrey, that ye myght haue
hadde grete pite were youre herte neuer so harde, for ladies and
maidenes that thei slowen and her childeren in her armes; and
ther as the mene peple were fledde in to caves for socour, thei
putt in fier, and brent hem ther-ynne; and the tidinges ran so
thourgh the contrey that the kynge aguysanx it herde; and than
he comaunded alle his barouns to armen hem; and thei dide his
comaundement, and lepe to horse, and rode two myle er day; and
than thei rode forth a softe pas till it was passed pryme.  Than
thei loked towarde lanneriur, and saugh the eyr trouble, and
thikke of duste, and flames of fier that thei hadde sette in the
contrey, and herde the noyse and the cry that the peple made
of her losse and damage, and for her frendes þat thei saugh
martired be-fore her yen; and thei ther-fore were full anguysshouse, 

<EPB/><PB N="237" ID="pb.237"/>

and rode forth a grete spede, and were well xiiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>; and
hem condited the kynge Anguysans in the formest fronte with
vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, that were yonge bachelers and hardy.  This Gaudius was
cosin germain to Aguysans on his fadir side; and he dide after
many feire chiualries be-fore the castell, for the damesell of
brulent, that he wolde haue hadde be force to his wif, <CORR SIC="and and">and</CORR>   was
be-fore the riche town that was so moche preised er that Gaudius it
conquered by his prowesse, as the storie shall telle here-after, for
it is yet no tyme ther-to, but returne to the kynge aguysans of
Scotlonde, that rode to-geder, he and Gaudius, till   <MILESTONE N="82b" UNIT="folio"/>thei fill
a-monge the forriours and a-monge the cariage; and a-noon thei
smote to-geder fercely, that ther was many oon ouerthrowen
bothe horse and man; and thei dide the saisnes grete losse of her
peple at the be-gynnynge, for thei were oute of aray and spredde
a-brode in the contrey, oon here, a-nother ther; and the kynge
aguysans and Gaudius and her peple slowe of hem moo than
vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  And whan the kynge of the saisnes com in to the bataile
where-as thei were fightynge, than was Gaudius and his
companye at grete myschef, for the saisnes were moo than xl<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, what
oon and other and of the cristen were but xiiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  Neuertheless, thei
deffended hem right longe, but euer the saisnes encresed, that it
was wonder to be-holde, for fro the bataile was but x myle fro
the hoste; and the x kynges that I yow nempned com on
the tother side wele horsed and armed with so grete plente
of peple that all the contrey was couered on euery side,
and thei drof the cristin a-wey whether thei wolde or
noon.  Ffull grete losse hadde ther the kynge Aguisans, and grete
damage of his knyghtes and of his men, ffor er none was
passed the saisnes mette hem so sharply that of xiiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> that he
brought in his companye ne myght he not assemble vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> that alle
ne were dede or taken, and ne hadde be oon a-venture that fill,
ther hadde neuer of hem ascaped oon a-wey; but the kynge Vrien
was comen oute in the morowe for the hete, he and his nevew
Bandemagn, that was a noble knyght and an hardy and sure,


<EPB/><PB N="238" ID="pb.238"/>

and lefte Ewein his sone in the Citee, that was a feire chielde and
of high prowesse, that hadde be-geten on Arthurs suster, that
was so goode a lady a-gein god and also to the worlde.  With
Ewein also was Meliagans, that at that tyme was a young childe,
and was the sone of Bandemagn by his firste wif.  These two
childeren kepte the Citee right wele, but knyghtes were thei
noon, for thei were to yonge of age; and with hem also was
Ewein a-voutres, that was the kynges sone Vrien be the stiwardes
wif, that was of grete bewte; and therfore the kynge lefte his
<CORR SIC="owe">owne</CORR> wif more than fyve yere, and kepte her in his house maugre
his stiwarde till that he hadde this childe.  Whan that the childe
was born ther rose so grete a scentence of cursinge that he most
nedes leve her wheþer that he wolde or noon; but the childe he
kepte and norisshed till it was feire well woxen and that he myght
ride after to court; and the kynge that loved hym moche in his
herte yaf hym of his londe grete plente, that he myght wele
mayntene goode meyne a-boute hym.  This Ewein, that was geten in
advoutry, was gentill and curteyse and full of hardynesse, and for
the grete love that the kynge hadde to hym, he brought hym
forth in the companye of his son Ewein the grete; and for that
he was geten in a-vouterye was he cleped Ewein the a-vouteres,
and the tother, that was his right heir be his wif, was cleped
Ewein the more; and this Ewein was a passinge feire childe
and bolde and hardy; but after that he hadde herde speke of
kynge Arthur he wolde not suffre that noon made hym knyght;<MILESTONE N="83a" UNIT="folio"/>
  ne his fader, ne noon other, but seide ofte to his counseile and
that was to Ewein his brother that he loved moche, and was
yonger than he; and he tolde hym that he wolde neuer be
knyght till that the kynge Arthur, his Oncle, yaf hym the
ordere, and girde the swerde be hys syde; and the tother Ewein
seide that right so wolde he do.  Thus lefte thei for to kepe the town,
and the kyng Vrien and Bandemagn hem spedde so till that thei
com to the bataile euen as the kynge aguysanx was discounfited,
and was merveillously sorowfull.  Ne noon myght telle the
maltalent that he hadde, and that after he shewde well semblant,
for as soone as it come to the chase he smote a-monge the saisnes


<EPB/><PB N="239" ID="pb.239"/>

so fiercely as a wode lyon; and he was wele horsed as to soche a
man be-longeth, and hadde in his companye x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men that were
wele horsed.  Than were the saisnes ascride a-lowde and harde
I-smyten.  Ther fill many in swowne that neuer after a-roos;
ffull sharp and crewell was this stour, for the meyne that com
with kynge Vrien were full profitable and hardy, and foughten
all the day longe, and suffred grete travaile.  And the kynge
Aguysans wente in to his Cite disconfited, ffor the chace lefte of
hym for to fight with the kynge vrien and his peple; and ther
was grete slaughter of men and of horse bothe, for neuer so small
a peple made so grete occision.  But longe the kinge vrien and
his men ne myght not endure, ffor a-gein hem were so grete foyson
of peple that hem nothinge ne spared, but dide hem the greef
that thei myght with all theire power; but the nyght com that
made hem departe.  And the kynge vrien wente to Sorhan, he
and his peple, alle for brosed and full wery of trauayle and of
strokes that thei hadde yeuen and resceyved; but the saisnes
lefte in the place ther the bataile hadde I be, and laye that
nyght stille armed; but to the kynge vrien com a feire a-venture
that ought not to be for-yeten in the tale, for he fonde a rowte of
saisnes in a launde a-boute mydnyght, that ledde grete richesse
towarde the hoste of vitaile, and also of other harneyse, as robes
and money and bestes, and were well iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> that these richese dide
condite; and thei were sette to theire soper with grete foyson of
vitaile, and wende to haue hadde no drede of no man, ffor thei
knewe well the disconfiture of hem and the kynge Aguysanx,
and therfore were thei deseuered fro the grete companye for the
hastier spede, and for to come the soner to the siege that was
be-fore the town of valdesbery.</P><P>  Whan the kynge vrien and Bandemagn, his nevew, saugh
the saines in this manere, and the teintes and pavelons
that thei hadde pight, and the gret light that was with-ynne the
pavilouns, thei made a-noon to aske what peple it were; and thei
that were with-ynne the pavylouns a-noon ansuerde, and seide
thei were with the kynge Brangore of Saxon.  Whan the kynge
vrien and Bandemagn, his nevew, herde that thei were saisnes

<EPB/><PB N="240" ID="pb.240"/>

that thei hadde founden, thei cried "as armes;" and her peple
seide,   <MILESTONE N="83b" UNIT="folio"/>"Now as armes, for now it shall be preved who is goode
and who is cowarde."  And thei sette vpon hem, and founde hem
vn-armed, and therfore was in hem but pore deffense; and <CORR SIC="the the">the</CORR>  
cristen be-gonne to ouerthrowe pavylouns vpon her heedes, and on
her mete.  Ther sholde ye haue sein grete trouble of tables
downcaste and the vitaile I-spredde wide, and cuppes and pecys of
siluer and bordclothes and towayles vnder the horse feet, but ther
was grete occision of saisnes that the cristin peple hem dide, that
hem hated of mortuall hate; and as the storie seith, that the cristin
were yet viij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and  of the saisnes ne were but iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and alle
vn-armed, as thei that were sette at soper, and wende not to haue
hadde no drede.  And the nyght was feire and clere, and a softe
weder in the myddill of Aprill.  And the saisnes were so hewen
and martired in shorte tyme that of the iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml </HI1>ascaped not xl, and
that ne were slain with speres, and swerdes, and axes; and thei
that ascaped ronne in to wodes and in to grete forestes, and made
so grete sorowe that no man cowde telle.  And whan the saisnes
were thus disconfited and fledde, the kynge vrien and his peple
gedered vp that was lefte ther of the saines that was grete
richesse, and wente the right wey to Sorhant with-oute eny
other distrubier, and were gladde and mery after the aventure
that was hem be-fallen.</P><P>  After that the kynge vrien and Bandemagn were departed
fro the bataile, as ye haue herde, ther com tydinges how
that Gawein, and Agrauain, and Gaheret, and Gaheries, and
Galashin were departed from theire faders so yonge childeren for
to be made knyghtes with-oute takynge leve, and were goynge to
logres for to take her armes of the kynge Arthur; but thei haue
hym not founden, for he was gon in to the reame of Tamelide;
and the childeren were lefte at logres, and kepte right wele the
marches, and seiden thei wolde neuer remeve thens till theire
oncle were come home, and also how thei hadden gete the richest
prise that euer was sein in her comynge.  And so these tydinges


<EPB/><PB N="241" ID="pb.241"/>

ronne thourgh the londe that Ewein herde speke ther-of, that was
Arthur suster sone; and than he seide to his moder in prive
counseile, "Ffeire moder, my cosins beth gon to the court of
kynge Arthur hym for to serue, and for to take theire armes of
hym; and we ne mowe not be in no gretter myschef than we

that I sholde do, ffor in no manere will I do no thinge that sholde
yow displese; and ye knowe wele that my fader hath yoven his
londe that be com on his syde to Bandemagn, his nevew, after
his discesse, in the tyme of Vterpendragon, and he may no more
thynge fro me be-reve what wratth that euer I haue of hym, for
the londe that cometh of youre be-halue ne may I not lese, but
yef it be youre will; and though I lese all I will go with my

with worship, for   <MILESTONE N="84a" UNIT="folio"/>how-so-euer that it be I will go, for I haue

sey me lightly what is youre pleiser."</P><P>  Whan the lady herde Ewein her sone so speke, she be-gan
to wepe for ioye and for pitee, ffor well she knewe
that the herte com fro the high lynage on hir syde, and seide,
"Ffeire some Ewein, wher haue ye take that talent and that
herte for to leve me and to serue another?"  And he ansuerde,
"Ha, dame!  for goddes love, mercy!  I reporte me to all the
worlde, and my herte also telleth me, that he is youre brother and
myn oncle, and also my cosins beth go in to his londe, and
therfore were I a grete cowarde to a-bide here, where as I may no

I will go; and now ordeyne so for me that I may go in soche
that it be youre worship and myn."  "Ffeire sone," seide the
lady, "a-bide a-while, and I shall a-paraile yow so prively that
youre fader shall it not wite, for and he it wiste, all youre iourney
were loste; and gete yow soche felship as ye will haue, and I
shall purveye for horse and armes, and robes and money I-nowgh

he com to his brother Ewein a-voutres, and discouered to hym his

seide that he sholde neuer go in to no strange londe with-oute
hym yef god wolde, and that he was redy to move what tyme
that euer he wolde.  Quod Ewein, "I will that we departe
withynne these viij dayes."  And with that the bretheren departed,
and made hem redy; and Ewein the a-voutres so purchased as he
that was manly and wise, that he hadde in his companye an
hundred felowes, and Ewein the more hadde CC; and his moder
hym ordeyned robes, and money, and horse, and armure grete
plente.  And on an euenynge after soper thei departed a-boute
mydde-nyght, at the firste cok crowinge, by leve of the lady;
and hem condited ffragien, a yonge gentilman, that knewe alle
the estres of the forestes and the weyes; but now of hem resteth
the tale, and returned to speke of kynge ventres of Garlot.</P><P>  Whan the kynge Ventres of Garlot vndirstode that he hadde
loste his sone Galashin, he was right hevy and wroth,
and in especiall toward his wif Basyne, so that he spake not to
hir all a moneth nother goode ne badde.  Than fill it on a
thursday at even in the moneth of Aprille, in the tyme that these
erbes and trees be-gynne to florissh, and the briddes singen with
ther voys for the swetnesse of the newe mery seson, that a
messanger com and tolde hym the grete distruxion where-as the
kynge Aguysanx hadde I-be, and how the saisnes hadde hym
disconfited, and how that he hadde be deed or take, ne hadde be
the kynge vrien that com hym   <MILESTONE N="84b" UNIT="folio"/>for to socour, wher-fore the
chase sessed of the kynge Aguysanx; and after com a-nother
messager, that tolde hym of the grete distruxion of the saisnes
that the kynge Tradyliuant and the kynge de cent chiualers hadde
don be-twene Randoul and the roche, where-as thei hadde riche
enprise.  And whan the kynge ventres herde these tydinges he
was right hevy for the distresse of the kynge Aguysanx, and on
the tother side he was right gladde of the kynge Tradilyuaunt
and of the kynge de Cent chiualers, than he be-thought in hys

and Sorloys, where-as the passage was right grete; but he hadde
not longe be in this stodye whan in his owne contrey he herde so
grete noyse and clamor of peple that fledde on euery side.</P><P>  A noon the kynge lete aske what the peple eiled.  And thei
seide that alle the saisnes of the worlde were entred in to
his londe, and brente, and distroied, and slowgh alle that thei
myght atteyne.  And ther-to ther was of hem so grete
multitude that it was merveile, and were loigged vpon the river of
sourne be-fore the castell of brolende in the medowes; and ther

kynge Magondes, that was cosin to Aungis; and the kynge

heere and see.  And whan the kynge ventres saugh his londe thus
turne to distruxion, he knewe wele that he myght not a-bide
longe with-out grete damage.</P><P>  A noon the kynge cryed with high voys, "Gentill knyghtes,
now as armes, for now shall be shewed youre
worthynesses, ffor he nys no knyght that will not deffende his londe and

and so in trouthe he was a noble knyght, and right nygh cosin to

come fleynge, and spedde hym so that he com ther as thei made
the martire and the Occision of the peple, and were in the
formest frounte v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>; but thei were not alle in array, for thei
were spredde a-brode in the contrey down by the river, that brent
and robbed.  And whan dorilas saugh with his iye that thei
dide so grete damage that were soche mysbelevynge peple, he
rode vpon hem full Irously.  And whan he com nygh bothe he
and his men lete reine as faste as the horse myght hem bere, and

smote hem so with sharp speres and trenchaunt, that many of the
saisnes   <MILESTONE N="85a" UNIT="folio"/>ther-with were throwe to grounde, and many slayn, ffor
thei were so supprised that thei were not ware till thei were ynne
a-myd monge hem that thei slowgh of hem more than two partes
er the kynge ventres was come; and the remenaunt turned to
flight in to the hoste of briolors, where as the iiij kynges were
loged.  And dorilas hem enchased and slough and martired, and
dide hem gret turment; and whan he hadde hem pursude to the
tentes and the pauylouns, and it was noone passed of the day, and
whan the saisnes saugh hem so fle, thei ronne to armes, but for
all theire haste thei myght not be so soone armed er ther were v<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1>
tentes and pavilouns ouer-throwen vpon theire hedes, and moo
than a thousande me slayn.</P><P>  Than thei be-gonne to blowe hornes and trompes nexte to the
teinte of kynge Margondre, and ther assembled and
gadered so grete plente of peple that thei were more than
xxx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  And than rode the iiij kynges; and it fill that thei mette first
with the kynge Galagnes with iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men or moo, and mette with
dorilas, that moche hym peyned to greve the saisnes, and hadde
right wele do all the day; and heilde stronge spere that he hadde
take from a saisne.  And as sonne as dorilas and Maglans saugh
ech other, thei lette renne and mette to-geder so sore vpon the
sheldes that thei perced, and the haubrekes were stronge that no
maile ne brake, but the speres splyndered on peces; and thei
passed thourgh and hurteled to-geder so harde with the horse
myght that bothe fill to grounde, and their horse vpon theire
bodies.</P><P>  Whan dorilas and Maglans thus hadde eche other
ouerthrowen, bothe partess pressed to the rescu; and ther
were many hurte, and sharpe medle ther was a stronge bataile
and grete man slaughter on bothe sithes; and with grete labour
were bothe dorilas and Maglaans horsed; but grete losse of peple
fill vpon the saisnes side, ffor thei were many of hem vn-armed,
but yet hadde thei had gretter lose ne hadde the kynge ffalsadres
come with vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, that faught with the cristin right
harde.  But the kynge ventres was a goode knyght and a sure a-bove alle


<EPB/><PB N="245" ID="pb.245"/>

that were in the feilde, ffor he dide merveilouse prowesse in
armes, and gretly he hym peyned, for he saugh the grete
nede.  And so, thourgh the helpe of god and his knyght-hode, the vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>
were discounfited and putt to flight; but as the kynge Pyngnores
com with vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> saisnes, that hem recounforted and moche
sustened, for thei smyten in a-monge the kynge Ventres meyne and
made hem to remeve more than a bowe draught from the tentes
and the pavilouns be-twene the wode and the rivere.  And whan
the kynge ventres saugh his men go in soche manere, he cried his
ensigne, and seyde, "Gentill knyghtes, whether ar ye a-wey?
returne and selle your deth while that ye may lyuen, for neuer
shull ye comen to better pointe, and ther-fore haue   in mynde
what ye be, ffor better is it for yow for to deffend youre- <MILESTONE N="85b" UNIT="folio"/>
self manly than to be slayn shamefully in flight, for as me semeth
whiche wey that we turne ther nys but deth."  And whan thei
herde her lorde thus speke thei returnede and fill to-gedir on a
companye streite and close, that noon myght entre hem
withynne but a-noon he were slain.  And thus thei hem kepte
withoute remevynge, and suffred and endured till these other vpon
hem hadde broke theire speres and till thei hadde a-gein recovered
her breth; and so a-bode theire strokes that the to-ther were
somwhat wery and thei hem-self ther-with re-freisshed; and whan
thei saugh the saisnes well chased and short wynded, thei lete
renne at hem and be-gonne to do soche maistries that the saisnes
were alle a-baisshed of the merveile that thei saugh hem
do.  And on the tother side dorilas faught so a-gein the peple of
Maglaans that he droff hem a-wey discounfited, and made hem
to rebounde vpon the warde of ffalsabres and vpon the warde of
Pyngnoras, that right sore faught agein the kynge ventres and
his peple, so that the ton smote thourgh the tothers
companye.  Ther was a stour merveilouse and stronge bataile, and dured so
longe till it was euensonge tyme.  Than meved the kynged
Margondes with grete plente of saisnes, for thei were more than xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>,
and he hadde grete dispite that so small a peple sholde endure so
longe agein so many as thei weren, for he saugh wele that thei
were not so manye by the haluendell as the saisnes.  Than Margondres


<EPB/><PB N="246" ID="pb.246"/>

 cried to his men and comaunded hem that thei sholde
sette so sore vpon the cristen that ther sholde leve noon in the
feilde a-live.  And whan the kynge ventres saugh comynge
a-gein hym so many saisnes, he gedered his men a-boute hym
close, and drough hym litill and litill towarde the foreste.  And
the saisnes hem hasted faste as thei wende haue all taken and
confounded, and vpon them they brake theire speres; and the
kynge ventres and his meyne hadde gete the wode at her bakkes
at a streite weye that was right depe, and the forest high on
bothe sithes of the wey, and so thikke that nothinge might entre
but it were wilde bestes.  And the kynge ventres and Dorilas
haue hem so spedde that thei haue their men enbusshed in that
streite passage, and pight theire speres in the erthe, and the
sharpe hede of steil vpwarde, and <CORR SIC="were were">were</CORR>   well a-raied hem to
deffende.  And the saisnes com vpon hem in grete haste full
wroth and angry for the grete damage that thei hadde don, and
assailed hem right sore; and these hem deffended right vigerously
till that it was derke nyght that vnethe myght oon se a-nother;
and more hadde the saisnes loste than wonne.</P><P>  Whan the kynge Ventres saugh the saisnes gon, than he and

</P><P>  Now seith the storye that whan the kynge Brangore was
come to Eastrangore, his stronge place, that he dide it
stuffe with knyghtes and vitaile, that he hadde of oon and other
xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men; and longe he kepte wele the marches a-boute hym
that litill harme the saisnes dide.  Till on a tyme the saisnes
were entred in to the marche of Strangore and of south walis,
where-of kynge Belynans was lorde, that was brother to the
kynge Tradilyuaunt, that have herde spoken of be-fore.  And
this Belynans was a riche kynge, and hadde a riche contrey
that was feire and esy; and his wif was a feire yonge lady of
grete bewte, and her was Esclence, and she was doughter
to kynge Natan de lille perdue, and hadde a childe be his nece
that was of grete bewte, and was xiiij yere of age, that was
cleped by his right name, Dodynell the sauage.  And the cause
whi he was cleped Dodynell was for euer was in the feeldes
and forestes for to hunte at the herte and other deer and wylde
swyn, and for he haunted it so moche ther-fore, thei cleped hym
Dodynell the sauage.  And the kynge ventres was brother to his
moder Esclence, and Galaishin was cosyn to Dodynell on his
moder syde.  This Dodynell was after in the kynge house Arthur,
and was a knyght of grete prowesse, and oon of the rounde
table, and oon of the most preised; but at this tyme we shall not
speke no more of hym, but speke of the kynge Brangore and of the
saisnes that be entred in to hys londe, and was wroth and sory for
his frendes that he hadde loste be-twene Arondell and the roche of
saisnes that heilde theire wey from wynsore be the castell of the
streyte wey; and thei were grete plente of peple; and as thei
passed thourgh the contrey thei brente, and robbed, and wasted,
and dide grete harme to the lordes of the weyes and to the
lorde of the streite marche, and to the castellein of Wyndesore,
and to the kynge Belynant of sought walis, and to the kynge
Brangore more than eny other.  And whan he wiste it he gedered
all his peple, and armed hem, and lepte to horse for to a-venge
hem of the shame and of the harme that thei hem diden.  And
the saisnes com so many and so thikke that all the contrey was
of hem covered the length of a walshe myle, that brent and slowe

com   <MILESTONE N="86b" UNIT="folio"/>ridynge with grete plente of peple till he com to the
saisnes that thus distroied the contrey and made soche martire of
the mene peple that men myght se the smolder of the fire x myle

grete martire, he toke ther-of grete pitee, and gan to
wepe watir with his iyen, and than he requerid his men to haue
in mynde to do well, and to defende holy cherche and the cristin
feith; and the saisnes com faste ridinge with baner sprad, and
were moo than fifty thousande, and hem condited Barahans, and
Cornyax, and lydarus, and hardrans, and kyngnenans.  These v
kynges were riche and myghti, and eche of hem hadde in

slough; and whan the kynge Brangore sye the grete nombre of
saisnes, he merveiled fro whens alle myght come.  And than he
gan to prey his men, and require to thynke vpon her worship and
to do well her devers, and a-bode hem at a passage at a brigge
ther thei moste come ouer that lay ouer the river of arson, that
was brode and dep?? and as soone as thei were mette, thei lete
theire horse renne, and smyten harde to-geder the toon vpon the

oon throwe to grounde bothe horse and man, and that dured longe
till that thei come to the brigge, that may fill in to the water,
and many a tronchon of speres and sheldes that the sharpe streme
bar down the ryver, and it was not fully the houre of pryme.</P><P>  The booke seith that the river ran down be-fore Strangore
that the kynge Carados helde in his baile, and he was
lenynge oute at the wyndowes of the paleise a-bove, and be-heilde
the medowes and the river, and the gardins that were grene

and he loked that wey that he saugh it come fro, and saugh the

and dought a-noon how the kynge Brangore faught with the

saisnes.  Than he lepe hastely vpon his feet, and cried to his
men, "Now as armes, gentill knyghtes, ffor he that is not hardy
at this nede is not worthi to be a knyght," and ther was a
yonge squyre that was noble and hardy that brought the kynge
his armes.  This squyer was cleped Kay destranx, this squyer
hadde ofte Carados somoned to be a knyght, and he seide that
ther-to hadde he no talent, and that he seide for he purposed to
serue the kynge Arthur, and to take of hym the ordre of
knyght.  Whan the kynge was armede, he asked yef alle the other knyghtis
were redy, and thei seide how alle were an horse bakke a-bidynge
with-oute the yates.  And than the kynge asked his horse, and
ther-on lepte and rode oute of the town a grete spede, and come
to the bataile a-boute mydday.  And whan   <MILESTONE N="87a" UNIT="folio"/>thei come nygh thei
herde the noise and the strokes at the passage of the brigge, ffor
the kynge Brangore with-stode hem with xv<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and the
saisnes were so many and so thikke that of fin force thei made
hym to remeve fro the brigge in to the playn feelde; but than
sholde soone the kynge Brangore haue hadde grete losse, but as
the kynge Carados com in fresshe with x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men and leide in

harde, and grete mortalite of the saisnes, for thei were not alle
right wele armed, and so thei foughten all the day, fro that it
was passed noone till evensonge, and than disparbled the cristin,
for thei were so sore over-leide with grete multitude of saisnes;
and than a-roos the shoute and the noise so grete, that iiij myle
of a man myght haue herde the sounde.  But longe myght not
the men of kynge Brangore ne of kynge Carados endure, but as

thei were so distrussed that thei were euen at flight; but whan
Belynans com he smote so fiercely vpon hem that these other

Belynans were many goode men and noble knyghtes, ffor ther

than com the kynge Carados, and the kynge Belynans, and the

of theire companye were come to deffende the cristin feith, ffor
ther were many full noble men and trewe that hadden grete drede

and than com tidinges that the sones of kynge loot hadde lefte

and the sone of kynge Ventres and the sones of kynge
Vrien.  And whan Dodynell herde these tithinges, he seide to hym-self
that he wolde do the same wise, and tolde to his prevy counseile
that he wolde go to court; and than he ordeyned to be redy in

the tother side thei defended so well that on hem thei gat no

and eche of hem hurte and wounded other dispiteously.  And thus
thei endured thre dayes, that neuer thei dide of haubrek ne helme

that thei knewe not where he was be-come.  And that he com
the same nyght to Blase his maister in Northumbirlonde, that
grete ioye hym made whan he hym saugh as he that loved moche

were be-fallen in the reme of Tamelide seth that he departed;
and after that he tolde hym alle thinges that were fallen to the
kynges of the reame of grete Bretaigne, that nought he lefte

tolde hym for what nede he hadde lefte the thre kynges in the

with Blase was Orienx and his meyne logged vpon the river of

in the londe was grete sorow and desese in tho dayes.  Whan the
childeren hem mette thei asked what hem eiled, and thei hem
tolde that thei fledde for the saisnes that all the contre

Arthur?"  And thei ansuerde that he was gon to the reame of
Tamelide.  "And who is than in this londe?" quod Seigramor.  Than seide
the men of the contrey that the sone of kinge loot of Orcanye,
that were nevewes of kynge Arthur, were come for to serue for to
take theire armes of kynge Arthur.  "And where ben thei?"
quod Seigramor.  "At Camelot," seide thei, "but for goddes

"telle vs what wey stondeth Camelot."  "Trewly," seiden
thei, "ye be right well in the wey, yef it ne were for these
false sarazins that here be comynge, and, ther-fore, fleeth, or

Seigramor.  "Sir, it is vj mile vnto a plain that dureth wele
two myle fro thens."  Whan Seigramor vndirstode that he
hadde but viij myle, he cried to his felowes, and seide, "Gentill

thei hem renged clos on a sop as starlinges, and rode forth toward

</P><P>  Whan Merlin hadde tolde to Blase alle the merveiles of the
londe as thei were fallen seth he departed from
hym.  In the morowe erly he com be-fore the town of Camelot.  And he
com in the semblaunce of an olde man, and hadde on a russet
cote torne and all thredebare; and he was moche and longe and
courbed, and brode sholderes and leene for age, and the heer of
his heede entermedled white and broun, and longe berde, and bar
a grete staff on his nekke, and drof gret foyson of beestes be-fore
hym.  And whan he com be-fore the town he be-gan to make
grete sorow, and cried high and cleer that thei with-ynne vpon
the walles myght wele it here how he yede, seyinge,  <MILESTONE N="91b" UNIT="folio"/> "Ha,
lorde god, how grete pite is it that so feire children shull thus be

to mayntene.  Ha, Seigramor, gentill squyer, fre and deboneir,
that thow shalt thus suffre angwissh of deth, now oure lorde god

peynes of helle, as he is very god and man full of mercy and
grace, and also to saue and helpe yowre felowes in the manere that
thus dispitousely shull be martired for defaute of socoure."  These
wordes that the carl seide, vndirstode well Gawein and his bretheren
that were vpon the walles of the town, and were alle redy armed,
and be-heilde the fier and the smoke of the saisnes as thei brente
the contrey a-boute, ffor he was come to Camelot for to kepe the
town as soone as thei wiste the saisnes were entred the contrey,
and were gon vpon the walles to see yef the saisnes come for to
assaile the town.  And Gawein hadde wele herde and vndirstonde
the wordes that the karll hadde seide.  Than Gawein hym cleped
with an high voyse, and siede, "Man! man! com hedir, and
speke with me, and tell vs what thow eylest, and whi thow
makest this sorow, and telle vs who is that that thow goist thus
regratynge and be-monynge."  And the carll leide to the deef
ere and smote his staff on the grounde as he hadde ben oute of his
mynde, for grete sorow that he hadde at his herte; and than he


<EPB/><PB N="262" ID="pb.262"/>

lenyd hym vpon his staff and be-gan to make grete sorowe; and
whan he hadde thus hym longe waymented, he drof a-gein his bestes
as though he wolde haue fledde to the forest; and than he seide
a-gein with an high voyce, "A! haa! chiualrie of logres, where
art thow be-come, ffor with-ynne these viij dayes men seide ther
was come in to this contrey all the socoure of the worlde, and I
herde sey that the nevewes of kynge Arthur sholde defende this
contrey; certeys euell it sheweth whan he suffreth to be slain the
merveile of the worlde."  Whan that Gawein vndirstode these
wordes he was right angwisshouse for to knowe whi the carll
hadde this seide, and whi he so waymented and cleped hym a-gein
with a lowde voyce thre or foure tymes, and seide, "Howe,
karll, howe? speke to me and telle me what thow eilest."  And
euer he turned the heed in trauers, and made semblant as he
hadde hym not herde; and Gawein hym cleped efte soones, and
than he lefte vp his heed that was lothly and rivelid, and loked
on high to hym with oon eye open and a-nother clos, and
grennynge with his teth as a man that loked a-gein the sonne, and
ansuerde, "What wilt thow?"  Quod Gawein, "Come a litill
nerre and speke with me."  And he drought ner till he com vndir
the walles of the town vpon the diche, and seide, "Now maist
thow sey what thow wilt,   <MILESTONE N="92a" UNIT="folio"/>but sey hastely, for my bestes gon."
"I will," quod Gawein, "that thow telle whi that thow wepest,
and what he is that thow hast thus regreted, and whi thow hast
so blamed the Chyualrie of this contrey."  "Yef thow wilt
graunte me that thow shalt do thi power to delyuer hym I will
telle the."  "I the graunte," quod Gawein, "as I am trewe
squyer, that I shall ther-to do all my myght that I haue in the
worlde."  And whan the karll herde that Gawein was so
desirouse for to wite whi he was come thider, he seide to Gawein,
"Feire sir, what be ye?"  "My name," quod he, "is Gawein,
the nevew of kynge Arthur.  Treuly I haue grete pitee of a
companye of yonge Gentilmen that beth high mennes sones that

Quod the karll, "Thei sey that the lorde of hem is cleped

come in to this contrey for to take his armes of the kynge
Arthur.  Now haue I seide all that I knowe; but I knowe it
well that ye will not hym socoure, and so I haue loste my laboure,
ffor I knewe well that ye haue not the herte ne the hardynesse
for to go thider.  Netherdeles, yef ye go thider and ye may hym

hym cleped cowarde, he was a-shamed, and cried, "Now
to horse, gentill knyghtes and gentill <CORR SIC="felowles">felowes</CORR>,   and sue me for I
go."  And as sone as he hadde seide that worde he lepe to horse
and alle his felowes after, and rode oute of the town in all haste;
and whan thei were alle oute thei were iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> what oon what
other.  And Gawein com all be-fore, and come to the karll and
seide, "Lepe vpon this horse, and lede vs ther these childeren
fighten."  Ant the karll dide his comaundement, that for noon
other thinge was come theder, and rode formest ther as thei were
fightynge; and whan thei neyhed nygh thei founde the childeren
fightinge merveilously, and hadde slain of the saisnes moo than
vijC, but ther were so many of hem that thei myght not longe
endure; and ther dide Seigramor the grettest prowesse that eny
man saught euer, ffor he heilde an axe with bothe hondes, and
was be-fore his felowes vpon a stede that was swyfte and right
stronge, ffor whan thei gan hym assaile he smote in a-monge hem
so harde and so depe that he was loste as it hadde be in a see
from the sight of his felowes; and the saisnes hym enclosed on
alle sides, and Seigramor, that heilde the ax that was sharp
I-grounde, thought to perce thourgh to his felowes, he smote so
grete strokes on bothe sides that he slowgh all that he raught a
full stroke, and thei fledde on euery side from hym that knewen
his strokes, and noon was so hardy that durst hym a-byde, but


<EPB/><PB N="264" ID="pb.264"/>

launched to hym sharpe grounde speres and gleyves and other
wepnes; but thus myght   <MILESTONE N="92b" UNIT="folio"/>thei not longe endure that thei ne
sholde haue be deed or elles taken, but as Gawein com with his
companye, ffor Orienx payned hym moche hem for to take that
was a noble knyght and a sure; and he sette vpon the
childeren and kepte hem in so short and streite that noon myght
passe, and foughten so felly that the childeren were waxen feble
for lakke of breth, and yef it ne hadde be for Seigramor only
ther hadde noon of hem ascaped.  But his defence was so grete
all a-boute hym that merveile it was how he myght it endure;
but in the ende a-vailed litill the well doynge of hym or eny
other ne hadde Gawein come soone with his companye of yonge
bachelers.  And as Gawein com to the stronge stour the
childeren were in gret mischief; and than he and his felowes spronge
vpon hem so sharply that at the first shofte thei threw of hem to
grounde mo than two thousande.  And of that was Orienx
sorowfull, ffor neuer hadde he sein so fewe peple so well hem
contene; and he heilde a stronge spere and the heed sharp
I-grounde, and rode in the renge formest, and seide he wolde be
a-venged on hem that hadde hym wratthed.  And Gawein hadde
so smyten a-boute hym on euery side that he fonde the childeren
full wery for travaile, and saugh Seigramor, that was a-fore in
the fronte, and hielde an axe in bothe handes wher-with he smote
grete strokes out of mesure.  And he was moche and semly, and
ther-to the beste shapen chielde to have sought thourgh eny
reame, and whom that he a-raught was hitte so harde that it
warant neither Iren ne stiell ne noon armour that he ne smot
thourgh owther arme or sholder or thigh or other member, and
shewde merveiles all a-boute.  And whan Gawein saugh all this
he asked of the olde man that was by hym what he was.  And
he seide it was Seigramor, the nevew of the Emperour of
Costantinnoble; but helpe hym delyuerly, for it is grete
myster.  Than Gawein renged his companye, and lete renne at hem so
fiercely that in her comynge thei threwe to grounde of the
saisnes grete plente, deed and wounded thourgh with sharpe
wepenes.  Grete was the bataile a-gein Orienx of the chylderen,


<EPB/><PB N="265" ID="pb.265"/>

but at grete myschief thei were, for on Gaweins side were but
iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> and thre hundred that Seigramor hadde brought, and of the
saisnes were xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, with-oute hem that ronne thourgh the contrey
that brente and robbed, of whiche were xl<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  Whan that Orienx
saugh that so small a peple with-stode hym so felly, he hadde
ther-of grete dispite, and cried to his men, and swor that in euell
tyme sholde eny ascape he caught, and com drivinge agein
Agrauain, that oon of his nevewes hadde slain be-fore his
iyen.</P><P>  And whan Orienx saugh that, he spored his steede and smote
Agrauain vpon the shelde, that he perced through the
plites of his haubreke vndir the side, that the spere hede shewed
on the tother side, and he shof ther-on so sore that he bar hym
from his horse to the grounde.  Whan Gawein saugh his brother
falle he hadde grete drede leste that he hadde be deed, and he
heilde a trenchant axe and come to the saisne that hadde him
vn-horsed,   <MILESTONE N="93a" UNIT="folio"/>and wende to smyte hym vpon the helme, but whan
Orienx saugh the stroke come he it douted, and couered hym
with his shielde, and Gawein hym smote that the axe bente and
slit the sheilde in two, the stroke was grete, and Orienx spored
his horse forth, the stroke descended vpon the helme and kut the
cercle and a quarter of the helme, and the mayle of the haubreke
be-hynde, and the horse chyne a-sonder, that he blusht  to the
grounde, and Gaheries smote so Solunant thourgh the heed with
an axe that ded he drof to the erthe, and Gaheret smote Vabibre
thourgh the helme that he slit hym to the teth, and Galashin
smote Pinados that the heed fley in to the feilde.</P><P>  Whan the saisnes saugh Orienx lye at the grounde thei hadde
grete drede that he hadde be deed, and shof alle to the
rescewe ther a-boute hym environ, and bar hym oute of the presse
in to the feilde, but he was stonyed of the stroke that he myght
not stonde on his feet ne meve no membre that he hadde, and
ther-to he made so lotly chere and so hidouse semblant, that alle
wende he hadde ben deed, and made a-monge hem grete doell and
wepynge that all the bataile lefte, and the childeren haue
Agravain <CORR SIC="tken">taken</CORR>   vp ther he was fallen and set hym on horse, and the

karll that hadde brought thider Gawein hadde chaunged his forme
to a-nother, and hadde take the semblance of a knyght armed,
and than com to Gawein and to his other bretheren and seide,
"Feire lordes, yef ye do be my counseile, lete vs take the wey
now right towarde Camelot while these saisnes entende to make
this sorowe."  Whan Gawein vndirstode these wordes, he wiste
wele his counseile was wise and with-oute trecherie, and com
a-noon to Seigramore and seide he was right welcome and his
companye, and he a-gein hym salude as deboner and curteys, and
than he seid, "Ha! seigramor, feire frende, it is tyme now that
we go and lede with vs the peple that is vs be lefte, for I-nough
haue we wonne seth that saf and sounde we repeyre."  Than
Seigramor asked what he was that so spake vn-to hym, and he
seide, "My name is Gawein, the nevew of kynge Arthur, and the
sone of kynge loot of Orcanye, and kepe the londes of myn oncle,
I and my bretheren, till he be come from Tamelide, and we be
come hider for not elles but yow for to helpe and to socoure, ffor
in the morowe it was tolde how ye were assailed of the saisnes
right sore."</P><P>  Than com forth the knyght that hadde spoke to Gawein, and
cried, "A! Gawein, feire sir, what a-bide ye that ye come
not forthe youre wey; se not ye that all the worle of peple
cometh vpon vs, wherefore we may not ascape yef ye a-bide?"
Whan Gawein herde hym so haste to garison, he be-heilde and
saugh come so grete plente of saisnes, and so grete foison, that
alle the feilde was couered, and thei were alle armed, and com
rydinge   <MILESTONE N="93b" UNIT="folio"/>fiercely, and made soche noyse and soche murmur, that
a myle of lengthe it myght haue ben herde, and whan that Gawein
saugh the saisnes come in soche maner, he seide to Seigramor,
"Sir, and hit ples yow gowe hens."  And he hym ansuerde and
seide, "With goode will."  And thei than rode forth toward
Camelot clos to-geder and streite, that ye myght haue caste a
glove ouer her hedes covered vndir steill; and the saisnes yet
entended to Orienx makynge grete doell and sorowe, but
withynne a while a-roos the saisne fro disturdison, and saugh hem
a-boute hym made grete sorowe and hevynesse.  Than he asked


<EPB/><PB N="267" ID="pb.267"/>

a newe helme and sheilde and spere, for he was of grete herte and
a goode knyght and hardy as of his age, and he swore yef he
myght with hym that yaf hym that acooley whereof he hadde so
leyen in swowne at erthe, he sholde it hym wele a-quyte, and than
he lepe to horse that was stronge and swyfte rennynge, and rode
that wey as he wende to haue hem founden, but thei were go
thens a myle.  Whan Orienx saugh hem gon in this maner, he
cried his ensigne and seide, "Now after hem," and than he swore
that noon of hem sholde ascape.  Than pressed forth the saisnes
hastely alle that myght, that oon ne a-bode not a-nother, and the
shoute and the noyse a-roos so grete that wonder it was to here,
and the duste and the powder a-roos so thikke that the clier air
was trouble, and thei com drivinge on so faste that thei nyghed
nygh to atteyne the cristin; and than the knyght that hadde yeve
Gawein this counseile saugh hem come so faste, he hasted sore
Gawein and alle the tother for to go faste, and spake vnto hem
that thei rode a gretter paas; but er thei com to the town of
Camelot thei were sore hasted.  But the noble Gawein and
Agravain and Gaheret and Gaheries and Galaishin and Seigramor were
the laste, and sente in theire felowes and her peple, and her
harneys be-fore, as the heirde driveth his bestes to pasture, and
ther while thei suffred the saisnes to breke theire speres, and
whan thei saugh eny of her felowes ouer charged, thei hem
delyuered at her power as thei that were of high prowesse, and
thei dide so well, that ther nas saisne so hardy that durste that
wey go, wher <CORR SIC="as as">as</CORR>   thei were ne of hem a-bide a stroke.  Than com
Orienx with the grete baner, and hadde a grete spere, whereof
the heed is sharp and trenchaunt, and saugh hym that hadde hym
smyte to grounde, and knewe hym full well, and swoor by his

vpon the saisnes that were so cruwell at the entre of the foreste

made to be writen of Blase his maister, so as ye shull heren after;
and whan it was I-wreten he departed from Blaase and com to

thei hym tolde how that the kynge Ydiers hadde don hem grete

horse to Gawein, that wolde haue pursued the saisnes, and he
seide, "Gawein, Gawein, and thou do after my rede returne
agein and bringe with the alle thi felowes in to Arondell, ffor, lo,

couered all his breste and was all white, and a chapelet of coton
vpon his hede, and clothed in a robe of blakke, and for age heilde
hym by the sadill bowe, and loked vpon Gawein and seide,
"Gawein, do as a wise man and leve me well, for alle thi felowes
be not of thi strengthe ne force, and as well owest thow to love

rode towarde Arondell after the kynge Arans, that all the londe

he greved in the ende; so that he be-hoved to bringe his wif to the
Castell of Glocedon for strengthe.  Whan the kynge saugh how
the saisnes wasted his londe and distroied, and hadde slain so
moche of his peple that he myght not but kepe hym in stronge

cursed the hour and the day that he was at werre with kynge
Arthur, "for by hym haue I loste alle my childeren," and on that
other side his Citee was alle wasted, and he ne loked but after
the hour to be take with-ynne, ffor the   <MILESTONE N="104a" UNIT="folio"/>walles were broke down
in many places, and saugh also how the kynge Arans was loged
all a-boute hym, and he hadde no peple in his companye that
myght eny while hym with-stonde yef the kynge Arans wolde

toke counseile what was beste to do, and his counseile
in the ende was this, that at the firste cokke crowinge he sholde

kynge loot sore aflayed, ffor they mette Teucus with thre
thousand saisnes that repaired from Arondell that condited the pray

thei ronne vpon hym with grete hete, and ther a while was
stronge stour and full nobly dide the kynge loot and the vC that
were in his companye; but of well doynge was litill myster, for
soone were thei discounfited and chased oute of the feilde, and

faste as the horse myght hym bere.  But now cesseth a litill of
kynge loot and returne to Gawein.</P><P>  Full gladde and mery were Gawein and his felowes at Arondell

strokes that he hadde receyued of swerdes a-bove and be-nethe,
and his couerynge cote alle to-rente, and his hauberke torn and
broken in many places, and he com be-fore Arondell a grete

he was shamefaste, and seide that though he sholde
dye he wolde holde hym companye, and he be-gan for to go that
full well knewe his corage, and Gawein cleped hym a-gein and
cried, "Sir knyght, lo! me here all redy to go with yow.  But
that ye shull me ensure that for noon euell ye make me it for to

and be-gan to smyle as it were in scorne, and seide as for that
sholde he not lette, but that he wolde make hym the assuraunce,
and Gawein asked his armes and armed hym wightly a-noon, and
he a-boode that gretly hym hasted.  And the felowes of Gawein
com to hym and seide, "Sir, what thinke ye to do?  Ne goth not
with-outen vs, for we wote neuer whether it be for goode or for

with hym yef the knyght wolde assente.  "And we shull hym
aske," seide Galashin.  Than ran Seigramor to the knyght and
asked, "Sir knyght, and it plese yow ther ben somme here-ynne

that ye will hem graunte to holde with yow companye."  And
the knyght hem ansuerde and seide he wolde it well, and well it
hym plesed that alle wente that go wolde, ffor the auenture is
soche that noon shall faile to fynde his auenture that ther

thei were cristin, and seide, "I am with the kynge loot that the

I shall telle the what thow shalt do; thow shalt go reste the

alle the company to-geder; but two hundre squyers thei lefte at
Arondell to kepe the Castell, and ledde with hem the lady and hir
litill sone.  And the foure bretheren swore that neuer sholde the
kynge loot her fader haue a-gein theire moder till that he hadde

"that taught yow where was youre moder, ne knewe ye no

coniured that I shall telle yow   <MILESTONE N="106b" UNIT="folio"/>whi; but be well ware that ye
lete no man knowe of no-thinge that I sey vn-to yow."  And
Gawein seide, "Nay, for hym were lever to haue his tonge

these tidinges hath brought it is Merlin, that is the beste devynour
that is in all the worlde or euer was."  "How sir," quod Gawein,
"speke ye of that Merlin that was so well be-loved of
Vterpendragon, that was be-geten of the devell vpon a woman?"  "Of
that same," seide Doo, "speke I with-oute faile."  "A god
mercy," seide Gawein, "how myght this be or bifalle that I haue
seyn hym in so many maner formes, for I haue seyn hym in thre

hym chaungeth in to as many semblaunces as he will."  Than
Gawein hym blissed for the merveile that he ther-of hadde, and
seide that he wolde with hym be a-queynteth yef it hym plesed,

vnder a mounteyne rounde side be side to the forest of Briok,
that was full delitable and feire, for to hunte at hertes and at
hyndes, and bukke and doo and wilde swyn.  This mayden of
whom I speke was the doughter of a vauasor of right high lynage,
and his name was cleped Dionas, and many tymes diane com to
speke with hym, that was the goddesse, and was with hym many
dayes, for he was hir godsone; and whan she departed she yaf
hym a yefte that plesed hym wele.  "Dionas," quod diane, "I
graunte the, and so doth the god of the see and of the sterres

and whan Dionas was grete he was right a feire knyght and a
goode, of high prowesse of body, and he was moche and longe,
and longe tyme serued a Duke of Burgoyne, that to hym yaf his

all quyte, and that other half was the kynge Ban.  Whan
the Duke hadde maried his nyece he yaf to Dionas his part of
this foreste and londe that he hadde a-boute grete plente, and
whan Dionas wente it for to se it plesed hym wele, and he lete
make a maner to repeire to, that was right feire and riche by the
vyuier, and <CORR SIC="whan it whan it">whan it</CORR>   was made he com thider to be ther for the
deduyt of the wode and the river that was nygh, and ther a-boode
Dionas longe tyme, and repeired ofte to the court of kynge Ban,
hym serued with ix knyghtes, and in his seruise he yede at many
a grete nede a-gein the kynge Claudas, to whom he dide many a
grete damage, till that the kynge Ban and the kynge Boors
 <MILESTONE N="108b" UNIT="folio"/> hadden hym in grete love, ffor thei knewe hym so noble a knyght
and so trewe, and the kynge Ban to hym graunted his parte of
this foreste in heritage to hym and to his heyres, and londe and
rentys grete foyson; and the kynge Boors yaf hym also a town
and men and londe, for the grete trouthe that he saugh in hym,
and he was so graciouse, that alle tho that a-boute hym repeyred
loved hym a-bove all thinge.  Thus dwelled Dionas in that londe
longe tyme, till that he gat vpon his wif a doughter of excellent
bewte, and hir name was cleped Nimiane, and it is a name of
ebrewe, that seith in frensch, ment neu ferai, that is to sey in
english, I shall not lye, and this turned vpon Merlin, as ye shall
here her-after.  This mayden wax till she was xij yere of age
whan Merlin com to speke with leonces of Paerne, and Merlin
spedde hym so that he com to the foreste of Brioke, and than he
toke a semblaunce of a feire yonge squyre, and drowgh hym down
to a welle, where-of the springes were feire and the water clere,
and the grauell so feire that it semed of fyn siluer.  To this
fountayn ofte tyme com nimiane for to disporte, and the same
day that Merlin com thider was she come; and whan Merlin hir
saugh he be-hilde hir moche, and a-vised hir well er he spake
eny worde, and thought that a moche fole were he, yef he slepte
so in his synne to lese his witte and his connynge for to haue the
deduyt of a mayden, and hym-self shamed, and god to lese and

displese.  And whan he hadde longe thought, he hir salued, and
she ansuerde wisely and seide, "That lorde that alle thoughtes
knoweth sende hym soche volunte and soche corage that hym be
to profite, and hym not greve ne noon other, and the same welthe
and the same honour hym sende as he wolde to other."  And
when Merlin herde the maide thus speke, he sett hym down vpon
the brinke of the welle and asked hir what she was; and she
seide she was of this contrey, the daughter of a vauasour, a
grete Gentilman, that was at a manoir ther-ynne, "and what be
ye, feire swete frende?" quod she.  "Dameselle," quod Merlin,
"I am a squyer traueillinge that go for to seche my maister, that
was wonte me for to teche, and moche he is for to preise."  "And
what maister is that?" seide the maiden.  "Certes," quod he,
"he taught me so moche, that I cowde here reyse a Castell, and
I cowde make with-oute peple grete plente that it sholde assaile,
and with-ynne also peple that it sholde defende, and yet I sholde
do mo maistries, ffor I cowde go vpon this water and not wete
my feet, and also I cowde make a river where as neuer hadde
be water."</P><P>  "Certes," seide the maiden, "these be queynte craftes, and
fayn wolde I that I cowde do soche disportes."  "Certes,"
seide the squyer, "yet can I mo delitable pleyes, for to reioise
euery high astate more than these ben, ffor noon can devise
nothinge but that I shall it do, and make it to endure as longe as I
will."  "Certes," seide the maiden, "yef it were to yow no gref,
I wolde se somme pleyes by couenaunt that I sholde euer be youre
love."  "Certes," seide Merlin, "ye seme to me so plesaunt and
deboneir, that for youre love I shall shewe yow a party of my
pleyes, by couenaunt that youre love shall be myn, for other
thinge will I not aske."  And she hym graunted that noon euell
ne thought, and Merlin turned hym a-part and made a cerne with
a yerde in myddell of the   <MILESTONE N="109a" UNIT="folio"/>launde, and than returned to the
maiden, and satte a-gein down by the fountayn, and a-noon the
mayden be-heilde and saugh come oute of the foreste of briogne
ladyes and knyghtes and maydons and squyres, eche holdinge

Iogelours and tymbres and tabours, and com be-fore the cerne that
Merlin hadde made, and whan thei were with-ynne, thei be-gonne
the caroles and the daunces so grete and so merveilouse, that oon
myght not sey the fourthe parte of the ioye that ther was made,
and for that the launde was so grete, Merlin lete rere a vergier,
where-ynne was all maner of fruyt and alle maner of flowres, that
yaf so grete swetnesse of flavour, that merveile it were for to
telle; and the maiden that all this hadde seyn was a-baisshed of
the merveile that she saugh, and was so at ese that sche ne
a-tended to no-thinge but to be-holde and entende what songe thei

comencent amours en ioye, et fynissent en dolours."  In this
maner dured the ioye and feste from mydday to euenesonge, that
oon myght here the noyse from fer, ffor it was right high and
clere, and plesaunt to heren, and it semed to be of moche peple,
and oute of the Castell com Dionas and man and wif grete plente,
and be-heilde and saugh the feire orcharde and the daunces and
the caroles so feire and so grete, that neuer hadde thei seyn soche

thei saugh ther so feire ther noon was be-fore, and on that other
side thei merveiled whens alle these ladyes and the knyghtes
were come so wele a-pareiled of robes and Iuewelles.  And whan
the caroles hadde longe dured, the ladyes and the maydenys satte
down vpon the grene herbes and fressh floures, and the squyres
set vp a quyntayne in myddes of the medowes, and wente to
bourde a partye of the yonge knyghtes, and on that other parte
bourded the yonge squyres with sheldes oon a-gein a-nother that
neuer ne lefte till euesonge tyme.  And than com Merlin to the
mayden and toke hir be the hande and seide, "Damesell, how
seme ye?"  "Ffeire swete frende," seide the mayden, "ye haue
don so moche that I am all yours."  "Damesell," quod he, "now

I shall teche yow so many merveilles that neuer woman cowde
so many."</P><P>  Quod the maiden, "How knowe ye that I am a clerke?"
"Damesell," qoud Merlin, "I knowe it well, ffor my
maister hath me so well taught that I knowe alle thinges that

Merlin helde this Parlement, assembled a-gein the maidenes and
the ladyes, and wente daunsinge <CORR SIC="and and">and</CORR>  bourdinge toward the foreste
fro whens thei were come firste; and whan thei were nygh thei
entred in so sodaynly, that oon ne wiste where thei were be-come;
but the orcharde a-bode   <MILESTONE N="109b" UNIT="folio"/>stille ther longe tyme, ffor the maiden
that swetly ther-of hym praide, and was cleped ther by name the
repeire of ioye and of feeste.  And whan Merlin and the maiden
hadde be longe to-geder, Merlin seyde at the laste, "Ffeire maiden,
I go, for I haue moche to do in other place than here."</P><P>  "How," qoud the maiden, "feire frende, shull ye not teche
me firste some of youre pleyes?"  "Damesell," quod
Merlin, "ne haste yow not sore, ffor ye shull know I-nowe all in

on that other side I haue yet no suerte of youre love."  "Sir,"
qoud she, "what suerte wolde ye aske? devise ye, and I shall it
make."  "I will," quod Merlin, "that ye me ensure that youre love
shall be myn, and ye also for to do my plesier of what I will."  And
the maiden her be-thought a litill, and than she seide, "Sir," quod
she, "with goode will by soche forwarde, that after that ye haue
me taught all the thinges that I shall yow aske, and that I can
hem werke."  And Merlin seide that so it plesed hym
well.  Than he a-sured the maiden to holde couenaunt like as she

hadde devised, and he toke hire surete.  Than he taught hir
ther a pley that she wrought after many tymes, ffor he taught
hir to do come a grete river ouer all ther as her liked, and to
a-bide as longe as she wolde; and of other games I-nowe,
where-of she wrote the wordes in perchemyn soche as he hir
devised, and she it cowde full well bringe it to ende.  And whan
he hadde a-biden ther till euesonge tyme, he comaunded hir to god
and she hym, but er he departed the maiden hym asked whan he
sholde come a-gein; and he seide on seint Iohnes even; and thus
departed that oon fro that other.  And Merlin went to Tamelide,
where the kynges made hym grete ioye whan that thei hym
saugh.  But now a-while we moste cesse here, and speke of the

speketh of Merlyn, that is departed fro Nimiame, from the foreste

yoven to his love, that the same nyght he com to
Toraise in Tamelide, where as the kynges were of hym right
gladde and ioyfull, and sore hem longed hym for to seen, ffor the
kynge leodogan hadde so spedde that his men were come, and
a-bide the hour that the hoste sholde assemble for to go a-reise
the kynge Rion be-fore the Citee of nablaise, where he lay at
sege.  Than the thre kynges toke Merlin in counseile, and seide,
"Merlin, what shall we do, the hoste shall meve hastely?"  "I
shall telle yow," seide Merlin, "what ye shull do.  Go and sey
to the kynge leodogan that he do ordeyne his peple to bataile,
and devise his wardes, and sette yow on wey the morowe after

tidinges of his londe how thei hadde seth don.  And
he tolde hem alle the auuentures that hadde ben in the reme of
logres seth he departed from hym, and how alle the childeren
were assembled; and after he tolde how that the sones of kynge
loot hadde rescowed theire moder from the saisnes, and tolde how
the bretheren hadde seide how the kynge loot theire fader sholde
neuer haue a-gein his wif in companye, ne their frende he shall
not be, till he haue made a-corde with yow.  And the kynge
Arthur was ther-of right gladde, and be-gan to laughe for ioye,
and thanke hym of that seruyse.  Aftre that he turned to the
kynge Ban and towarde the kynge Boors.  "And ye, feire lordes,"


<EPB/><PB N="315" ID="pb.315"/>

quod Merlin, "how shull ye do? ffor ye haue a werke towarde, and
that right grete, where-as ye shall haue grete peyne and traueyle, an
I shall telle yow what."  And that he tolde how Claudas de la desert
hadde wrought, and how ffrolles and Pounces and Antoneyes com
with a grete hoste for to take her londe and it to distroie; "and I
haue seth," quod he, "ben there and spoke with leonce of Paerne,
youre cosin, that sendeth yow gretinge by me, and I haue tolde
hym the ordenaunce of hem that come to distroye the londes.</P><P>  Whan thei herde Merlin thus speke thei were so hevy and
so pensef that thei wiste not what to sey ne do.  Whan
the kynge Arthur saugh hem so enterprised, he be-gan for to wepe
with this yien, and seide to Merlin, "Ha, feire swete frende, haue
pyte of hem and of her londes and sette soche counseile as ye
knowe is myster, ffor I wote wele yef ye hem faile thei haue all
loste; ne I shall neuer than haue ioye in my lif tyme."  "Certes,"
quod Merlin, "thei shull not drede to be distroied while I am in
her companye, and I do yow to wete that to yow and to hem
encreseth moche werke and besynesse euery day, ffor the grete
dragon, as seith the prophesie shall com to chase the lyon crowned
oute of the bloy breteigne, with the helpe that he shall haue of
xxix serpentes that shull be merveillouse grete and stronge, that
shall be so grete and fierce, and moche he shall hym peyne, and a
partie he shall haue of the grete serpentes crowne, to whom alle the
beestes of the bloy bretaigne and of Tamelide shull enclyne a partie
for his fiercenesse and his grete prowesse, but yet is not born the
leopart by whiche the lyon shall be sustened that the grete dragon
shall no power haue hym to enchase from his conuersacion."</P><P>  Whan the thre kynges herde Merlin thus speke, thei were
sore a-baisshed, for neuer herde thei hym so derkely
speke, and asked and enquered of hym what it mente; and he
seide that thei sholde no more wite at that tyme; "but thus
moche I sey to the kynge Arthur, that the grete of this mater
longeth vn-to hym."  And ther-with thei cessed of this matere;
and than the kynge Ban hym   <MILESTONE N="111a" UNIT="folio"/>asked what was his counseile, and
how he sholde his londe socoure.  And Merlin seide that yet
shulde thei wite no worde, "but as soone," quod Merlin, "as ye

haue holpen to chase these sarazins out of this contrey, hit
behoveth vs to move with as moche peple as we may haue in this

Arthurs, and by the Castell of Bredigan, and take the tresour
that is grete in the foreste denoyable, where ther be xij of the
beste swerdes that eny man knoweth in eny londe; and with hem
shall the kynge Arthur dubbe his nevewes, that for hym haue
lefte fader and moder and kyn and frendes, and hem <CORR SIC="we"></CORR>  shall we
lede with vs in to the reame of Benoyk, ffor thei that com
thiderwarde ben grete nombre; and whan the bataile is fynysshed, in
the soiour that we shull make in the londe, shall the gret leopart
be engendred, that shall be so prowde and fierce, by whom the
dragon of the fer oute ylles shall drawe hym a-bakke from the
lyon crowned of the bloy bretaigne, that noon harm he ne shall
hym don, and yet he shall well ther-to haue power, but in the fyn
he shall hym Iustice so that he shall make hym come on his knee
as in maner to crie mercy be-fore the crowned lyon."  "Sir,"
quod the kynge Ban, "as for that we be come hider, knowe ye
of that what shall be-falle?"  "Of that haue ye no doute,"
quod Merlin, "that er we departe all this contrey shall be in the
handes of the kynge Arthur."  "Sir," quod the kynge Ban, "of
these derke wordes that ye haue remembered that we vndirstonde
nought, shull ye ought to vs tellen."  "Nay," quod Merlin,
"but thus moche I sey to the kynge Arthur, that all this shall
falle in his tyme."  With that ther entred in a massager, and
asked where were the sowdiours, and oo hym taught in to a
chamber wher thei were yet in counseile, and he wente thider,
and he was right wise and eloquent, and a moche knyhgt and a
feire, and cosin germain to the kynge leodogan, and his name was
Guyomar, and was of xxv yere of age; and this Guyomar caused
afterwarde the reame of logres to be in grete trouble, by whom
the knyghtes of the rounde table hadde after soche peyne and
labour for the damage that the quene Gonnore hym dide, for the
love of Morgain, the suster of kynge Arthur, that so moche hym

loved that the quene a-reisede so grete blame, as the tale shall
reherse here-after whan the tyme cometh to speke of that matier.</P><P>  Whan Guyomar com in to the chamber the kynges departed
from counseile, and com be-fore theym, and hem salued
from the kynge leodogan, "and sent yow to seyn that ye sholde
come speke with hym;" and thei ansuerde thei wolde with goode
will.  Than thei asked their horse and wente to Court; but
thei were not so sone a-light at the halle, but the kynge leodogan
com hem a-geins, and toke hem be the handes, and ledde hem in
to a chamber for to counseile to-geder.  Than spake the kynge
leodogan as he that was right a wise man and well lerned, and
ther were no moo but the fyve only, and than he seide, "Feire
lordes, I holde yow full noble and worthi men and trewe, and
knoweth it well that I love yow right hertely more than ye wene,
and that I ought of right for to do, for ye haue saued my lif and

that me sore for-thinketh, ffor ther is no-thinge that I wolde so
gladly knowe; but I shall wite whan yow lyketh, for other-wise
I will not of yow desire, and I wolde yow asken what we shull
do, for ye knowe well how that the kynge Rion is entred in to

xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men; and on that other side my peple is here assembled,
but thei ben so fewe that thei may not compare with hem, and
therfore I aske yow counseile how we may beste be gouerned,
ffor I putte me all hooll in youre ordenaunce."</P><P>  Than spake Merlin to the kynge, and seide, "Sir, dismay
yow nothinge, ffor be the feith that I owe vn-to yow er

merveiled what he myght be; and he be-heilde hym
ententely that he loked on noon other, and after that he be-heilde
his felowes, that were stille and koy, that seiden not o worde but
be-heilde hym that spake; and whan he hadden hem be-holden a

thought well in his corage that thei were right high men and

the other kynges, and caught hym in her armes and reised hym
vp and assured hym of all that thei myght; and than they wente
to sitte down alle v to-geder as goode felowes and trewe; and
than be-gan Merlin his reson, and seide to the kynge leodogan,


<EPB/><PB N="319" ID="pb.319"/>

"Sir sire, ye wolde fayn wite what we ben and of what peple
and of what lynage."  And he seide ther was nothinge that he
desired so moche to knowe.  "I shall telle yow," quod Merlin,
"firste for what we be come to seche.  Lo, here a yonge lorde that
is a goode knyght as ye knowe well I-nough, and, wite ye well
in trouthe, what-so-euer he be, he is a man of higher lynage and
of londe and frendes than ye be, and yet ye be a kynge crowned;
and he hath no wif, and therfore we come through londes to seche
auentures till that we may fynde some high prince that his
doughter wolde yeve hym in mariage."  "A lorde mercy!" quod
the kynge leodogan, "what go ye ferther than sechinge?  I haue
a doughter that is holden oon of the feirest of the worlde and
the wiseste and oon of the beste lerned, and for defaute of goode
lynage ne of goode londe ought she not to be refused; and yef it
be youre plesier I yeve hir yow to be youre wif; and I haue no

Merlin ansuerde that he hir not sholde refuse neuer, yef god will;
and thanked him the foure felowes righ hertely."</P><P>  Than the kynge hym-self wente to fecche his doughter, and
made hir to be appareiled in the richest wise, and ledde
hir be the honde in to the chambre where-as the foure ffelowes
dide a-bide, and after hem com grete route of knyghtes, where-of
ther-ynne were grete plente, and ther also were alle the companye
of the rounde table, and the xl that the storye hath rehersed, and
many other of high astate, that were come in to the hoste for to
socoure the kynge leodogan; and whan the kynge and his
doughter entred thourgh the chambre that was feire and grete,
the foure felowes com hem a-geyns; and spake the kynge
leodogan that he myght wele ben herde, and seide, "Gentill sir,
cometh forth, for I can not yet yow namen, and resceive here my
doughter to be youre wif, that is so feire and courteise, and
ther-to right wise, with all the honour that to hir appendeth after
my deth, ffor to a worthier than yow may I not hir yeve, and
that knowe well alle these worthi men here-ynne."  And Arthur
stode forth and seide, "Sir, gramercy."  And the kynge leodogan
delyuered hir to hym by the right honde.  And that oon graunted

<EPB/><PB N="320" ID="pb.320"/>

to that other full debonerly, and the kynge hem blissed with his
right honde, and the bisshop of Toraise was sent fore, and than
was the ioye grete ther-ynne that neuer be-fore was ther seyn
gretter.  And than com Merlin and spake to the kynge, heringe
alle that were ther-ynne, "Sir, ye wolde gladly knowe what we
be   <MILESTONE N="112b" UNIT="folio"/>and to whom ye haue yoven youre doughter."  And the
kynge that it so moche desired, that yet wende it not to haue
knowen, seide, "certeynly that gladly wolde he wite yef it were
hir plesier."  "Now knoweth wele," quod Merlin, "and alle tho
that it will heren, that ye haue yoven youre doughter to Arthur,
the kynge of Bretaigne, the sone of kynge Vterpendragon, and
thei owe hym homage bothe ye and alle the barouns of this

shall we go the gladlyer and the more wightly to turneyen a-gein
these sarazins that this londe do werryen, and wolde take and
distroien, but it shall be other-wise than thei wene; and also I do
yow to vndirstonde that these two noble men ben bretheren and

that this was <CORR SIC="the the">the</CORR>   kynge Arthur, thei weren so gladde
that neuer hadde thei so grete ioye be-forn.  And the two kynges
com first be-fore hym and dide hym homage, and after the kynge
leodogan and alle the other barouns, and thei made the feste of the
mariage so riall that neuer in that londe was seyn soche; but ouer
alle other was the quene Gonnore gladde of hir newe lorde.  And
that nyght Merlin lete hym-self be knowen of the knyghtes of
the rounde table with-oute eny moo.  And whan the kynge
leodogan hym knewe he seide that god in this worlde hadde sente hym
goode eure, that to so noble and worthi man hadde hym yove the

kynge leodogan, and than after thei yede to bedde for to reste;

cok crowynge; and than thei rested all day and on the morn, ffor
on the witsonday the kynge leodogan helde court roiall for love
of the barouns that ther were assembled; and the thre kynges
and Merlin satte to-geder at the hede of the deyse, and be-fore
hem satte the two Gonnores, that were wonder like, saf a litill
that oon was heigher and fressher coloured, and that was Arthurs
wif, and the better tonge she hadde, ffor she was of all the worlde
the feirest speker and the beste, and also she hadde more heer
than the tother Gonnore, but of alle other thinges thei resembled
so like that vn-ethe myght oon knowe that oon from that
other.  And after satte the felowes that Arthur hadde brought with the
knyghtes of the rounde table for chierte and gret love, ffor so
wolde Merlin and Gynebans the clerke.  And whan thei hadde
eten thei wente to bedde, but litill while thei lay, for thei roos at
mydnyght.</P><P>  Whan the armes of kynge Arthur were brought, Gonnore
hym helped for to arme right wele and feire, as she
that right wele cowde her ther-of entermete, and hir-self girde
hym with his swerde; and whan the kynge was all armed saf his
helme she toke the spores and sette hem on bothe knelinge; and
Merlin, that all this be-hilde, be-gan to laughe, and shewde to
the two kynges how Gonnore hir entermeted and peyned hym to
serue; and hir preised moche the twey kynges.  But in the fin
she hadde a riche guerdon whan she loste the kynge hir lorde by
mysauenture and by Bertelanx, the traitour, as the book shall
re-herse here-after; and while Merlin be-heilde the maiden that
serued hir lorde, he lough and seide to the kynge, as he that cowde
all goode and full well cowde Iape in myrthe and game, "Sir sire,
never were ye so verily a newe knyght as ye be now, and ther ne
faileth but o thinge that ye were alle a newe knyght; and well may
ye sey whan ye departe hens that a maiden that is kynges doughter
and quenes hath made yow a newe knyght."  "Sir," seide the
kynge, "sey what thinge that is and my lady shall   <MILESTONE N="113b" UNIT="folio"/>it do, but
yef it be to grete a thinge or that she sholde ther-by haue
shame.'  "Certes, sire," seide the maiden full wisely, as she that full well
lerned, "in nothinge that I do to yow may I haue no shame ne

vilonye, ffor I knowe yow so noble and worthy and also curteyse
that ye wolde me not requere nothinge that to vilonye shulde
turne for the beste castell that ye haue."  "Lady," seide Merlin,
"ye sey wisely; neuer for nothinge that I haue seide shall ye
haue no reprof ne that sholde turne yow to no shame."  "What
is it than?" seide the kynge, "I pray yow telle me."  "Sir,"
seide Merlin, "hit is the baisyers, yef to the lady it
plese."  "Certes," seide the kynge, "and for that shall I not leve to be a
newe made knyght."  "No," quod the maiden, "as for that
shall I yow not lese, but that ye shull be myn and I yowrs; and
why sholde ye ther-of me preyen, for also well it pleseth me as
it doth to yow."  Whan the kynge herde hir thus sey he be-gan to
laugh; than the kynge toke hir in armes, and kissed hir swetly
as yonge peple that full well to-geder loved.  And than were the
horse apareiled and brought forth; and Gonnore yaf hir lorde an
helme of merveillouse bountee, and he sette it on his heed; and
than ech comaunded other to god, and rode forth eche warde
after other, the ganfanouns folden and the speres lowe, and rode
a softe pas as Merlin hym guyded as he that wele knewe alle the
passages; and the x knyghtes that were gon be-fore hadde taken
mo than x pantoneres, that alle weren espies of the kynge Rion,
and bounde hem and sette hem in prison, and kepte so well the
passages that thei herde no tidinges.</P><P>  And so well spedde hym Merlin that the firste warde dide
condite that thei come the wednysday at nyght after the
mydnyght in to the hoste of kynge Rion; and the nyght was
right clere and stille, but the moone shone a litill trouble.  And
thei slepte strongeliche in the hoste ffor the tyme that relented,
ffor on the day was right grete hete in the hoste, and ther-to thei
hadden dronken I-nough.  And Merlin sette in be-twene the
wode and the river, and comaunded that no man presse in to the
hoste till that thei herde an horne blowe; and as the wardes
passeden ouer oon after a-nother, Merlin a-bode hem alle, and
made hem close to-geder; and than wente Merlin to the baner,
and toke an horne and blewe it so lowde that all the foreste and
the river resownnded that a man myght heere the horne well half

a myle.  Than Merlin cried, "Lady seint Marie, praye to oure
lorde god, thi blissed sone, that he now be oure helpe."  "Now
sette on manly," quod he, "gentill knyghtes, ffor now shall it be
sein who is noble and worthi, ffor I do yow to wete that ye
be alle at the deth or at the lif, and noon ne hath no heede
but he hit now deffende."  And whan thei herde the horne
a-noon thei slaked theire reynes and spored theire horse and
smote in to the hoste with grete ravyne; and ther ye sholde
haue sein tentes and pavilouns reverse to the grounde, ffor Merlin
by crafte made soche a trobellion a-rise that ther lefte   <MILESTONE N="114a" UNIT="folio"/>nother
tente ne pavilon stondinge, but fellen vpon theire heedes that lay
with-ynne; and thei smyten in to the hoste on alle parties, and
slowgh and maymed what thei myght a-reche, ffor ther was made
of hem grete slaughter er thei were a-parceyved in the hoste what
peple thei were, till that thei herde the brayes and the dolerouse
cries as thei weren slain and mangeled of hem that of hir deth
hadde no pitee.  Than comaunded the heigh lordes to theire
squyres to make theire horse redy thourgh the hoste, and thei so
dide, and than thei ronne to armes hastely, and peyned hem harde
to be smartly armed and soone; and as soone as thei myght be
armed thei assembled at the tente of kynge Rion, and blowen
hornes and trumpes right harde.  And the cristin hadde so hurled
a-monge hem vp and down that mo than thre thousande thei
hadde so araied that neuer repeired thens, and chase the remenaunt
to kynge Rions tente; ther thei made hir gaderinge, and ther
thei stalled, for thei were moche peple and stronge; and than
armed hem thei that were not armed, and tho apered the feire
day and cleire, and than the wardes drowen vp and appereilled
hem in ordre, and eche gadered his peple a-boute hym, and ther
thei reised theire baners a-lofte that flekered in the wynde, and
the bright soone smote vpon the bright armurs that it glistered so
bright that merveile was to be-holden.</P><P>  Whan the kynge Rion saugh the damage that thei hadde
hym don he was nygh wode for ire, and satte vpon a
grete horse that was wonder stronge and swight, and hadde an ax
hanginge at his sadill be-fore, that was grete and hevy of harde


<EPB/><PB N="325" ID="pb.325"/>

stiell, and rode so vp and down, devisinge who sholde go be-fore
and who sholde go be-hynde; and than he cleped Solynas, a knyght
of grete prowese and right hardy, that was his nevew, and seide,
"Solinas, thow shalt lede the firste bataile with an hundred
thousande men of armes of soche peple as ye will, and thow shalt go
and a-venge my shame and youre harmes."  And he seide he
wolde well so that he wolde deserue of hym no blame.  Than
departed he that was wight and hardy and merveillouse stronge;
and as soone as Merlin saugh hym come he rode hym a-geins with
the dragon, and he hym disfigured in soche manere that no man
saugh who it bar saf the thre kynges.  Whan Merlin saugh that
he com nygh, he seide to the kynge Arthur, "Arthur," quod he,
"now shall it be sene how well ye shull do, and loke that the
kisse that youre love yow yaf be to somme solde so dere that euer
after ther-of be spoken."  And he ansuerde a-gein and seide that
in hym sholde be no feyntise, and no more he ne seide.  And
than approched that oon bataile to that other right nygh, and
than thei leide theire speres in fewtre, and mette to-geder with
trenchaunt heedes vpon the sheldes that ech hurte other and
wounded and bar to the grounde; ther dide the kynge Arthur a
pointe that moche was be-holden.</P><P>  Whan Arthur saugh bothe partyes so nygh approche, he
smote the horse with the spores a-gein Ionap, a grete
Geaunt and merveillous stronge; and he saugh hym so come he
douted   <MILESTONE N="114b" UNIT="folio"/>hym but litill, for he semed a-gein hym but a
chielde.  Thei com faste and rudely, and Arthur was smyte with Ionappes
spere in the shelde so rudely that the shafte passed thourgh his
lifte flanke an arme lengthe; and Arthur smote hym a-gein so
sore that thourgh shelde and sholdre he shof the trenchaunt
spere, but the sarazin was so proude and of so grete strength
that he made no semblaunt of no greuaunce, but hurteled to-geder
so rudely with theire bodyes and with the myght of theire horse
that eche bar other to erthe and the horse vpon theire bodyes, and
ther thei lay a longe while sore astonyed, that the ton cowde telle
no tidinges of the tother.  Than ronne to the rescowse on bothe
two sides; ther was many a grete spere crased and stronge stour of


<EPB/><PB N="326" ID="pb.326"/>

swerdes upon helmes and sheldes.  Ther loste the Geauntes more
than the cristin, but, neuertheles, thei traueyled so on bothe parties
that bothe were thei releved and sette on horse, and than be-gan
the stoure stronge and merveillouse; ther dide the knyghtes of the
rounde table wondres, and the xl felowes, ffor a-gein hem myght
endure noon harneys, ne no kynge, ne warde, ne sheltron, were
it neuer so clos, and drof hem to the standerd, and were so
affraide the meyne of Solinas that thei ne entended but for to
fleen; and the cristin hem enchased and driven in a-monge hem so
harde that alle the renges dide fremysh, and ther be-gan the
chaplee so mortall that neuer was sein more mortalite; grete
prowesse ther dide the knyghtes of the rounde table, but of alle
other ther dide well a yonge knyght, that ought well to be
rehersed in the storye, for he ought not to be for-yeten but to be
remembred what he was and what was his name, ffor he was the
beste that euer was in the tyme of Vterpendragon and in the
tyme of kynge Arthur, as longe as hym liked for to use and to
haunte chiualrie.</P><P>  The storye seith that he was cosin germain vn-to Percevall de
galoys vpon his moder side, of whom this booke shall
speke here-after whan the matier cometh ther-to; and also the
booke seith that this knyght was nygh to Ioseph
Abaramathie, for he was the sone of Enhyngnes, the soster of Ioseph,
that was the wif wedded to Ebron, that hadde xij sones, where-of
the londe of Bretaigne was after enlumyned, and next cosin to
Selydoyne, the sone of Duke Nascien de breting, that the grete
merveile of the graal saugh firste, and also a-pertened to kynge
Pelles of lytenoys and his brethren.  This knyght hadde after
Galaad, the sone of launcelot, many a day in his kepinge, wher-of
the boke shall reherse here-after of alle thinges oon after a-nother
as thei fill day be day.  This knyght of whom I haue so spoken
was cleped Nascien ffor love of the duke Nascien, that was so
noble a knyght, and he was after of so gode lyvinge whan he
hadde lefte chivalrie that he be-com an hermyte; and oure lorde
hym visited and loved so that he was a preste and seide messe,
and was also a mayden and chaste as longe as he leved; and this

same knyght was after ravisshed be the holy goste in to the
thridde heuene, where he saugh a-pertely the fader, sone, and holy
goste.  This knyght hadde after the storie in his kepinge,   <MILESTONE N="115a" UNIT="folio"/>and
wrote with his owne hande by comaundement of the grete
maister; and that he dide write he anexed to the booke that
Blase wrote, the holy hermyte, by the techinge of Merlin.  This
knyght yaf afterwarde, whan he was hermyte, the noble
counseile to kynge Arthur whan he was in pereile to lese his londe, in
the tyme of Galehant, the lorde of the fer oute yles, that werred
vpon Arthur with the power of xxx kynges that he hadde alle
conquered.  But now resteth the tale to speke of thise thinges,
and returneth to telle how thei dide in the bataile.</P><P>  Full grete and harde was the bataile, the thursday after
pentecoste, of the peple of kynge Rion of Denmarke and of
Islonde, a-gein the peple of the reame of Tamelide, and ther the
knyghtes of the rounde table shewde merveilouse prowesse in
armes, but a-boven alle other well dide this Nascien and
Adragayn li bruns: these tweyne dide merveillouse prowesses: these
tweyne brake the sheltrouns with strokes of swerdes, and with
hem also the kynge Arthur.  These thre hilde companye to-geder
that thei haue loste all theire felowes, and what wey that euer
thei yede euer hem gyded the baner of the dragon, and sore
peyned alle the tother felowes for to folowe the baner, but the
sarazins were so many and so thikke that thei myght hem not
persh ne breke, but nede moste thei ruse, and leve place wheder
thei wolde or noon; and these thre be lefte a-monge hem that
sore laboured er thei myght come to the standerd where the baner
waved of the kynge Rion in the wynde that was grete and born
vp with iiij Olyfauntes; and on that other side the kynge Ban
and the kynge Boors saugh how thei haue loste the kynge Arthur,
and that the Geauntes have hym for-closed, thei lete renne theire
horse and lefte theire felowes, and gerden in to the presse, with
swerdes drawen, and slowen and casten down all that thei myght
atteigne, ne neuer cessed hem to percen and thriste thourgh till
thei com to Merlin, that hilde the baner be-fore the kynge
Arthur.  And whan the v felowes weren to-geder and hir banerer that hem


<EPB/><PB N="328" ID="pb.328"/>

gided, than be-gan the medle so cruwell, that oon for that other,
that merveile it was to be-holde.  Than fill it that the kynge
Rion com that wey, his ax in his honde, and he was the moste
man and the grettest of corsure of the worlde, and happed that
he mette firste in his wey the kynge Boors, that chased the kynge
Saron with swerde drawen, that a merveillous stroke he hadde
hym yoven with a spere thurgh the shelde, that ner he hadde
hym felled to grounde, but as he kepte hym by the arson of his
sadell, and with-oute faile hadde not the spere broken he hadde
falle to grounde; and as soone as the spere was spente the kynge
Boors redressed hym in his sadell and ficched hym so in his
steropes so harde that the Iren bente, and he hilde his swerde
naked, and clipte his shelde to his breste, and ran to the Geaunte,
and whan the Geaunte saugh hym come he fledde, for he durste
hym not a-bide; and the kynge Boors hym pursude that loth was
hym to leve, and of that dide he grete folye, ffor he hadde paste
his felowes the space of a bowe draught, and thei ne myght not
hym ouer-take; and than happed hym mette the   <MILESTONE N="115b" UNIT="folio"/>kynge Rion,
that com ridinge wonder faste, with all the force of xvij kynges
crowned, and alle were thei hardy knyghtes and sure in armes,
and the kynge Rion rode be-fore the caste of a ston, and helde in
his hande a grete malle of brasse, and he was grete and stronge,
and sat vpon a stronge horse and a grete, and mette the kynge
Boors, that chased the kynge Saron, and hilde hym so straite
that he smote hym vpon the helme that he made hym stoupe on
the arson of the sadell, and as he sholde haue recouerd a-nother
stroke to smyte of the hede, the horse that he satte on caught the
bridell with the teth, and bar hym ferther than he wolde, the kynge,
that smote with so grete myght, <CORR SIC=" ">myght</CORR> not with-drawe his
stroke, but hitte ther as he wolde not haue smyten, ffor he smote
of the horse hede of the kynge Saron faste by the eeres, that
bothe the horse and the hover fill to the erthe, and than Boors
rode ouer hym, and fayn wolde haue light yef he hadde
leyser.  But the kynge Rion that com fer be-fore cried, and seide, "Sir
knyght, so fer haste thow gon that late it is to repente, for he is
longinge to me, and ther-fore I com hym for to chalenge, and


<EPB/><PB N="329" ID="pb.329"/>

thow shalt wite yef be-twene hym and me were eny love."  Than
he spored his horse harde that the blode sterte oute on bothe two
sides, and he ran so swyfte that the felde that was full of smale
caliouns that the fire sparkeled thikke, and the kynge Boors
behilde and saugh come the grete Geaunte so nygh that he myght
not glenche a-side on no parte, and saugh come so grete foyson of
peple after hym that all the felde was couered, and saugh well
yef he a-bode he were in grete a-uenture of deth, and than he
seide a-gein, "A mercy lorde god, for yef I go thus shall I neuer
haue honour, ffor euer it shall be to me reprof and holde
cowardise, and yet hadde I leuer to dye with worship than lyve with
shame; now god do with me his plesier," quod he, "for I will
a-bide."  Than he made vpon hym the signe of the very crosse,
and hilde his swerde in his honde that was of grete bounte, and
bode hym that com prikinge thourgh the playn.  Whan the kynge
Rion com to the kynge Boors he threw down his launce, and yaf
hym soche a stroke with the brasen betell so vn-mesurable, that
ner he hadde hym encombred, but he kepte the stroke vpon his
shelde, and Rion smote so rudely that it fill in peces, and Boors
enterpassaunt hit hym on the helme with his swerde so fiercely
that he bente on his horse croupe.  Whan the sarazin saugh that
he hadde of hym failed, he returned a-gein with his betill of
brasse, and the kynge Boors that saugh come so grete foison of
peple and the kynge Rion that hilde hym so shorte, he thought
it foly to a-bide lenger.  Than he priked bakke in to the presse,
and saugh how the kynge Aroans helde hervy the rivell by the
nasell of the helme vpon fote, and hadde hym so beten, he and
his men, that the blode ran oute of mouthe and nose, and thei
hadde his hede smeten of ne hadde be Adragain li bruns, that full
sore hym deffended a-gein mo than an hundred, but in short tyme
he moste haue be   <MILESTONE N="116a" UNIT="folio"/>slayn, whereof hadde be grete damage, ne
hadde be the kynge Boors, that com and saugh hervy at that
myschef, and was ther-fore full sory; and than he priked his horse
toward Aroans and smote hym vpon the helme that he fill flatte
to grounde all a-stonyed.  And whan hervy saugh hym so
delyuered, he hente the horse and lepte vp lightly, and ran in to


<EPB/><PB N="330" ID="pb.330"/>

the presse that dide sore encrese and enforse, ffor all the x wardes
of the kynge leodogan were flusshed to the standerd that the
kynge Rion dide condite, that hadde chaced the kynge Boors till
he com in to the bataile ther he hadde felled the kynge Aroant,
and as soone as he hym saugh he ran vpon hym with his betill in
his honde and wende to smyte hym vpon the helme, and whan he
saugh the stroke come and that he hade no shelde, he spored
forth his horse, and Ryon smote so rudely that the stroke fill
betwene the horse croupe and the sadell that brake the horse chyne,
and bar bothe to the erthe, that oon vpon that other bothe vpon an
hepe.  Than the kynge boors lepte on foote, for he was a knyght
hardy and sure, and the presse was so thikke a-boute hym, that
vn-ethe myght he hym turne, ffor so grete plente of peple sued
the kynge Rion, that no man myght hem nombre, that smote
vpon hem so sore that the cristin rused more than a bowe
shote.  Ther was Boors full sore greved, for the kynge Rion peyned hym
sore to smyte of his hede; and whan hervy de rivell saugh the
goode man at so grete myschef, for he hadde sein hym thries
vpon his knees fallen and a-rise vpon his palmes, he rode that
wey hym for to socoure, and caught a grete stronge spere oute of
a sarazins handes, and smote the kynge Rion thourgh the shelde
and hauberke and the lifte sholdre, but it perced not the
flessh.  Ne for no stroke that he yaf the kynge not meved more ne lesse,
but lifte vp the betill where-with he hadde many a cristin slain,
and wende smyte hervy vpon the helme, but he hym covered with
his shelde, and the stroke com so harde that a quarter fill to the erthe,
and whan he wolde it recover as he that was of right grete forse,
and hervy was full of grete vigour, and hilde his swerde drawen,
and wende to smyte hym vpon the helme, and the kynge caste
his shelde ther a-geins, and hervy hym smote so sore that he slitte
it to the bokle, and the kynge lefte vp agein the betill and wolde
haue smyte hym vpon the helme, and hervy plukked his reyne
a-bakke, for sore he douted the stroke of the grete Geaunte, and
he failed of hym, and smote the horse be the paytrell and braste
the nekke a-sonder, that to grounde fill the horse and his maister,
and whan Adragain saugh his felow fallen, it was no nede to aske

<EPB/><PB N="331" ID="pb.331"/>

yef he were dolent.  Than he drough that wey with his swerde
in his fiste, and smote so the kynge Rion, that he made hym
bende on his horse nekke, and but as he enbrased his horse nekke
he hadde fallen to the erthe all vp-right, and yef Adragain hadde
I-hadde leyser, taken hadde be the vengeaunce with-oute more
taryinge.  Whan the sarazins and the Geauntes saugh the   <MILESTONE N="116b" UNIT="folio"/>kynge
Rion in soche pereill, thei were right wrorth.  Ther was a proude
kynge that was cosin to the kynge Rion, that hight Solinas, that
heilde a spere with an heede of steill: whan he saugh the kynge
Rion so euell I-ledde, it a-noyed hym sore, and than he spored his
stede and smot Adragayn so rudely be-twene the two sholderes
that he bar hym to the erthe vp-right, but a-noon he lept on
foote.  And when the thre knyghtes saugh hem-self so at myschef,
thei drough hem to-geder and foughten so harde that noon to
profer hys honde hem to take; and thei launched at hem dartes
and gauellokes, and hurt and wounded hem in many places, but
thei were of so high herte that nought thei sette of all that was
ther don, but slough and caste down all that thei myght
atteyne.  But the kynge Rion hem kepe so short that taken hadde thei ben,
but as Nascien com with a shorte spere in his honde all blody.</P><P>  Whan Nascien saugh the kynge Boors at soche myssese, and
his two felowes that he so loved, and saugh the kynge
Rion that sore hym peyned hem to damage, he smote his horse
with spores so harde that wey that down goth all that he mette
in hys comynge with the breste of his horse, and braundisshed
his gleyve, and smote the kynge Rion so harde at discouert vpon
the lifte side that he bar hym to the erthe so a-stonyed that he
wiste not whether it were day of nyght; and Nascien passed ouer
his body on horse-bak tweys or thryse, and than his men ronne

and half a palme be-twene his browes, and was grete and lene
and full of veynes and of senewes, and was also so grym a figure
that he was dredefull for to be-holde.</P><P>  Whan Arthur saugh the Geaunte lifte vp his malle he douted
the stroke, and ran to hym so rudely with the body of
his horse that he bar to the erthe bothe Rion and his horse; but
soone was he vpon his foote, but first was Arthur garnysshed of
his armes er the Geaunt were reised, for Arthur was also fallen to

Arthur was wight and lifly, and yet hadde he not but xx yere of

grete and hevy by the thirde part more than he; and as soone as
thei were vp, thei ronne ther to-geder, and Arthur griped
Calibourne, his goode swerde that he pulde oute of the ston,
wher-with that day he hadde yove many a stroke; and as soone as he

bronde of fire, and couered hym with his shelde, and raught a

whan he saugh the stroke comynge he caste the shelde ther a-gein,
for sore he dredde the stroke of the swerde that he saugh so
bright shynynge, ffor he knewe it was of right grete bounte; and
the kynge Arthur smote so in the malle that he helde be-fore hym
in bothe hondes that he kutte the helue a-sonder faste by the

rudely smyten, and discended vpon the corner of his shelde, that
he slitte it to the bokill, and with the plukkynge of his swerde
a-gein to hym he made the kynge Rion for to stomble, that was
sory for his brasen malle that he hadde so loste, and than he leide
honde to his swerde, that was oon of the beste of the worlde, ffor,
as the booke seith, it was som tyme Hercules that ledde Iason

and the booke seith that Vlcan I-forged that swerde in the tyme
of Adrastus, the kynge of Greece, that many a day hadde in his

of Calcedoyne, that day that he dide the message to Ethiocles
for Polemyte, and in his comynge homwarde with the same
swerde he slowgh fifty at an hill, and after wente this swerde fro

drough this swerde that was of so grete bountee, and as
soone as it was oute of the skawberke it caste so grete claretee
that it semed a flame of fire; and the name of this swerde was
Marmyadoise.  And whan Arthur saugh the swerde that so flambed
he preised it moche in his herte, and drough hym a litill vp hit
to be-holde, and coueyted it right sore, and thought that in goode
houre were he born that it myght conquere.  And whan the
kynge Rion saugh hym stonde so stille, he with-stode and hym
a-resoned, as ye shull here.  "Sir knyght," qoud he, "I wote
neuer what thow art, but thow haste do grete hardynesse that
me durste sue or chace a-lone with-oute companye, and for the
prowesse that I se in the I shall do the grete curtesie that I dide
neuer to no man: yeve me that swerde and thyn armes, and telle
me thy name, and after thow shalt go quyte, ffor I haue grete
pite fer to sle the for that thow semest so yonge."  Whan Arthur
vndirstode the wordes of the kynge Rion he hadde ther-of grete
dispite, and ansuerde hym felly, "How wenest to take me so
lightly, that I sholde yelde me recreaunt for that thow art so
grete and so stronge.  But ley down that swerde and tho armes,
and putte the in my mercy, to do with the my plesier outerly, for
I the assure but the deth."  At these wordes lowgh the Geaunte,
and turned the heede in trauerse, and asked hym what he was,
and what was his name, and coniured hym by his creaunce to

sey the trouthe.  And Arthur seide he wolde telle hym by
couenaunt that he wolde telle hym what he were, and he hym
graunted.  "Now knowe thow well," qoud he, "that my name is
Arthur, of Bretaigne, the sone of Vterpendragan, that am come
to chalenge this reame that is myn all quyte, ffor the kynge
leodogan hath yove me hys doughter to my wif, and me haue
don homage alle the high barouns of this reame, and also he

I haue tolde the the trouthe of myn."  Quod the Geaunte,
"Seist thou trouthe that thow art Arthur, the sone of
Vterpendragon, that slough Aungis be-fore the roche of saisnes."  "Of
the same speke I with-oute faile," qoud Arthur.  "I haue made
couenaunt," quod the Geaunte, "that I shall telle the myn

herde Arthur thus speke, he was so wroth that nygh he yede oute
of his witte, and griped his shelde and com with his swerde in
his honde and lifte it high to smyte Arthur on the helme, but he
caste the shelde ther a-gein and lepte a-side in the felde, and he
smote so harde that a quarter fill to the erthe, and Arthur stepped
forth and yaf hym soche a stroke by the lifte yie and made hym

and saugh the blode raile down by the lifte iye, he was nygh wode

sore a-dredde, for he knewe tho that ther com, ffor he wiste
well thei were noble and hardy, and yef he lenger ther a-bide he
knewe well that dye he moste.  Than he com to his horse and
lept vp lightly, and in the lepinge vp Arthur hym smote so harde
that he kutte a-wey a quarter of his helme that the mailes of the
hauberke a-pered all white, and a-stoned hym sore that he bowed
on his horse nekke, and yef he myght haue recovered a-nother
stroke he hadde fallen of his horse to the erthe; but the horse
was of grete force and a-ferde of the stroke, and turned to flight
with the kynge down the roche.</P><P>  Than Arthur lept vpon his horse delyuerly and priked after
all that he myght, and than the kynge Rion loked bakke
and saugh Arthur that dide hym enchace sore that wolde not

kynges, that the thre knyghtes so chaced, com so faste fleynge that
thei ouer-toke the kynge Arthur that kepte the Geaunte so shorte,
that he hadde caste his shelde to cover his hede, for soore he
dredde the goode swerde of Arthur; and while Arthur entended

  <MILESTONE N="121a" UNIT="folio"/>to the Geaunte, Kehenyns hym a-scride, and seide, "Turne the,
in euell tyme haste thow hym pursued, for I will hym
chalenge.  In sory tyme haste thow lefte thy felowes."  Whan Arthur herde
hym so lowde hym a-scrye, he returned with his swerde in his
honde, and ther while the kynge Rion fledde in to the
foreste.  And Arthur com to kehenyns, and he agein hym that nothinge
hym ne douted, and smote to-geder with swerdes full harde vpon
helmes.  And kehenyns smote Arthur vpon the helme that he
made hym stoupe vpon his horse nekke, and Arthur smote so hym
agein, that of his helme he kutte a quarter, the stroke was grete,
and descended be-twene the shelde and the shuldre and kutte of
his lifte arme with all the shelde; and Kehenyns ran vpon hym
to enbrace hym in the tother arme, for he was of grete
strengthe.  Whan Arthur saugh hym come he smote hym with his swerde
be-twene the honde and the elbowe, that the honde fill of with
the swerde; and whan he saugh hym-self so maymed, he cried
and brayed as a bole, and the horse hym bar what wey he
wolde.  And whan the tother v saugh that kehenyns was so araide, hem
for-thought it sore, and ronne vpon Arthur, and he hym couered
with his shelde, as he that daigned not hem for to fle.  And thei
smote at hym vp and down, where thei wende hym moste a-peire,
and thei to-hewe his shelde in many places, but thei hurte of
hym no flessh.  And he smote so ffernycans, that he slitte hym
to the teth, and than he smote to heroars vpon the shelde that
he fill to grounde; and than com the thre knyghtes, Nascien, and
Adrageins, and hervy; and than the thre kynges turned to flight
after the steppes of the horse of kynge Rion where as thei hadde
seyn hym go, and these after that so wolde hem leven.  But now
speke we of the kynge Ban that chaced the kynges.</P><P>  So longe enchaced the kynge Ban after the thre kynges that

stifly, for ther thei ouertoke x of her felowes, that ronne vpon
the kynge Ban as soone as thei hym saugh, and he smote so the
firste that he mette, that he clefte the heede in two peces, and than
he smote a-nother that the shulder disseuered from the body, and
than thridde that the heede fill in to the felde, and thei hym

smyten vpon the helme and the shelde, but thei touched of hym
no flesshe, ffor the hauberke was of grete strenghthe, and as thei
thus foughten com Pignoras, and Sonygrex, and Gaisdon, and
magoras, that the kynge Boors hadde enchaced full harde, and
hem kepte so straite, that thei hadde no leyser hem to returne;
and so haue thei fledde till thei fill vpon hem that the kynge
Ban delyuered grete bataile; and than thei turned the heedes of
theire horse towarde hym that hem pursuwed, and he smote
a-monge hem with so grete force that he bar down Pignoras,
bothe hym and his horse, on oon hepe; and than he smote to
Sinagrex so harde that he clefe hym to the brayn, and he fill

faught   <MILESTONE N="121b" UNIT="folio"/>a-gein x knyghtes, and he spored his horse so sore that
he bar a Sarazin to grounde hym and his horse, and than he
smote a-nother with his swerde that he fill deed, and the thre
kynges that he hadde chaced ronne vpon hym, and smote hym
vpon the helme be-hynde, that he stouped on his horse nekke,
but to arise was it no tyme, but he turned his horse hede a-gein
hem, with his swerde in his hande, and ther be-gan the two
bretheren a sore medle and crewell a-gein the xiij that hem
assailleden, but more thei hem damaged than thei dide hem;
but longe hadde thei not ben ther, whan the kynge Rion com
thider with the swerde drawen, sore hurte and euell affraide, and sore
bledynge of two woundes, that oon on the heede and that other on
the lifte side in the flanke, and whan he saugh the bataile of xiij
knyghtes a-gein tweyne, he dressed hym that wey with his swerde,
for fayn wolde he a-venge his anoye, and he smote at hem so
fiercely, that he made hem remeve the place fro ther thei stoden,
and by his comynge was the kynge Boors born to grounde, and his
horse vpon his body; and than he lifte vp his swerde for to smyte
the kynge Ban vpon the helme, but he couered hym with his
shelde and smote the horse with the spores to eschewe the stroke,
and he slytte the shelde as fer as the he raught, and the kynge Ban
sente hym a stroke with corsheuse, his good swerde, and he caste
his shelde ther a-geins, and the kynge Ban clefte it thourgh-oute,
and the gige also, wherby it henge by his nekke, and it fill in two

Sarazins saugh the kynge Boors fallen, thei ronne vpon hym, and
yaf hym grete strokes at the erthe, and hurte hym in dyuerse
places; and the horse, that was myghty and stronge, lay vpon
his lifte thigh, and hilde hym so straite to the erthe, that a-rise
myght he not; and whan the kynge Ban saugh his brother in
soche pereile, he praide god hym to saue fro mysauenture, for of
hym hadde he grete drede.  Than he spored his horse that wey
and smote the kynge Magoras, so that the heede fill to grounde,
and after he smote a-nother so felly, that the chyne yede a-sonder,
and than he a-bode vpon his brother that moche hym peyned to
arise.  And as thei thus foughten Com fleynge maltaillyet, and
balfinne, and the kynge Mahidrap full faste, ffor ther com thre
knyghtes that hem chaced with grete spede, wher-of that on was
the kynge Arthur, and that other Nascien, and Adragayns li
bruns, the brother of Madagot, the goode knyght of the blake yle
tournoye, that Gawein, the nevew of kynge Arthur, after toke at
Estremors, whan that he kepte in prison his cosin Galashin, that
day that he wolde hym haue hanged vpon the walles of the
town, in despite of kynge Arthur, be-fore his owne iyen, ffor that
he hadde sege be-fore town that he wolde haue take be strength,
and for that the kynge hadde slain oon of his nevewes at a
poynt, that hadde be by-fore the town, as this boke shall tell yow
more clerly here-after, whan the mater cometh ther-to.  The
fourthe felowe that com   <MILESTONE N="122a" UNIT="folio"/>after with these thre knyghtes was
hervy de rivell, the banerer of the rounde table, and as soone as
these thre com ther as the kynge Rion faught hym-self, x a-gein a
sooll knyght, thei dressed hem to the presse and greved hem all

pulled as he that was of grete strengthe, that he a-roos with grete
peyne, and saugh his brother in grete toyle that vigerousely hym
diffended, and than he smote maltailliet that he disseuered the
shulder from the side and he fill deed to the erthe, and he hente
the horse that was of grete bounte and lept in to the sadill, and
a-noon rode in to the presse, and smote so sore the kynge Rion
vpon the helme, that he slitte it in two partes, and he hym

paide a-gein so grete a stroke that his shelde clef a-sonder,
and ther be-gan a medle be-twene hem two full fell and crewell;
and the tother foure that were come to socour the kynge Ban
smote on hem so rudely that ech bar oon deed to the erthe all
blody.  Ther was slayin mahidrap, and balfinnes, and Gloriex,
and mandones, where-fore the kynge Rion was full wroth, for thei
were his nygh kyn.  And whan kynge Rion saugh this
myschaunce turne vpon hym so grete, he was so wroth that nygh he
was oute of his witte, and he helde his swerde naked and ran
vpon Arthur and wende to smythe hym on the heede, but he
glenched a-side, for sore he dredde the stroke of the Geaunte, and
he smote so harde in the shelde that he slitte it in to the myddell,
and whan that he wende to pulle a-gein his swerde the kynge
Arthur smote hym on the arme that sore he hym hurte, and he
lefte the swerde stykinge in the shelde, that sore felt hym hurte,
and was wode for wrath, and Arthur caste down the shelde with
the swerde, for it dide hym but gref.  And when the Geaunte
saugh that he hadde so loste his swerde he was full of grete
sorowe, and ran vpon Arthur with his horse and caught hym by
the shuldres, and wolde haue hym born with force, and so he
sholde haue don yef he hadde leiser, for he was of grete strengthe.</P><P>  Whan Arthur felte the Geaunte that so hym helde he caste
the swerde to the erthe, for he was ferde leste he sholde
haue taken it from hym by force, and than clippid his horse in
bothe his armes a-boute the nekke; and the Geaunte pulled and
drough, but he myght hym not a-race from the sadell.  And the
kynge Ban be-helde and saugh the strife be-twene the Geaunte
and Arthur, and a-noon spored his horse that wey, for he hadde
of hym grete drede; and the Geaunte saugh hym come, he lefte
Arthur, for sore he douted the kynge Ban, and ran vpon hym
with his handes that were grete and square; and the kynge Ban
hym smote with corsheuse, his goode swerde, that he rente his
hauberke be-twene his sholderes and wounde hym right depe;
and whan the kynge Rion felt hym so sore wounded, and saugh
his felowes ly at erthe deed bledynge, he hadde grete drede,   <MILESTONE N="122b" UNIT="folio"/>ffor
he hadde nothinge hym to diffende, and turned the horse, that

was of grete bounte, and wente fleynge as faste as he myght
renne.  And thei lete hym passe, for it was nyght; and he wente
so wroth that for litill he hadde gon oute of witte; and he cursed
his feith and his creaunce, and seide he wolde neuer cesse in all
his age till that he were a-venged, and as soone as he com in to his
contre he wolde sende for his grete hoste so that no londe sholde
a-gein hym endure till he hadde confounded all Bretaigne and all
the peple ther-ynne, and take the kynge Arthur and his helpers,
and do hem be flayn all quyk.  Thus wente kynge Rion, makynge
grete sorowe and weymentacion in to his contrey.</P><P>  Whan the kynge Ban socoured the kynge Arthur from the
kynge Rion, that so wolde a-born hym a-wey, he com
to Arthur and asked hym yef he hadde eny harme.  And he
seide, "Nay."  Than seide Ban, "Where is youre
swerde?"  And Arthur seide it was at erthe, "ffor I caste it down as soone as
the shrewe com rennynge on me to gripe me in his armes; and I
haue wonne the richest iewell, and that I love more than the
richest Citee that I haue."  "What thinge is that?" seide the
kynge Ban.  "That shall ye se a-noon," quod Arthur.  Than he
sette foot to grounde, and yede firste to Calibourne and putte it
in the skaberke whan he hadde dried it clene, and than com to
his shelde, where-ynne stake the swerde of kynge Rion, and he
drough it oute and toke the shelde, and com to his horse and
lepte vp, and than shewde the swerde to the kynge Ban, and it
shone so bright that Arthur hadde ther-of grete ioye, and preide
god sende hym som a-uenture ther he myght it assay and prove
yef it were so grete of bounte as it hadde bewtee.  And thei
were ner the Citee than thei wende, but er thei com ther hem
fill soche a-uenture that ther was noon so wight ne hardy but he
hadde I-nough to done.  But now resteth a litell of hem, and
speke of the kynge leodogan.</P><P>  Whan the kynge leodogan saugh that the Geauntes were so
discounfited, he chaced hem full vigerously till it was
derke nyght; and he and his men slough many.  Than fill it
that the kynge leodogan and Cleodalis his stiwarde departed from
theire peple, for the foreste was derke, that no man that thei

men saugh it was so derke nyght they be-gonne to returne; but
the knyghtes of the rounde table wolde not returne, ne the
felowes of kynge Arthur, but chace the Geauntes full harde, and
many of hem thei slowen; and the storye seith that the kynge
leodogan and Cleodalis chaced so faste Ydras and Atalas
lamnachour and Caulus and Dorilas, these were fer from her peple in the
forest; and whan thei hadde longe fledde, thei ouer-toke xij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> of
her companye at were sory and wroth for theire losse and damage,
and whan these foure saugh the socour, thei cried, "Now at hem,"
and whan these be-helden and saugh thei were but tweyne that
chaced foure kynges,   <MILESTONE N="123a" UNIT="folio"/>thei ronne vpon hem full fiercely, and thei
drough hem to two okes that were grete and full of leves, and
ther-to thei sette here bakkes.  Ther was the kynge leodogan at
erthe and hys horse slayn vndir hym; and whan Cleodalis saugh
hym on foote he alight and sette the kinge on his horse, and bad
hym gon hys wey and he wolde a-bide ther.  And whan the kynge
saugh the trouthe of his stiwarde, he be-gan to sighen full sore
vndir his helme and repente in his herte of that he hadde hym sore
forfeted, and thought in his herte that this bounte wolde he hym
quyte yef he scape a-lyve, and alwey thei hem deffenden a-gein
her enmyes that hem assailed full harde, but the Oke hem socoured
sore that was at theire bakke.  But a-while resteth of hem and
speketh of Guyomar and Synados, that were cosins germain, that
wele hadde don all the day in bataile.</P><P>  This Guyomar and Synados pursude so the sarazins thourgh
the foreste, that thei loste alle her peple, that thei cowde
of hem neyther here ne seen, and hadden so chaced xij Geauntes
full harde, and the xij hadde longe fledde, till thei mette   . of
theire felowes that wente sore affraide, and these ne wiste of hem
nothinge till thei were euen fallen vpon hem, and than these com
so sharply that ech of hem bar oon to grounde; and whan the
sarazins saugh thei were but tweyne, thei drough theire swerdes
and assailed hem right harde.  And thei hem diffended full
vigerously, ffor thei were full noble knyghtes and hardy; and a-noon
ther com to hem a-nother knyght, that was cleped ydiers, and


<EPB/><PB N="349" ID="pb.349"/>

whan he was come he knewe hem a-noon and helped hem
vigerously.  But of hem also resteth a-while the tale, and telleth of
the auenture that fill to Antor, that hadde norisshed Arthur, and
to kay the stiwarde, and Gifflet, and lucas the botiller, and to
marengis, and Gorgain his felowe, and to Blecys the blake, that
was in theire companye, and to Blioberis, and Galescowde, and to
lait hardy, and Colegreuaunt, and kehedin le bel: these xij
chaced faste the sarazins, and many thei slough, thourgh the
foreste.</P><P>  So longe chaced these xij thourgh the foreste, that was derke
for shadowe of the bowes, and also of the nyght, that
sodeynly thei fill vpon the kynge Ali patin, that hadde CC sarazins
in his companye wele horsed, that were full angry for the damage
of the kynge Rion, and for that thei wiste not where thei were
be-come; and whan these xij hadde hem so sodeynly ouertaken,
thei rode in a-monge hem fercely, and thei returned and be-gonne
a bataile right stronge, ffor these xij were full worthi knyghtes
and noble.  Ther was stronge fight and harde, that dured till
mydnyght was paste er thei departed, and on that other side the
knyghtes of the rounde table were departed in thre partees: in
that oon part were xij, in a-nother xx, and in that other
xxv; and with the kynge Arthur were thre, that ledde hym
towarde Toraise, in talmelide, and alle the tother weren  <MILESTONE N="123b" UNIT="folio"/>returned
whan thei hadde hem a-while conveyed.  And whan thei come
be-fore the Citee of Danablise, and eueriche ne fonde not his
companye, thei trowed that thei were alle deed; and whan the
two kynges were not founden, the kynge Arthur ne the kynge
leodogan, thei made grete sorowe, and wende thei hadde ben alle
deed; but yet thei a-boode to heere som tidinges, and logged
hem in the medowes, and wolde not entre in to the town, but
wacched till it was day.  Here leveth now of hem and speketh
of Merlin.</P><P>  Now, whan the Geauntes and the sarazins fledde oute of the
feilde discounfited and the chace was be-gonne, the booke
seith that Merlin sewed a companye that were well x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, till thei
fill in to a launde that was depe in the foreste.  This companye


<EPB/><PB N="350" ID="pb.350"/>

ledde the kynge Galad, that was lorde of the londe cleped
Pastures, and as soone as thei were entred in to this launde, Merlin
caste an enchauntement, that he made seme ther com rennynge
so grete a water in her wey be-fore hem, that was so depe and
brode and ther-to blakke, that com down fro the sides of the
mounteynes so rudely, that ther was noon so hardy but he ther-of
hadde drede; and whan thei wolde haue turned a-gein, thei saugh
a-rise soche a storme and a wynde so grete, that thei wiste not
whiche wey to turne, and a-boode stille all nyght in this maner
wise, that thei wente nother bakke ne forewarde; and why Merlin
made this enchauntement hit is right and reson that the trouthe
be declared whi was the cause.</P><P>  This was the trouthe, that in the marche of Tamelide and of
Bredigan west-warde towarde the londe of the kynge Rion
was a reame full riche, that the kynge Amant helde in his
baile.  In this reame werred the kynge Vterpendragon in his lif-tyme
longe, ffor that the kynge Amaunt wolde not be-come his liege
man, and his londe was so stronge that litill he hym douted; but
Vterpendragon greved hym sore with his werre, and conquered
vpon hym a Castell that was stronge and riche, and was clepede
Carroie.  This Castell hadde in fee v<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> knyghtes, that eche yere
thre monethes oughten ther to warde, whiche seison of the yere
that the lorde wolde hem somowne, and the lordship lasted xx
myle on euery side.  This Castell yaf Vterpendragon to the kynge
Boors of Gannes in his lyve to hym and to his heires all the lordship,
and as soone as the kynge Bohors hadde it in his baille, he yaf it
to Guynebant, his brother, that was a goode clerke and a wise,
and at armes wight and hardy yef nede were, and therfore was
the kynge Amaunt angry; and whan he herde that the kynge
Rion was entred in to the londe of kynge leodogan, and on that
other side in to Bretaigne were entred the Saisnes, the kynge
Amaunt be-thought hym that he myght come neuer in better
poynt to conquere his Castell that he so longe hadde loste, and
sente after peple and assembled   <MILESTONE N="124a" UNIT="folio"/>vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and rode forth till he
com in to the launde ther as was the kynge Galad, and hys peple
that were x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, that a-bode ther for drede of the grete water that

Merlin made to apere.  The friday erly in the witsonwike, that
was a feire morownynge and a softe, and yet was not the water
ne the enchauntement lefte, the sarazins lepte to horse and rode
forth her wey, but thei hadde but litill wey riden, whan thei
mette the kynge Amaunt, that rode towarde the Castell of Carroye
with all his hoste.  Whan the kynge Galad saugh the kynge
Amaunt he ran vpon hym, for he wende that it hadde be the peple
of kynge leodogan that hadde hem pursued; and thei were well
horsed on bothe partyes, and smyten to-geder fiercely, and be-gan
a grete bataille and fell, for ther were many goode knyghtes and
sure, and the bataile be-twene hem dured all the day.  But more
of hem speketh not the booke at this tyme, but returneth to kynge
Arthur and kynge leodogan, and his felowes Nascien, and
Adragain, and hervy de rivell.</P><P>  Whan Arthur hadde take vp the swerde that was lefte in
his shelde and hadde shewed to his felowes thei were
gladde, for moche thei hym preised and comended, and than thei
toke theire wey towarde Danablaise.  And whan thei wende haue
ben in the streight lane, thei wente oute of her weye, for thei
fonde on the lifte side an olde wey that was moche and grene,
and grete shadowe of grete wode full of leves, as in the moneth
of may, and a litill was it derke, for the mone was not vp, that
was at fulle thre dayes be-fore; and whan thei hadde gon a-while,
thei herkened and herde grete noyse of strokes in the foreste of a
bataile, and thei drough that wey as the lane hem ledde, and as
thei com nygh, thei vndirstode the voise of theire peple that yet
were fightinge with the Geauntes, that thei hadde chaced in the
foreste.  Than thei drough towarde the noise that thei herde, and
lefte her wey and gan ride faste, and the mone was risinge, and
as thei com nygh thei saugh a grete bataile of thre knyghtes, that
full harde foughten agein   . sarazins.  And whan thei com so
nygh that thei myght hem kenne, Arthur knewe it was Guyomar
and ydier, but of Synados wiste noon of hem what he was, saf that
thei saugh he was wight and hardy; and hem preised moche the
vij felowes, that com nygh to the bataile, and lete renne theire
horse so faste, that thei made hem alle to fremysshe, and leide on

<EPB/><PB N="352" ID="pb.352"/>

grete strokes on bothe sides, and many thei sloughen and some
caste to grounde wounded sore, and Arthur assaied right well his
swerde Marmyadoise, that he conquered of the kynge Rion, ffor
the storie witnesseth that he his owne body slough of hem
x.  And whan the thre knyghtes saught that thei hadde so riche
socour, thei yaf hem a fressh assaute, and eche of hem thre bar
oon to the grounde, and in short tyme thei hurlled hem so, thei
and the thre knyghtes   <MILESTONE N="124b" UNIT="folio"/>that were com hem to socoure, that thei
haue alle slain saf v, that turned to flight down the wode, and
thei after that were full talentif hem to sle, yef thei myght hem
take; but litill while hadde thei chaced these v, whan thei herde
medlinge, and harde strokes vpon sheldes, and vpon helmes, that
all the wode ther-of resounded.  Than spake the kynge Ban to
the kynge Bohors, and seide that all nyght be-houeth hem to
disporte in bateillinge, and the kynge Arthur seide, "That pleseth
me well till that I haue well assaide my goode swerde."</P><P>  "How, sir," quod the kynge Ban, haue ye not yet well it
proved and assaied at thys firste enuaie?" "No," quod
Arthur, "for thei were to fewe peple, and on that othir side ye
and other so hem so arayed that I myght it not assaye at my
volunte."  Than at this wordes loughen alle the knyghtes, ffor
well hadde thei seyen his prowesse that he hadde don, and seide
that he sholde be a noble knyght yef he myght live to age.  And
as thei spake thus, thei approched the bataile that was grete and
felenouse, and than thei saugh C sarazins that fought a-gein xij
knyghtes, where-of foure of hem were on foote, and viij on horse,
that right well hem deffended, and thei that were on foote
deffended hem right well and stronglich, and than thei knewe
well, that thei were of her companye, that com with hem to
Tamelide alle xij.  And the foure that were on foote, that oon
was Antor, and that other Gosnain, and the thridde Gales, and the
fourthe Blioberis, and the fifte ly lais þe hardy, that was smyten
down in sight of hem alle, but vigerously thei hem
deffended.  And whan Arthur saugh Antor on foote hit nedeth not to aske, yef
he ther-fore were angry, for he shewed it well in grete haste, ffor
he priked in to the presse with swerde redy drawen, and smote

so the firste that he mette that he slitte hym to the girdill, and
after the secunde that the hede fill to grounde, and than the

knyghtes that were come to the socour, and by theire prowesses

force.  But sore were thei oppressed, ffor bothe were thei on foote, and
ofte fill thei on knees.  When Merlin and the other companye
come to the medle that so hadden dured of the two knyghtes, tho
was the kynge leodogan fallen to the erthe, ffor he was so wery
for trauaile of strokes that he hadde yoven and receyved, that he
myght no lengere sustene, for all day hadde the kynge endured
traueile of strokes, and ther-to hadde he no myster, ffor he was
of grete age.</P><P>  Whan the Geauntes saugh the kynge leodogan so wery that
he myght no lenger sustene on his feet for the traueile
that he hadde all the day endured in the bataile, so that he lay at
the erthe, and ther was no man that hadde seyn hym in that
plite but he wolde haue hadde pite.  Whan the kynge was fallen,
the Geauntes spored theire horse that wey who that myght
sonneste that noon a-bode other, ffor thei wende a-noon hym to
take or to sle at hir wille; but Cleodalis strode ouer hym with
his swerde in his hande that so well hym diffended that noon was
so hardy to sette on hym hande; and thei hym assailed full
harde, and launched at hym speres and swerdes, and perced his
hauberke in many places, and wounded hym full sore; but for
noon hurte ne wounde that thei hym made wolde he not forsake
his lorde.  And at laste the kynge a-roos, and gan to helpe
Cleodalis with all his power, for he hadde ben a noble knyght in
his yowthe, and he hadde grete pite of hys stiward Cleodalis,
that so a-bandoned his body for the diffence of hym; and than
he seide a pitouse worde, "Ha! Cleodalis," qoud he, "I crye
the mercy of the trespace that I haue don a-gein the, ffor I se
well I am come to myn ende;" and ther-with he fill on kne to

that he putte hym in   <MILESTONE N="125b" UNIT="folio"/>his mercy, he wept tendirly and reised the
kynge be the hande and claymed hym quyte of alle trespaces;
and while he lifte vp the kynge a grete Geaunte smote Cleodalis

well from them that wolde hym haue take; and thei hym assailed
harde and hurte hym that he gretly a-peired, but soone thei made
hym to falle down by Cleodalis; and whan Cleodalis saugh hym
down he lept vp on foote as lifly as he hadde noon harme ne
dissese, and yet was he full dispitously wounded.</P><P>  Thus diffended the ton the tother whan thei fellen; and whan
Cleodalis was so mate that he myght no lenger helpe, than
diffended the kynge, and whan the kynge was so feinte that he
myght no lenger, he cried and seide to the stiward, "Ha!
Cleodalis, feire frende, diffende youre body, for I may no
lenger."  And he lept vp, and bad hym be sure and haue no drede while
that he myght lyve.  Thus contened these two goode men a-boute
mydnyght, and than com Merlin prikinge and his companye; and
a-noon Merlin cried to his felowes, "Now let se who is a knyght;
here may ye prove youre hardynesse and youre prowesse, and be
not dismayed though thei be many, for ye shull haue socour of a

thei harde rescowed and sette on horse who it grucched, and than
were thei xxv knyghtes full noble men and well helpinge, and
many thei kilde and maymed.  But whan Isdras and Acalas and
Colocallus saugh the grete damage that so small peple hem dide,

and a litill a-fore day Merlin come a-gein with xx knyghtes in
his companye; and thei smote in to the medle a-noon as thei

but well it shewed by theire armes that thei hadde not alwey

thei were full noble and hardy, and Merlin was a-monge hem,
that bar the dragon; and than he com to Arthur and to the
kynge Ban and to the kynge Bohors, and cleped hem to hym, and
thei com.  "Will ye wite," quod Merlin, "how these shull be
discounfited?"  And thei seide that thei wolde fayn knowe in
what manere.  Quod Merlin, "Ther ben but foure in this place
that hem holde to-gether."  "And whiche ben thei?" quod kynge
Ban.  "Sue me," quod Merlin, "and I shall hem yow
shewen."  Than Merlin smote in to the presse so harde that he bar down
with his horse breste whom that he mette, and bar the dragon in
his hande, that yaf so grete light that oon myght well se a-nother;
and whan Merlin mette the thre kynges he shewde hem to the
kynge Arthur, and seide, "Now may ye assaye the gode swerde
that ye haue conquered."  And he be-heilde hym that he hadde
desired gretly for to seen, and thought wele that it were thei

that Merlin hadde spoken of; but neuer so soone myght he not
come, er Nascien mette with the kynge Colocaullus and smote
hym with his swerde vpon the helme that he slitte his heede to
the teth, and he fill down deed.  "Now let se," quod Merlin,
"what ye will do, for now is ther oon lesse."  And Arthur, that
hilde the goode swerde drawen, smote the kynge ysdras, that he
made the heede falle to grounde; and the kynge Ban smote Acolas,
that the shulder disseuered from the body so depe that the longes
apered; and the kynge Bohors smote Dodrilas an Amyrall thourgh
the helme to the brayn.  And whan the other felowes saugh how
these foure hadde don so well, than thei yaf hem a fressh assaut,
that there was noon but he made a sarazin falle to grounde, owther
deed or wounded.  And whan the Geauntes saugh hem deed that
were lordes and her gouernours, and the grete damage that these
hem diden, thei seide that a grete fole were he that wolde suffre
to be slain; and than thei turned to flight thourgh the foreste
that noon ne a-bode other.  And thei wolde hem haue enchaced,
  <MILESTONE N="126b" UNIT="folio"/>but Merlin seide "Nay, recche not hem nothinge yow to chace,
ffor soone shull thei mete with folke that shall do hem I-nough of
sorowe and care."  And than thei gan to repeire a softe paas till
thei come to the issu of the foreste, and than gan it to shewe day,
whan thei com to the tentes ther the cristin were logged, and the
wacche hem knewe and com hem a-geins and made of hem grete
ioye, ffor well thei wende that alle hadde ben deed; and a-noon
was the tidinges knowe thourgh the hoste that com was the kynge
Arthur and his companye.  And the kynge leodogan made
appareile her mete grete plente, for thei hadde fasted longe, but first
thei slept and rested; and whan thei weren vp and redy thei ete
and dranke grete plente, ffor I-nough thei hadde wher-of, and
also thei hadde it well deserued; and whan the clothes and the
bordes weren vp, thei dide geder all the grete auoir that thei
hadde conquered, and sette it all on an hepe; and Arthur it
departed be the counseile of Merlin, that the kynge leodogan
wolde not medle ther-in, for nothinge neuer after he hadde yoven
his doughter to kynge Arthur, and that he knewe hym and the
tweyne noble kynges that with hym weren, he wolde nothinge

yonge bachelere, that wolde ought gete or wynne and go with hym
ther as he wolde hem lede, and he wolde hem yeve so moche at
theire repaire, that neuer after sholde thei be power.  And than
ther com so many of oon and other, that it was a wonder, ffor
moche thei desired to be in his companye for the grete valour that
was in hym euer more; and than thei swore and seiden that thei
sholde hym neuer faile.  And he with-hilde in to a xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> <HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and

moche he seide, that yef nede were and that he sente for hem, that
thei sholde come to hym.  And thei ansuerde, and seide thei wolde
with goode will, were it neuer in to so straunge londe thei wolde
hym serue.</P><P>  And than departed thei a-sonder, and the kynge Arthur, and
the kynge Bohors, and the kynge leodogan, and the

Castell of Charroye with-oute eny encomber, and ther thei made
of the kynge Bohors grete ioye, ffor longe hadde he not be ther
be-fore, and ther he a-bode viij dayes full.  But now resteth the tale
a-while of hym and of his felowes, and of the kynge Arthur and
his companye, and returne to speke of the kynge Amaunt,   <MILESTONE N="127a" UNIT="folio"/>that

the bataile dured so all day, that alle the x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> were disconfited

ne hadde ben oon a-uenture, ffor the meyne of ysdras, that were
well v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, that all nyght hadde foughten with the kynge Arthur in
the foreste, happed to falle to hem, and that was for hem gret
myster, ffor the x<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> were so beten and slain, that ther was lefte
but v<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>.  Ther was stronge stour and mortall, for thei were at
grete myschef the peple of kynge Amaunt.  But yet this helped
hem wele, for the sarazins weren wery for trauaile, and that all
day be-fore hadde foughten in bataile, and waked all nyght, and
ther-fore thei were the more hevy and at mysese; but so fought
thei on that oon part and on that other, that the kynge Galad
turned to the flight all disconfited, and ne escaped past vij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> that
alle ne were slain and hewen, and of the peple of kynge Amaunt
ne lefte not right many.  Ther hadde the kynge Amaunt grete
losse of peple, and grete doell made thei that were lefte a-lyve
for her frendes.  That nyght logged Amaunt and his men by a
launde side in the wode, and were full mate and pensif for her
kyn and frendes, that thei saugh ly in myddes of the launde, and
made so grete sorowe, that of all that nyght thei neither ete ne
dranke."</P><P>  On the morowe were the bodies sought, and leide on a
mounteyne, and made grete diches in the erthe, and caste in the
corses, and while thei thus were at soiour, ther com tidinges how
the kynge Bohors was come to the Castell of Charroye for to se
the place, for longe hadde not he ben there, and than the kynge
Amaunt enquered how moche peple he hadde brought in his
companye, and it was tolde hym, that thei myght well be vj<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1>, and
than he seide to his counseile, that he wolde not entre in to the
londe, for hym was lefte so small peple, but he wolde aspie to
a-bide hym in some place on the wey, ffor thei ben but v<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> and we
ben yet vij<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1>, and yef thei come I hope to spede all other-wise
than and thei a-bide.  Thus devised the kynge Amaunt his volunte
where-of he myght wele have a-biden yef hym hadde liked; but
many a man weneth to a-venge his shame that it doth
encrece.  But now cesseth a litill while of the kynge Amaunt and of kynge
Bohors till a-nothir tyme, and speke of the kynge Arthur and his

kynge leodogan to the kynge Arthur, and hym somowned to
spousen his doughter Gonnore; and Merlin seide that he moste
firste do a-nother grete werke; and the kynge asked what;   <MILESTONE N="127b" UNIT="folio"/>and
Merlin seide that he moste firste passe in to the reame of Benoyk,
and tolde hym for what nede; but that was in counseile, for he
wolde not haue the thinge knowen of no man that sholde go
thider.  And whan he herde the nede, he praide hym to repeire
a-gein as sone as he myght.  And Merlin seide he neded not
nothinge ther-of hym to prayen, and bad make hem redy, "for
to-morowe moste we remove."  Quod Arthur, "Shall we not
a-bide the kynge Bohors, that is at the Castell of
Charroye?"  Quod Merlin, "Ye shull a-byde hym at Bredigan, youre

appareilleden, and on the morowe sette hem on here wey.  And
so departed the kynge leodogan and the kynge Arthur, and kisten
at the departynge; and Gonnore hym praide soone to come a-gein,
"ffor neuer," quod <CORR SIC=" ">she</CORR>, "shall I be in ese of herte vn-to the

toke a messager, and sente to the Castell of Charroye to the kynge

pleyes and caroles that Gynebans hadde made for his love, and
than lough Arthur, and seide to the kynge Ban that this mariage
wolde he haue stole hadde no Merlin I-be.  And thus thei laughed
and iaped, and the kynge Ban asked of Merlin, yef he knewe
what the knyght was, that sholde make the Carole to cesse, and
Merlin seide that he was not yet nother gete ne born, and
ther-fore ne enquereth no more ther-after, for ye shull wite more at

were not parceyved till thei saugh the kynge Bohors come; and
on that other side the kynge Bohors com ridynge till he com ther

that was com thider hym for the espie; and whan he vndirstode
that, than he drough hym a litill a-side by a river and comaunded
hys men hem to arme hastely.  Thus were bothe partes armed

and whan thei saugh that thei sholde mete, the kynge Bohors
sente to the kynge Amaunt for to come speke with hym sool

knyght and a trewe; and as soone as thei were mette, than seide
the kynge Amaunt, "Sir, this is soth that ye haue sente for me

wolde not be his man, and yaf it to me for to kepe, for many day
I haue hym serued.  And yet shall I make to yow a feire plee:
com with me to Bredigan where the kynge Arthur me abideth,
and do hym homage, as the barouns seyen that ye owe for to do,
and I shall yelde yow the castell all quyte."  "Will ye noon
othirwise do?" quod the kynge Amaunt.  "Sir," seide the kynge
Bohors, "no; for of yow I holde right nought, but be-come
trewe liege man to the kynge Arthur, and I shall yelde yow the
castell that I haue in my baillye."  "That will I not do," quod
the kynge Amaunt, "ffor neuer will I ben his man."  "And
seth ye will not leve my counseile, that I can no more

to-geder it may not be with-oute grete harme on bothe sides, but
ther-fore lete vs do in other manere.  Ye be here for the right of
kynge Arthur that ye holde for lorde; now lete vs than fight
to-geder body for body, by this couenaunt: that yef ye me
conquere the Castell to be youre quyte, and I to go with yow to
Bredigan and do homage to the kynge Arthur for all my londe,
I and alle my barouns; and yef it be so that I yow conquere,
yelde me the Castell and go yowre-self quyte, for other thinge of
yow will I not aske, and thus may ye eschewe alle periles and
stintyn alle strives."  "And yef oon of vs dye," quod the kynge
Bohors, "what shall come ther-of thanne?"  Quod Amaunt, "Yef
ye me sle, my men shull go with yow, and do homage to the kynge
Arthur; and yef so be that ye be slain, the Castell to be myn,

that ye will do? so wise a man as ye be, ought not soche thinge
to vndir-take to put hym-self in a-uenture of deth for covetise of

wite ye well, than," quod Geromelans, "yef yow mys-happe, as
god diffende, we will make hym noon homage, ne the kynge

the kynge Bohors vndirstode the contencion of the kynge and his

wolde he make no pleet, ne noyse to no man of his companye, of

hem comaunded; and whan Amaunt herde this he comended hym
moche.  Than he com in to the myddill of the launde, where the
kynge Bohors a-bode redy, and a-noon as the kynge Amaunt was
comen, thei with-drough a-side of bothe parties, and thei moved
  <MILESTONE N="130a" UNIT="folio"/>a-noon as thei that thought longe it taried er the bataile were
be-gonne.  Thei leide theire speres be-fore theire brestes, and
smote theire horse with the spores, and mette vpon the sheldes
and with helmes, and hurteled so to-geder, that eche of hem was
so a-stoned, that hem semed that the fire fill oute of her
iyen.  And it fill that the kynge Amaunt fell of his horse to grounde so
astonyed, that he wiste not whether it was nyght or day; and so
he lay longe while at the erthe.  And the kynge Bohors was also
so sore astonyed of that harde encountre, that he lay longe while
vpon the arson of his sadill; but well he kepte hym from fallinge,
for he was of grette prowesse, and a-roos lightly and drough oute
his swerde, that was of grete bounte, where-with his sone Lyonell
afterwarde yaf many a grete stroke, as ye shull heren her-after
rehersed whan tyme cometh.</P><P>  As soone as the kynge Bohors hadde oute his swerde he smote
faste a-boute hym, and wende to fynde the kynge
Amaunt.  Than he be-helde and saugh he lay at the erthe vp-right, and he
helde the swerde in his honde all naked, and griped his shelde,
and come to hym that yet lay on the grene, and putte the poynte
of his swerde on his shelde and be-gan to pouke hym, and cleped,
"Rise vp, kynge Amaunt, for to longe haste thow slepte and the
day passeth, and I haue moche for to ride, and ther-fore thow
doste no curteysie to tary me so longe."  After a longe while the
kynge Amaunt com oute of swowne, and hadde herde the kynge
Bohors clepe, and vndirstode what he seide, and preised hym
moche in his herte for that he hadde so longe a-biden hym
with-oute smytinge, and that he was more curteyse and deboner than
he wolde haue ben to hym yef he hadde ben in his power.  Than
he lepte vpon his feet lyghtly and drough oute his suerde oute of
scauberke that was full fyn, and was a-shamed for that he hadde
founde hym at erthe ligginge; he couered hym with his shelde,
and com to the kynge Bohors and caste at hym a stroke, and he

caste his shelde ther a-gein, and he smote so harde that he slitte
it to the bokell; and the kynge Bohors yaf hym a-gein soche a
stroke thourgh the helme that he slytte it in two partyes, that it
fill down a-boute his sholderes that it toke a-wey his sight from
his hede.  Whan he felte hym-self so blynded he lepte bakke and
cutte a-sonder the laces of his helme and caste it a-wey, and than
couered hym with his shelde, for sore he douted his heede,
whereon was no more but the coyfe of mayle.  Whan the kynge
Bohors saugh the kynge Amaunt that so hadde loste his helme,
he cleped to hym and seide, "Kynge Amaunt, come make pees
with the kynge Arthur, and do hym his homage, for grete damage
it were yef thow sholdest here thus dye, ffor thow seiste how it is
the be-fallen, and yet thou art of feire age, and me hevyeth sore
the to sle."  "But thow," quod the kynge Amaunt, "yelde the
and putte the in my mercy.  Trowest thou me so soone to haue
conquered, for myn helme that I have caste of,   <MILESTONE N="130b" UNIT="folio"/>that dide me but
noye.  Now deffende the, for I the diffye," and with that the
kynge Amaunt ran on hym right wroth, and wende to smyte
hym on the heede, but the kynge Bohors, that moche cowde of
skirmerie, resceyved the stroke on his shelde, and he smote so
harde that a gret quarter fill on the launde.  Than launched oute
the kynge Bohors a grete stroke, and made semblaunt to smyte
ther as he wolde not, and Amaunt caste ther agein his shelde,
and the kynge Bohors with-drough his stroke a-nother wey,
and smote the kynge Amaunt on the heede, that he cleft hym
down to the sholderes, and he fill deed to the erthe
vp-right.  Whan the kynge Bohors saugh the kynge Amaunt dye, he was
right sory, and seide he hadde leuer haue take hym, quyk,
and that he sholde haue made his pees with the kynge
Arthur.  And whan Guygebresill, and Brandelis, and Guyromelans saugh
the kynge Amaunt was deed, thei turned with CC knyghtes,
and seide that neuer sholde thei love the kynge Arthur, ne
no man that to hym belonged; and CCC be lefte, and seide
thei wolde go with the kynge Bohors to the kynge Arthur
and do theire homage, ffor a better lorde than he myght thei
noon haue.


<EPB/><PB N="369" ID="pb.369"/>
</P><P>  Whan the kynge Amaunt was deed the kynge Bohors cleped
hys companye, and seide that gladly wolde he ther make
an hospital where-ynne a man myght euer after serue oure lorde
god for the soule of hym as longe as the wolde dured, and that
oure lordes body myght be sacred ther-ynne, and his seruyse seide
and don, for the victorye that god hadde hym yoven.  Ther was
a clerke that many a day hadde hym serued, and he com be-fore
the kynge and asked of hym this yefte, and seyde he wolde gladly
a-bide there yef hym liked; and the kynge hym graunted, and yaf
hym rentes, and lefte with hym of his auoir grete plente for to
make the hospitall, and ther lefte the clerke in this manere, that
was after a goode man and a holy of lif.  And whan the kynge
Bohors hadde made entiere the kynge Amaunt, and by-sette the
rentes to the clerke, he rode forth till that thei com to Bredigan,
where that he fonde the kynge Arthur, and the kynge Ban, his
brother, and Merlin, that to hym made right grete ioye.  As soone as the
kynge Bohors was a-light, he seide to the kynge Arthur, "Sir,"
quod he, "here be a party of the knyghtes of the kynge Amaunt,

homage and holde theire londes of yow, and thei be worthi men
and riche and high Barouns, as I am do to vndirstonde, of the
beste of that londe.  Now, take theire homages, and hem resceyveth
as ye owe to do."  And the kynge Arthur seide "thei be welcome,
and wite thei right well, that neuer will I do to hem but well
while that thei will me love, ffor thei love me and I will love
 hem, and yef thei me hate I shall hem haten."  And these com
forth and dide hym homage a-bouten CCC; and whan thei hadde
don theire homage the kynge Arthur asked hem tidinges of the
kynge Amaunt, and what man he was in his contrey; and thei
gonne to wepe sore, and seiden how he was deed.</P><P>    <MILESTONE N="131a" UNIT="folio"/>"How," qoud Arthur, "sey ye trouthe that he is

tolde all the trouthe how the kynge Amaunt departed oute of his
londe for to go to the Castell of Charroye, and how thei wente
be-fore in to the wey, ther the kynge Bohors sholde come for to

the kynge Amaunt was deed, and tolde hym all theire traueyle,
that nothinge lefte thei vn-tolde that thei cowde on

prowesse that the kynge Bohors hadde don thei were gladde, and
preised hym moche and comenden; and alle men seiden a-noon
as thei it wisten, that neuer hadde thei herde of two so noble
men as were the two bretheren, and seide well that yef thei two
ne hadde not ben, the kynge Arthur hadde all loste.  Thus thei
soiourned at Bredigan thre dayes full, and than sente the kynge
to enquere for workemen and labourers with mattokkes and
shoveles till he hadde well v<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1>.  Than thei wente to the tresour,

and fonde the tresour that neuer er was seyn, and toke it oute of
the erthe, and charged Cartes and Chariettes in tonnes, that thei
hadde brought thider grete plente; and whan thei hadde all the
tresour charged, thei made it to be condited to logres, where as
Arthurs nevewes dide a-bide.  And Merlin made hem digge depe
vndir an Oke till thei fonde a vessell of lether, and ther-in xij

thei were come to Court, that thei sholde on be emploide.  And
as soone as the children herde speke that the kynge Arthur
hir oncle was comynge, thei lepte on theire horse and rode agein
hym alle to-geder, that noon ne lefte but wente alle gladde and

thei mette the routes, thei asked where was the kynge Arthur;
and thei hem shewde the tre ther he was a-light; and the

Gawein wente be-fore, that thei helde for maister and lorde, and

comaunded the children to go wake in the cheiff mynster till on

wolde leven.</P><P>  Whan it com be-fore the tyme of high messe, Arthur toke
Calibourne, his gode swerde, that he drough oute of the

his nevewe, and than he sette on the spore on the right hele, and
the kynge Ban vpon the lifte hele, and after that the kynge
Arthur yaf hym the acolee, and bad god make hym a gode

Merlin taught; and than the tweye sones of kynge Vrien, and

eueriche of these he yaf a swerde of the tresour; and than the
kynge a-dubbe Seigramor, with soche garmentes as he hadde
brought from Costantynnoble, for he was come well a-raide of
alle thinges that be-hoveth to a newe knyght; and the kynge
girde hym with a gode swerde, that he hadde brought out of

a-dubbed soche companye as thei wolde lede of soche

wente to high messe, that the archebisshop sange, and whan masse
was don thei com   <MILESTONE N="133a" UNIT="folio"/>a-gein to the paleise to mete, and ther helde
Arthur grete court and grete feste, and it nedith not to speke of
the meesse ne the seruise that thei hadde that day, for it were
but losse of tyme; and after mete wolde these yonge bachelers
haue reised a quyntayn in the medowes, but the kynge hem
diffended by the counseile of Merlin, for that the contrey was so
trouble and full of werre, and the cristin sore turmented with
saisnes that were entred in the londe.  Thus lefte the enuysenx
of these yonge bachillers and newe knyghtes at this tyme, and
soiourned in the town iij dayes.  And the kynge departed grete
richesse to yonge bachelers that he with-heilde, that of alle parties
were come grete plentee, ffor ther com so many of oon and other
that thei were lx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> what on horsebak and on foote, with-oute
hem that he hadde brought out of the reame of Tamelide.  And
in the mene-while that thei soiourned in the town, Morgne le fee
a-queynted hir with Merlin, and was with hym so prive, and so
moche she was with hym that she knewe what he was, and many
merveilles he hir taught of astronomye and of egramauncye, and
she helde it right wele.  And on the thridde day spake Merlin to
the kynge, and badde hym appareile for to move, ffor Pounces
and Antony and ffrolle ben entred now in to the reame of
Benoyk, and also the peple of the kynge of Gaule, and also
Claudas the kynge de la desert.  And Arthur seide he was redy
to go whan hym lyked, for he a-bode but his comaundement.


<EPB/><PB N="376" ID="pb.376"/>
</P><P>  Than seide Merlin, "Comaunde alle youre hoste to be redy
armed for to move at mydnyght, and take with yow of
this londe xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> of the reame of Tamelide, and xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> ye
shull leve in this town, ffor this reame may not be lefte
with-oute peple, and lete Doo of Cardoell of hem haue the gouernaunce;"
and thus ended her counseile.  And than the kynge comaunded
Gawein as Merlin hadde seide, and a-noon Gawein dide his
comaundement, and made hem redy appareilled; and hem
departed and disseuered a-sonder, and hem he logged in the medowes
of logres alle that sholde with hem go.  And whan he hadde do
thus he com to the kynge and to Merlin, that he saugh in
counseile to-geder, and seide how all was redy.  And whan Merlin
hym saugh, he bad the kynge aske hym what was the knyght
that ledde hym to socour his moder in the medow of
glocedon.  And he hym turned and seide, "Sir, how knowe ye this, and
who hath this to yow I-tolde."  "Certes," quod the kynge, "he
that tolde me knoweth alle these thinges well I-nough."  "So
helpe me god, sir," seide Gawein, "I knowe not what he was,
for I saugh hym neuer be-fore ne after."  "Now," quod Merlin,
aske hym yef he knewe hym that brought hym the letter from
his cosin Ewein, the sone of kynge Vrien."  And whan Gawein
saugh and be-helde hym that satte by the kynge, he asked whi
he made the kynge hym so demaunde; and than he be-thought
hym a-gein wisely, and remembred the wordes that Doo of
Cardoell hadde to hym seide.  And the kynge asked yef he hym
kenned.  And he seide, "Nay; but oon dide me for to
vndirstonde that it was Merlin, but trewly I knowe hym not; and
many other bountees   <MILESTONE N="133b" UNIT="folio"/>and seruyses hath he me don, ffor
Seigramor, the emperoures nevew, he made me delyuer from pereile of
deth, and my moder, and my cosin Ewein, and also oure-self at
the castell of Arondell, and he is the man of the worlde that I
wolde faynest knowe this day."  "Ye shull knowe hym I-nough,"
quod Merlin, "whan hym liketh."  Than be-gan the kynge to
laugh right lowde, and seide, "Gawein, feire nevew, sitte down
here by me, and I shall telle yow that I knowe."  And he sette
hym down be the kynge, and ther were no mo but thei thre.


<EPB/><PB N="377" ID="pb.377"/>

Than seide the kynge to Gawein, "Feire nevew, lo, here the
gode man by whom ye wente to the Castell of Arondell, where
that ye fought with the saisnes that day that Dodynell the sauage
and Kay destranx and his neveu com oute of her contrey; and
ther-fore now thonke hym of the servises that he hath yow don,
and well ye owe so to do, and to love hym for his gode herte that
he hath to yow."</P><P>  "Sir," seide Gawein, "I can not I-nowgh hym quyte as he
is of worthynesse, but thus moche I sey, that I am all
his and at his comaundement, and he is so wise that knowe I
well that he knoweth all my corage that I haue to hym."  And
he seide, "Ye," that he knewe well his herte, and that he wolde
with hym ben a-queynted and be oon of his privees; but he bad
hym that he sholde not telle no creature of nothinge that he seide
to hym were he neuer so pryve ne frendly; "and ye shull se me,"
quod he, "in so many gises that I will not be knowe of no man,
ffor moche is the enuye for covetyse in this worlde."  And Gawein
seide that neuer wolde he speke ther-of to no creature of the
erthe."  Thus was Merlin aud sir Gawein a-queynted be-fore his
Oncle; and whan thei hadde longe spoke to-geder, than seide
Merlin, "Feire frende, go take youre leve of youre moder, and
than goith to the hoste, and make youre peple go to horse-bak
a-noon after mydnyght, and than goith forth youre wey towarde
Dover to the portes, and do appareille vesselles and assemble
shippes at the ryvage, so that youre vncle, whan he cometh and
the two kynges in his companye, that beth worthy men, may

hem worship and honour, ffor though thei be the kynge Arthurs
men, yet ben thei comen of higher lynage than is he; and loke ye
lete no man knowe what wey that ye shull go."  And Gawein
seide it sholde be don as he hadde devised.  Than departed
Gawein, and toke leve of his moder, that was right wise <CORR SIC="a">and</CORR>
moche hym loved, and comaunded hym to god to diffende hym from
euyll.  And he departed and com to the hoste, he and his brethern,
and sir Ewein, his cosin, that moche hym loved, and Galashin, and
Dodinell, and Seigramor, and Ewein a-voutres, and the foure

cosins that alle were cleped Ewein, and Kay destranx, and
Kehedin, his nevew, these ne departed gladly a-sonder; these hadde
the hoste in gouernaunce, as sir Gawein hem assigned, so that alle
were at the comaundement of my lorde sir Gawein.  And a-noon
after mydnyght Gawein made trusse sommers and other cariage,
and made goode wacche a-boute the hoste,   <MILESTONE N="134a" UNIT="folio"/>that ther ne ascaped
noon aspie; and thei hit kepten that the booke hath rehersed, and
than thei rode forth a softe paas till thei come to the port of
Dover.  And the kynge Arthur a-bode at logres, and Merlin, and
the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and the xlj knyghtes that
thei ledde in to Tamelide, and the knyghtes of the rounde
table.  And sir Gawein made serche all the ryvages, and take shippes
and assembled a grete navie.  And whan Merlin knewe that all
was redy, he sente to the kynge, and made hym move be nyght,
and seide er thei moved, that thei sholde a-ryve at the Rochell, and
badde hem do make her men rowe hem vp thider, "and whan ye
beth a-rived, loke that ye move not till that ye se me a-gein."
Quod the kinge, "Shull ye not than come with vs?"  "No,"
quod Merlin, "but ye shull ly ther but oon nyght, whan ye shull
se me with yow."  With that departed that oon from that other,
and Merlin wente in to Northumbirlonde to Blase, his maister, that
of hym was right gladde, for hertely he hym loved, and asked
hym how he hadde don seth he departed; and he hym tolde alle
the thinges as thei were be-fallen, and Blase hem wrote in his
booke; and whan Merlin com to that he be-hoved to telle of the
damesell that he loved paramours; and Blase was ther-of right
hevy, for he douted she wolde hym disseyve and that she sholde
lese his grete witte, and he gan hym to chastise; and he hym
tolde soche prophesies as were for to come, and of other that
sholde falle in other londes, as ye shull here here-after, and alle

mette firste with Claudas that sore hym peyned to greve the
kynge Ban and his peple, and Sir Gawein lifte vp his swerde
for to smyte the king Claudas vpon the helme, and he hym
couered with his shelde; and Gawein hym smote so harde that
he made it to fle in two parties, and the suerde descended upon
the hynder arson of his sadell and slitte the horse a-sonder, that
bothe fill to grounde, the horse and his maister; and so he rode
forth and no lenger hym a-bode for that he knewe hym not,
and mette so with Mysteres, that was a knyght of Claudas, and
he smote hym on the shulder that he slitte <CORR SIC="hy">hym</CORR> to the breste;

nothinge more than to do hym damage," quod the kynge Ban,
"ffor by hym haue I all my harme that I haue, and that we alle

Claudas de la desert," seide the kynge Ban, "that this day
so sore hath me greved."  "How," seide Gawein, "is this
he that maketh alle these peple here assemble."  "Ye, sir,

whan the kynge Claudas saugh the damage turne vpon hym, he

Agrauain his brother ly on the grounde, and his horse vpon him;
and Gueheret was on foote, with his swerde in honde; and
also he saugh Galashin, his cosin, that ffrolle the Duke of
Almayne helde be the nasell of his helme, and hadde in his

sustened all the bataile a-gein the two thousande that thei myght
not take the thre knyghtes that weren down on foote, and often
thei hem be-raften by fyn force; but now thei ben moche at the
werse for thei ben wery and mate for trauaile; and whan Gawein
saugh the myschef and the pereile of his brethern and his
frendes, he seide to the kynge Ban that he be not displesed,
for I se yonder my brother that I moste go for to socour
and to helpe, for I owe not hym to faile for no drede of

myschef; and than seide the kynge Ban, "Sir, ride forth,
for this may not be taried;" and tho thei rode as faste as the
horse myght hem bere that thei made the renges to sparble

a stronge stour, but Galashin was not all at his ese, ffor he
was yet a-monge the horse feet, and that for thought sore to
Gawein; and he hente a stronge spere and rode thider as
Galashin   <MILESTONE N="140b" UNIT="folio"/>was at soche myschef, and smote in to the presse
so harde that he caste down vij er he myght come ther as

thourgh the shelde that the spere hede stynte at the hauberke
of maile.  But he shof ther on so harde that he bar hym to

made Galashin lepe ther-on, that ther-to hadde grete myster
and hadde gode corage, and gode will to be a-venged of his
damage yef he myght come in place; and so he dide
withynne short tyme after; ffor as soone as he was vpon horse he
smote in to the stour amonge his enmyes, wher he saugh the
Duke ffrolle a-gein sette on horse a-monge his knyghtes and his

shewde to the kynge Ban, and seide, "Sir, se Galashin, my

enmyes."  "Certes," seide the kynge, "who, that hath this
Galashin in his companye may a-vaunte hym-self that he hath

a-baisshed of the perilouse metinges that thei hadde sein; and
whan that the kynge Arthur saugh that these were so ascaped
and medled a-monge the tother, he pressed after hem full
vigerously; and than ther was grete bataile and stronge fight, ffor
ther hadde the coward avauntour no nede to sitte by the

here that haue made yow here to hiden, whan ye sholde delyuer
hem that for yow ben in a-venture of deth, for to helpe delyuer
youre londe of youre enmyes; ffor thei may well sey whan
thei come in to her contrey, that thei haue be in sory seruise
whan ye haue hem lefte in her moste nede that thei hadde of
yowe."  "Trewly, sir," seide the kynge Ban, "we ne did it
but for good."  Quod Merlin, "How-so-euer ye do, euell
haue ye wrought, and therfore loke that the damage that
thei yow haue don be right, dere I solde that thei that yow
ascape haue no cause for to a-vaunten."  "Certes, sir," seide
Gawein, "as for me, I knowe well I haue don right euell,
not for than I shall lete hem well wite that I am not hidde,
yef in me be so moche valoure, though I sholde be deed or
all to hewen, and er I departe that shall thei knowe bothe
the more and the lesse.  Ne neuer cowardise that I shall do
shall neuer the kynge Arthur, myn oncle, be repreved,   <MILESTONE N="143b" UNIT="folio"/>yef
god will while that I lyve, and therfore my frendes and my
felowes and my bretheren, yef ye will be putte oute of blame
seweth me; ffor soone shall be shewed that for cowardise I
am neyther rested ne hidde."</P><P>  Than gan Merlin to laugh, and rode to Kay, the stiwarde,
and hente the dragon oute of his hande, and seide he
was not worthy to bere it; ffor the baner of a kynge sholde
not ben hidde, and namly in bataile, but to be born in the
formest fronte; and than Merlin rode, forth and cried with
lowde voyse, "Now lete se who shall me sewen, ffor soone
shall be shewed who is a knyght."  And whan the kynge Ban
saugh hym go, he seide to kynge Bohors, his brother, that
Merlin hath be a full noble man, and thus seide many of hem,
and with-oute faile he was full of merveilouse prowesse and
strengthe of body, and grete, and longe of stature; but broun he


<EPB/><PB N="406" ID="pb.406"/>

was, and lene, and rough of heer, more than a-nother man; but
he was full well furnysshed of body and of membres, and a
grete gentilman on his moder be-halue; but of hys fader I
sey yow no more, for I-nough ye haue herde; but we finde
not that euer he leyde honde on eny man for to do harme;
but ofte whan he was in prees of peple, and bar the baner,
with the breste of his horse he bar down, bothe men and
horse.  Whan Merlin hadde take the dragon out of Kayes hande he
rode formeste vpon a blakke horse that was stronge and swyfte,
and whan he approched nygh the bateile he drof in a-monge
hem so harde, that alle thei fremysshed and brunt ther as
Pounce Antony faught, that sore hym peyned for to discounfite
hem of Logres, and well he wende that alle the beste knyghtes
hadde be slain, and therfore were thei full of hevynesse in the
castell of Tebres, and ronne to armes moo than xxvii squyers,
and issed oute alle on horsbakke, and Banyns hem ledde that
was godsone to kynge Ban, and sone to Grascien of Trebes,
and he was yet but xx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> yere of age, and was of grete
hardynesse, and a-noon smyten in to the bataile and dide right well
as of squyers for knyghtes were ther noon, and yef that thei
hadde not come so soone the other were euen at discounfiture.</P><P>  Than com Merlin and his companye, that were mo than
a thousande, what oon and other, and he bar the dragon
in his hande that yaf thourgh his throte so grete braundon of
fier that the eir that was blakke of the duste and powder be
com all reade; and thei that neuer hadde it sein be-fore seide
it shewde well that oure lorde was wroth with hem whan he
made soche a signe to a-pere, and than gan the chaunce to
chaunge fro hem that hadde the better; ffor as soone as thei
were comen, thei dide soche maistries of armes, that alle were
a-basshed that weren hem a-geins, ffor ther dide the kynge
Arthur wondres, for he caste his shelde at his bakke, and hilde
his swerde in bothe hondes that was of grete bounte, and slough
so many that noon myght a-gein hym endure; and the boke
seith   <MILESTONE N="144a" UNIT="folio"/>that he slough mo than two hundred, where-of was grete
harme to cristin that ther were so many deed, and all that


<EPB/><PB N="407" ID="pb.407"/>

was for the reprof that Merlin hym yaf, and he hilde the
reyne of his bridill in his lefte arme, and lete hym go ther
as he wolde, and also the kynge Ban and the Bohors dide
merveiles; ffor sore thei hem peyned to be a-venged of her
enmyes, and were goode knyghtes and hardy, and euer hadde
be a-bove alle the knyghtes that hadde I-ben in theire tyme.</P><P>  Now seith the booke that the kynge Arthur was so depe
paste in to the bateile, that they wiste not where he
was be-come, and so was the kynge Ban and his brother, and
whan the knyghtes of the rounde table it wisten their gan
make soche a disray a-monge hem that noon a-bode other, and
so dide the xl knyghtes that ye haue herde rehersed, and the
xvij yonge knyghtes, and be-gonne so sharpe medle, eche for
other, that noon wiste which wey that thei turned, and ofte
eche of hem loste other that day, and many tymes thei metten
agein; at that returne dide Segramor wondres a-monge his enmyes,
for the storye seith that he was oon of the beste knyghtes of
the hoste; and so dide Galashin that often was he shewed, and
mustred with the fynger on bothe sides, and so dide Ewein
that no man nede sech a beter knyght, and the thre brethern
of Gawein that all day helde to-geder that for nothinge wolde
departe, and wonderly well were thei preised; and on that other
side foughten the knyghtes of the rounde table that noon
myght haue don better, and Adragain and Nascien and Hervy
de revill made the renges to tremble ther as thei wente and
com; but ouer alle other dide sir Gawein well that was so
depe in a-monge his enmyes that noon cowde sey where he
was seth he from hem departed; and thei sought hym sore vp
and down on euery side, and Gawein serched so the renges
that he mette Randolf the Senescall of Gaule, that a-noon he
ran vpon hym, for he was a goode knyght and hardy, and
Gawein hym smote in entirpassinge thourgh the helme to the
sculle, and the horse bar hym forth and the suerde descended
on the horse chyne, and kutte it a-sonder, that bothe fill on
oon hepe; and than happed he mette Dodinell the sauage,
and Kehedin the litill, in his wey that were smyten down of

her horse, and Pounce Antony kepte hem right short, and whan
Gawein saugh hem at soche myschef he turned that wey, and
made soche stightlynge a-monge hem that alle dide resorte
bakke wheder thei wolde or noon, and these lept lightly to
theire horse, ffor their fonde I-nowe in the place, and than thei
helde hem a-boute Gawein as longe as thei myght; but soone
thei haue hym loste that thei ne wiste where he was be-come.</P><P>  Grete was the stour and harde bataile be-fore the castell
of Trebes, for the knyghtes of the rounde table dide
maistres as thei yede sechinge the kynge Arthur thourgh the
bateile, but thei cowde hym not fynde for he was so fer from
hem meddelinge with   <MILESTONE N="144b" UNIT="folio"/>ffrolle and Pounce Antony, that hadde
in her companye vij<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> knyghtes of the beste of her hoste, and
ther the kynge Arthur hadde with hem sharpe medle; but
noon ne durste abide his strokes, and yet he was with-outen
shelde, and he griped his suerde in bothe hondes, and whom
that he raught a full stroke was so harde smyten that noon
armure was his warante fro deth, and whan Pounce Antony
and ffrolle hym sien, a-noon thei ronne vpon hym, and he faught
with hem full harde, and many he slough and maymed a-boute
hym, and than fill that Gawein com that way with suerde in
honde, and thei than fledde on euery side, for his strokes
durste not thei abide were thei neuer so hardy, and whan he
saugh Arthur, his oncle, that faught with Pounce and ffrolle,
and with hem xx knyghtes, and ffrolle hadde hym smyten
with a spere be-twene the shuldres that he made hym to
enclyne on his horse nekke, and yef the spere hadde holden
he hadde fallen to grounde; and whan Gawein saugh the stroke
that he hadde yoven his vncle he was ny wode for ire, than
he putte vp his suerde and spronge in a-monge the Almaynes,
and raced a spere from a knyghtes hondes so felly that he
fill to grounde, and ther-with rode to ffrolle, and whan he
saugh hym come he glenched for the stroke and girde in to
the thikkest presse, and Gawein hym chaced that lightly wolde
not hym leve; but ffrolles knyghtes smote be-twene hem two,
but Gawein hym smot so rudely thourgh the shelde and the

hauberke a-gein the lifte shulder that the heed and the shafte
shewed on that other side, and he swowned for peyne that
he felte, and his men assembled a-boute hym, and grete doell
made, for well thei wende he were deed delyuered.</P><P>  Whan ffrolle was vp of swownynge he made the tronchon
to be pulde oute, and to bynde his wounde that sore
bledde, and lept on his horse as well as he myght for sore it
hym greved, and as soone as Gawein saugh hym falle he
returned to his vncle that full harde faught with Pounce Antony,
and with the peple of Randolf, that was remounted; and
Randolf peyned to a-venge the stroke that he hadde of
Gawein.  Ther-with com Gawein in a-monge hem, and smote a-boute
hym on bothe sides, that he hath delyuered his vncle and
dide soche maistres that noon durste his strokes a-bide, ne holde
place a-gein hem two; than fill that Gawein mette Pounce
Antony, and hym soche a stroke on the sholder that the
swerde kutte the boon, and in the ffalinge he hurte hym sore,
and than he smote Randolf thourgh the helme in to the flesshe
that he fill to grounde all blody, that alle men wende he
hadde ben deed; and that the batailes ruseden and were driven
vpon the bataile of kynge Claudas that faught with leonce
of Paerne and Pharien, and whan alle these baners and alle
these bateiles were assembled, thei smyte thourgh the bateile
of Arthur alle entermedled; and ther than was grete harme
on bothe sides, ffor thei that fledden stynted at the bataile
of Claudas, and whan Arthur saugh hem thus go he cleped
Gawein, and seide, "feire nevew, holde yow a-boute me,   <MILESTONE N="145a" UNIT="folio"/>ffor
me semeth that thei be goynge, and therfore kepe yow with
me."  "Sir," seide Gawein, "thei haue right to go, for the
abidinge here for hem is not goode.  But lete vs go faste after
and helpe thei were discounfited."  "In all haste than," seide
the kynge; and while thei helde this talkynge, the Ban and the
kynge Bohors com on with swerdes naked in her handes, all
blody, and chaced and slough all that thei myght a-reche
before hem; and of this happed well to Randolf and to Pounce,
that thei were horsed a-gein er the chace was be-gonne; and


<EPB/><PB N="410" ID="pb.410"/>

whan these foure frendes were mette thei made grete ioye,
and than be-gan the chace after the other that fledden, and
hem fill than a-uenture that thei mette thre of her folowes of
the rounde table that well hadde don all the day, and that oon
was Nascien, and that other Adragain, and the thridde hervy
de Rivell, and than were thei vij full noble knyghtes and
hardy; and it was past noone, and the sonne was high and
hoot whan the chace be-gan, and kay fonde the kynges shelde
on the grounde liggynge, and he it saugh he hadde grete drede
that the kynge were deed, and made a squyer take the shelde,
and badde hym folowe after hym, for he wolde loke yef he
cowde finde kynge Arthur.</P><P>  And euer he folowed the chace a-monge other that stynte,
neuer till thei come vpon the bateile of Claudas ther
thei stynte longe, ffor thei were moche peple, and kay folowed
so the chace till he fonde the kynge Arthur and the kynge
Ban and his brother, and he was right gladde that he hadde
hem so founden, and yede to hange his shelde aboute his nekke;
and than com Merlin with the dragon, and cried, "Now on hem,
gentill knyghtes, for alle be thei discounfited."  And Gawein
hadde hente a spere, and spronge be-fore and smote the kynge
Claudas, that he perced the shelde and hauberke, and thourgh
the lifte flanke, and shof ther-on so harde that he bar hym to
grounde vpright, and rode ouer hym on horse-bak, that Claudas
swowned for sorowe; and Gawein leide honde to his swerde
and smote in to the thikkest of the presse, and passed thourgh
the stour as thikke as thei weren entassed, and  his felowes
spake moche of the prowesse that thei saugh hym do; and
Claudas men ronne for to rescowe theire lorde the more and
the lesse, and drough hym oute of the presse with grete peyne,
and sette hym on horse, and ther-with com Agrauain, and
Gueheret, and Gaheries, that wonderly well hadde don all the
day, and whan thei saugh Claudas men assembled thei smote
on hem so harde that thei made hem remeve place.  Ther
was the kynge Claudas a-gein born to grounde, and wounded
in thre places with-oute the wounde he hadde of Gawein that

ner he was the deth, and foule diffouled a-monge the horse
feet; but yet his men haue rescowed hym, but firste hadde
thei grete losse.</P><P>  Grete was the bateile in the medowes be-fore Trebes ther
as Claudas was vn-horsed, and remounted a-gein, and
than fill that her bateiles sparbled a-brode, and that oon smote
in a-monge that other, and tho departed Pounce Antony, and
ffrolle the Duke of   <MILESTONE N="145b" UNIT="folio"/>Almayne, and Randolf of Gaule, and the
kynge Claudas so euyll araied, that vn-nethe myght thei ride,
and the other were not alle in hele, and whan thei saugh the
losse and the damage vpon hem so grete thei were nygh wood
for anger, and asked what wey thei sholden goo.  "Sirs,"
seide Claudas, "I rede we go to the desert, for that is the
beste repeire that we haue; and the nexte, and we shull go
by the foreste in the shadowe vndir molait, and olde wey that
I knowe; but I am so euell a-raied that euell may I endure
to ride," and while thei spake thus com alle the bateiles
to-broken that oon vpon the tother.  Than be-gan the chace so
grete, and the duste to a-rise, that thei knewe not whiche wey
to turne; and the kynge Bans men ouer-threwe and slough so
many, that all the felde was strowed full of deed bodyes and
wounded.  And the kynge Bohors men wente be-fore to the
passages, that thei knewe as soone as thei saugh this
discounfiture, and Arthurs men hem enchaced full harde and strayte
and slowgh, and toke whom thei wolden, and ther the chace
endured in this maner all the day till nyght; and ther thei
hadde prisoners grete plente, and the kynge Claudas, and
Pounce Antony, and Randolf, and ffrolle kepte hem-self as well
as thei cowde; but litill peple thei ledde, ffor the booke seith

</HEAD><P>  Thus were the foure princes discounfited, as ye haue herde
be the witte of Merlin, and whan thei hadde chaced
hem to the nyght, thei returned with grete plente of prisoners,
and com be-fore the castell of Trebes, where thei were loigged in
tentes and pavilouns of thiers that were discounfited, and made
grete ioye and feste all the nyght, for thei fonde the loigginges
well stuffed of all that neded to man, that nothinge failed, and
whan thei were herberowed that nyght wacched the hoste Pharien
and Grascien, that thei were not assailled of somme maner peple,
and the kynge Ban and the kynge Bohors ledde the kynge
Arthur and sir Gawein and the knyghtes of the rounde table,
and the xl knyghtes that ye haue herde named, and the newe
knyghtes in to the castell of Trebes where he made to hem
grete ioye and feste, and were well iijC knyghtes of the contrey;
and that nyght were thei well serued of all that
be-hoved.  But who that was gladde or noon ther was noon like to the
ioye of the two queenes that were sustres, whan thei saugh
theire two lordes that thei hadde so longe desired for to seen,
and thei were yonge ladyes, and of grete bewte; and gretly
thei hem peyned to honour the kynge Arthur, and alle his
companye, wher-to sholde I tarie to reherse theire seruise and
the ese of softe beddes that thei hadde that nyght, ffor thei
were serued richely as worthi men, and after soper thei wente
to reste for ther-to hadde thei nede, ffor thei were wery for
trauaile that thei hadde that day suffred; and Arthur and
Gawein, and Segramor, and Ewein, and Dodinell, and Kay,
and Antor lay in a feire chamber by hem-self, and with hem

<MILESTONE N="146a" UNIT="folio"/>
was Merlin that from hem that nyght wolde not departe;
and the knyghtes of the rounde table, and the newe knyghtes,
and the xl felowes layn in other chambers.  And whan the
kynge Ban and the kynge Bohors hadde hem loigged at ese
thei wente to bedde with their wiffes, and lefte grete torches
brennynge be-fore hem in chambres.  That nyght shewed the
two kynges grete love to theire wiffes.  That nyght the queene
Heleyne conceyved a childe by her lorde the kynge Ban, and
whan thei were on slepe the wiff of kynge Ban fill in to a
merveilouse drem that longe endured, that sore she was
a-feerde whan she dide a-wake, ffor she semed that she was on
a high mountayn, and saugh a-boute her grete plente of bestes
of all maner kendes, that were in a feire pasture of grene grasse;
and whan thei hadde longe tyme fedde hem on the herbes,
ther roos a-monge hem a grete noyse, that thei ronne that oon
vpon the tother to dryve oute of the pasture, and thei turned
in to two pastures; and the two partes wente on oon side and
hem ledde a grete lyon full huge and merveillouse, and on
that other side where as were not so many by the haluendell
was a grete crowned lyon maister leder, but he was not so
grete as the tother.  This lyon crowned hadde in his companye
xviij lyonsewes crowned, whereof eche of hem hadde lordshippe
and domynacion ouer the tother bestes that were turned to
the lyon crowned; and that other lyon that was not crowned
hadde with hym xxx<HI1 REND="sup">ti</HI1> lyonsewes that alle were crowned, whereof
eche of hem hadde domynacion of a parte of the bestes that
were drawe toward the lyon that was vncrowned, and whan
these beestes were thus disseuered and departed, she loked
toward the crowned lyon, and saugh iiij<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> boles that alle were
teyed be the nekkes be-fore a grove, and ete at a rakke small
grasse and herbes that was newe mowen; and for the lyon
vn-crowned semed thei hadde better pasture with the crowned
lyon than hadde he, he ran upon hym for envye for to
bereve hym his pasture, and toke a partie of his bestes that he
made thre grete hepes, and thei lepe to fight with the crowned
lyon that hadde his bestes departed in to xviij mouncels, and


<EPB/><PB N="414" ID="pb.414"/>

in eche mouncell was a lyonsewe that hadde lordshippe ouer hem
to gouerne hem and gide, and the iiij<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> boles that weren full
fierce and full prowde and the xviij mouncels were with the
crowned lyon, and smote be-twene hem the grettest bateile that
she euer hadde seyn or herde speke; but in the fyn the bestes
with the crowned lyon be-houed to turne bakke, and the
crowned lyon was sore a-dredde to lese his pasture; and while
these beestes fought thus, as ye haue herde, the lady semed
that a grete leopart full fierce and the moste prowde that euer
was seyn, com oute of hir right thigh, and wente through
a grete valey that was right depe, and whan he was entred
in to the valey, the lady semed that a grete blaste toke a-wey
her sight that she wiste not where he was be-come; and whan
she   <MILESTONE N="146b" UNIT="folio"/>hadde hym loste he turned toward the beestes that yet
were fightinge, and saugh that the crowned lyon and his bestes
hadde moche the werse, and whan the leopart com oute of
a grete foreste that was sauage, he be-hilde the bataile of the
beestes full longe; and whan he saugh the crowned lyon hadde
the werse, he yede to helpe hym, and ran vpon the beestes
of the lyon vn-crowned that faught with hem so fiercely, that
he made hem resorte bakke, and as longe as he was a-gein
hem myght thei neuer haue the better of the bataile, and
whan the lyon that was vn-crowned saugh he myght not haue
the better while he was a-gein hym, he made departe the
bataile and a-queynte hym with the leopart, till he drough hym
on his partye, and ledde hym with hym.  And the thridde
day be-gan a-gein the bateile of the beestes as it hadde be
by-forn, and the leopart was with the lyon that was
vn-crowned; and the beestes fought so to-geder, that the crowned
lyon turned to discounfiture, and he made signe to the lyon
with-oute crowne that he sholde go crye mercy, and he so
dide, and so was made the pees be-twene the two lyouns in
soche maner that neuer after were in no wratthe to-geder; and
than the lady be-hilde the leopart to wite yef she cowde hym
knowe be eny wey, and at the laste hir thought it was the
same that com oute of hir thigh that was so woxen and


<EPB/><PB N="415" ID="pb.415"/>

a-mended, and hir thought that alle the beestes of the bloy
Breteyne to hym enclyned, and all thei of Gannes and of Benoyk,
and whan he hadde alle the lordship of these beestes she knewe
not where he was be-comen.</P><P>  Thus she a-boode all nyght in this a-vision till it was day,
and than she a-woke all affraied of the merveile of hir
dreme; and when the kynge Ban saugh hir so affraied he asked
hir what her eyled.  And she tolde hym hir dreme as she
hadde seyn in hir slepe, and whan she hadde all tolde, the
kynge seide ther-of sholde come but goode with goddes
grace.  Than thei a-roos and wente to the firste masse bothe the kynge
and his wif as erly as thei myght; but thei wolde not a-wake
the kynge Arthur so erly, ne his companye that slepten sanourly
for the grete trauaile that thei hadde the day be-fore, and the
kynge Ban praied oure lorde with goode herte that he wolde
yeve hym the deth soche tyme as he wolde it aske.  And this
prayour made he many tymes, till on a nyght in his slepe
a voyse seide that his  prayour sholde be trewe, and that he
sholde haue the deth as soone as he wolde it aske the same
day; but ones be-fore sholde he synne dedly in a-voutre er he
dyed, but ther-of no to be dismayed, for he sholde ther-of well
a-corde with oure lorde, and he was right a goode man in his
feith and creaunce.</P><P>  In this dreme that the kynge Ban was, hym thought whan
the voyse departed that it caste soche a crye as it hadde
ben a thunder the grettest and merveillouse that euer he hadde
herde, and he sprange ther-with so sore ther as he hilde the
queene   <MILESTONE N="147a" UNIT="folio"/>in his armes, that nere he hadde fallen oute of the
bedde that was grete and large; and the queene was ther-with
so affraied that she myght speke no worde in a longe while,
and the kynge hym-self so that he wiste not where he
was.  And whan the kynge was come a-gein in to his memorie, he
a-roos and wente to cherche and was shriven, and than herde
the servyse of oure lorde, and euer after as longe as he lyved
was he confessed euery viij dayes, and was hoseled with the
blissed sacrement, and so dide the kynge Bohors, his brother,


<EPB/><PB N="416" ID="pb.416"/>

that was a full goode man, and of holy lyvinge.  Thus was
the kynge Arthur in the reame of Benoyk, he and his men
a moneth, and ronne euery day in to Claudas londes, and
wasted it so that longe tyme after myght he haue no power
to a-rise vpon the kynge Ban; but after he a-roos a-geins hym
by the force of Pounce Antony, and by the force of the kynge
of Gaule, as ye shull heren here-after, and turmented so these
two brethern that he lefte hem noo foote londe, that thei died
in pouerte vpon the grounde, and theire yonge wiffes lefte
with-oute comfort that after were nonnes veilled in the abbey
of the royall mynster for drede of Claudas.  Ne neuer after
myght thei haue socour of the kynge Arthur, for he hadde so
moche to done in his contrey that he myght not come at that
tyme, and so the heires that thei be-gat were longe tyme after
disherited.  But in the ende kynge Arthur hem ther-to restored,
and drof Claudas oute of the londe, and yaf hem the reame of
Gaule, as the booke shall reherse.  But now we shall reste to
speke these thinges till tyme com ther-to and returne to telle
how Merlin departed from the kynge Arthur, and how he
certified the kynge Ban and his wif of dyuers dremes that
thei hadden mette.</P><P>  Upon a day com the kynge Ban to Merlin, and seide, "Sir,
I am gretly in dispeir of a vision that is be-falle to
me and to my wif, wherefore I haue grete nede of counseile;
and ye be the wisest man that now liveth, and ther-fore yef
it plese yow telle me what it be-tokeneth."  "Certes, sir,"
seid Merlin, "in these two a-visions there is grete significacion,
and it is no wonder though ye thereof be dredfull."  Than
asked the kynge Arthur what a-visiouns ben thei, and Merlin
hym tolde euen as the kynge hadde mette in his dreme, that
the kynge hym-self knewe well he seide trouthe.  Whan the
kynge Arthur and the kynge Bohors and sir Gawein herde the
fierce wordes that Merlin hadde seide, thei merveiled sore what
hit myght signyfie, and thoughten I-nough of many thinges,
and than seide the kynge Arthur, "ye haue tolde what were
the dremes.  Now, yef it plese yow, telle vs the be-tokenynges,

<EPB/><PB N="417" ID="pb.417"/>

for it is a thinge that I wolde fayn knowe."  "Sir," seide
Merlin, "of all will I not to yow declare; ne I ought not to
do.  But I shall telle yow a partye that to yow apendeth," and than
he gan to sey,</P><P>  "Kynge Ban," quod Merlin, "hit is trouthe that the
lyon that is not crowned be-tokeneth a prince that
is right riche and mighty of londes, and of frendes that shall
  <MILESTONE N="147b" UNIT="folio"/>conquere xxix reames by force, and make come in his
companye alle these xxix kynges crowned; and that other lyon that
she saugh I-crowned that hadde the xviij lyonsewes signyfieth
a kinge that is right myghty that shall have xviij kynges vnder
hym, that alle shall be his liege men; and the iiij<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> booles that
she saugh be-tokeneth iiij<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> knyghtes, that alle shull be assured
that oon to the tother eche of hem to helpe, and not faile for
no drede of deth, and alle shull thei be the kynges men, and
this prince that I spake of firste shall come vpon this kynge
for to conquere his londe.  But he shall hym diffende as longe
as he may, and whan this prince hath the better of this kynge,
than shall come a knyght vn-knowen that longe hath be loste
and helpe this kynge that the prince may not hym chace oute
of the felde ne discounfite; and this leopart signyfieth this
knyght, ffor like as the leopart fierce and prowde a-bove alle
other bestes, so shall he be the beste knyght that shall be in
hys tyme, and by that knyght shall the pees be made be-twene
the prince and the kynge that so sore shull haue
foughten.  Now," quod Merlin, "haue ye herde your a-vision and the
tokenynge, and now I moste departe for moche haue I to do in
other places," and whan thei hadde I-herde the merveile of the
dreme that Merlin hadde tolde, thei were more a-baisshed and
more pensef than thei were be-fore; and than Arthur asked yef
he wolde declare eny othir wise to theire vndirstondinge, and
he seide, "Nay."</P><P>  With that departed Merlin oute of the kynge Bans house,
where-as the kynge Arthur was with grete companye
of knyghtes, and this was on the feeste of seynt John; and Merlin
wente to his love that a-boode hym at the welle, for to holde


<EPB/><PB N="418" ID="pb.418"/>

the couenaunt that she hadde with hym I-made, and whan she
hym saugh she made to hym grete chere, and ledde hym in to
the chambres so prively that he was not a-perceyved of no man;
and she asked and enquered hym of many thinges, and he her
taught all her askynge for the grete love that he hadde to
hir; and whan she saugh he loved hir so wele, she asked hym
how she myght make a frende for to slepe and not to a-wake
till that she wolde, and Merlin knewe well all hir thought, and
neuertheles he asked her whi she enquered and ye he wiste it
wele I-nough.  Quod she, "for I wolde make my fader a-slepe
alle the tymes that I wolde speke with yow, whos name is
Dionas, and my moder, that thei aparceyve neuer of yow ne me,
ffor witeth it well thei wolden me sle yef thei parceyved of vs
two ought."  These wordes seide the mayden ofte to Merlin,
and it fill on a day that thei were in a gardin by the fountayne
hem to disporte, and were sette vpon an ympe, and the mayden
made hym to slepe in hir lappe, and hilde her so with hym
that Merlyn loved hir merveillously wele.  Than the maiden
required hym so that he taught hir to make oon slepe, and he
knewe hir menynge right wele; but neuertheles he it hir taugght,
bothe that and many other thinges   <MILESTONE N="148a" UNIT="folio"/>ffor so wolde oure lorde; and
he taught hir iij names that she wrote for to helpe hir-self at
alle tymes whan she sholde with hym ly, that were full of grete
force, ffor neuer as longe as thei were vpon hir, ne myght neuer
man touche her flessly; and fro thens-forth she tysed euer Merlin
to come speke with hir, for he ne hadde no power to dele with
hir a-gein her will, and ther-fore it is seide that woman hath
an art more than the deuell.  Thus Merlin a-bode viij dayes
full with the damesell; but we fynde not in no writinge that
euer he required eny vilonye of hir ne of noon other; but she
it douted sore whan she knewe what he was, and ther-fore she
garnysshed hire so a-gein hym; and in tho viij dayes he taught
hir many wonderfull thinges that eny mortall herte cowde
thinke of, thinges paste and of thinges that were don and seide,
and a partye of that was to come; and she putte hem in
writinge, and than Merlin departed from hire and com to

Benoyk, where the kynge Arthur rested, that gladde were whan
thei saugh Merlin.</P><P>  After that Merlin was repeired fro Benoyk as ye haue herde,
Gawein with a grete companye of knyghtes and men
of armes rode in to Claudas londes, and brake the bourghes and
townes, and sette fire all a-boute, that alle the mene peple fledde
the contrey, and these ronne be-fore the yates of de la desert and
distroyed alle that thei myght fynde, and Claudas ne noon of
hys companye ne durste not meve, and than departed from
Claudas, Pounce Antonye, and ffrolle of Almayne, and Randolf
the senescall of Gaule sory and wroth for the losse and damage
that thei hadden, and swore that neuer sholde thei love the
kynge Ban; and as soone as thei myght be a-venged thei sholde
yelde hym his guerdon as for soche seruise.  But some weneth
to a-venge hym of his shame, and he doth it encrece.  Thus
lefte Claudas pore in the Citee de la desert, ffor he cowde not
haue iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men on horsbak, but after he recouerd all his londe
and was riche, as the storye shall declare here-after, be the
helpe of the kynge of Gaule and of Pounce Antonye, that
repeired from Rome with grete power; but it was in euell
hour, for he was slayn by the handes of kynge Ban be-fore
Trebes.  But Claudas hadde so moche peple that he leide sege
be-fore the Castell as ye shull here afterward, whan tyme
cometh ther-to.</P><P>  Whan Gawein and his companye hadde wasted the londe
and the contrey, and taken alle the richesse, he
returned to Benoyk to his vncle; and Merlin was come from his
love and boode after Gawein, and whan he was come thei were
gladde whan thei hym syen, and for the grete richesse that thei
broughten, and ioyfull weren of the victorie that thei hadden;
and on the morowen thei toke theire wey towarde Gannes, a
Citee plentevouse of all goodes, and ther thei were right well
come, for it was right, and the kynge Bohors peyned hym to do
hem honour and well to serue, as he that full well cowde   <MILESTONE N="148b" UNIT="folio"/>it do;
and ther thei soiourned two dayes, and the thridde day thei
rode forth to the Rochell, and ther entred the see.  Whan the

kynge Arthur, and the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and
sir Gawein sholde entre in to the shippes thei toke Merlin in
counseile, and Merlin hem comaunded that as soone as thei were
a-rived at the porte, in no wise that thei tarye not but two
dayes.  But hastely go theire wey in to the reame of Carmelide,
and lede with hem but thre thousande men of armes, and that
thei be chosen of the beste of the hoste.  "Ffeire frende," quod
Arthur, "shull ye not come with vs; thenke ye not to be at
oure mariage."  "Sir," seide Merlin, "I haue a thinge for to
do that I moste nede performe er I come in to the bloy
Breteyne.  But ye shull but litill space be in the reame of Carmelide, er
I shall be with yow;" with that departed that oon from that
other, and Arthur and hys companye wente towarde the see, but
ther-of moste we reste a-while, and speke of Merlin and his
auenturis.</P><P>  As soone as Merlin was departed from Arthur, he wente
in to the forestes of Rome that were thikke and depe,
and in that tyme Julyus Cesar was Emperour; but it was not
that Julyus Cesar that the deed knyght slough in his pavilion
of Perce.  But it was that Julius that Gawein, the nevew of
kynge Arthur, slough in bateile vnder logres at the grete
disconfiture that after was be-twene hym and the kynge Arthur
that hym diffied, and what the cause was <CORR SIC="that Merlin that Merlin">that Merlin</CORR>   wente
that wey, it is reson it be declared.  This <CORR SIC="it">is</CORR>   throuthe that this
Julyus cezar hadde a wif that was of grete bewte, and she hadde
with hir xij yonge men araied in gise of wymen, with whom
she lay at alle tymes that the Emperour was oute of hir
companye, ffor she was the most lecherouse woman of all Rome;
and for the dredde that theire beerdes sholde growe she lete
a-noynte her chynnes with certeyn oynementes made for the
nones, and thei were clothed in longe traylinge robes, and theire
heer longe waxen, in gise of maydenes and tressed at theire
bakkes, that alle that hem saugh wende wele thei were wymen;
and longe thei endured with the Empresse vn-knowen.  In


<EPB/><PB N="421" ID="pb.421"/>

this tyme that the Emperesse ledde this lif, it fill that a mayden
com to the Emperours court that was the doughter of a prince,
and the name of this prince was matan, Duke of Almayne; this
mayden com in semblannce of a squyer, and this matan the
Duke ffrolle hadde disherited and driven out of his londe, and
she com to serue the Emperour, ffor she wiste not where her
fader ne moder were be comen, and she was moche and semly,
and well shapen and demened hir well in all maners that a man
ought, saf only eny vylonye, and neuer was she knowen but for
a man by no semblante, and so a-boode with the Emperour, and
was of grete prowesse, and peyned tendirly to serue well the
Emperour and plesed hym so well that she was lorde and gouernour
of hym and his housolde; and the Emperour hir loved so well that
he made hir knyght atte a feeste of seint John with other yonge
  <MILESTONE N="149a" UNIT="folio"/>squyers, wher-of were mo than CC, and after made hir stiward
of all his londe.  Than the newe knyghtes reised a quyntayne
in the mede of noiron, and be-gonne the bourdinge grete and
huge, and many ther were that dide right wele, but noon so
well as dide Grisandoll, for so she lete hir be cleped; but in
bapteme her name was Anable.  This bourdinge endured all day
on ende till euesonge that thei departed, and Grisandols bar
a-wey the pris a-monge alle other, and whan the Emperour saugh
Grisandoll of so grete prowesse, he made hym stiward of all his
londe and comaunder a-bove alle that ther weren, and Grisandols
was well beloved of riche and pore.  And vpon a nyght after it
fill that the Emperour lay in his chamber with the Emperesse;
and whan he was a-slepe he hadde a vision that hym thought
he saugh a sowe in his court that was right grete be-fore his
paleys, and he hadde neuer seyn noon so grete ne so huge, and
she hadde so grete bristelis on her bakke that it trayled on the
grounde a fadome large, and hadde vpon hir heed a cercle that
semed of fyn golde, and whan the Emperour a-vised hym wele
hym thought that he hadde seyn hir other tymes, and that he
hadde hir norisshed vp; but he durste not sey of trouthe that
she were hys, and while he entended to a-vise hym on this
thinge he saugh come oute of his chamber xij lyonsewes, and


<EPB/><PB N="422" ID="pb.422"/>
  
com in to the courte to the sowe, and assailed hir oon after
a-nother, whan the Emperour saugh this merveile he asked his
Barouns what sholde he do with this sowe by whom these
lyonsewes hadde thus leyn, and thei seide she was not worthi to be
conuersaunt a-monge peple, ne that no man sholde ete nothinge
that of hir come, and Iuged hir to be brente, and also the
lyonsewes to-geder; and than a-wooke the Emperour sore affraied
and pensif of this a-vision.  Ne neuer to man ne to wif wolde
he it telle, for he was full of grete wisdom.  On the morowe as
soone as he myght se the day, he a-roos and yede to the mynster
to here messe, and whan he was come a-gein he fonde the barouns
assembled, and hadde herde messe at the mynster and the
mete was all redy; and whan thei hadde waisshen thei satte to
mete, and were well serued.  Than fill that the Emperour fill
in to a grete stodye, wher-fore all the courte was pensif and
stille, and ther was noon that durste sey a worde for sore thei
dredde for to wrathe the Emperour.  But now we moste turne
a litill to Merlin that was come in to the foreste of Romayne
to certefie these thinges and these a-visiouns.</P><P>  While that the Emperour satte at his mete a-monge his
Barouns thus pensif, Merlin come in to the entre of
Rome and caste an enchauntement merveilouse, ffor he be-com
an herte the gretteste and the moste merveilouse that eny man
hadde seyn, and hadde oon of his feet be-fore white, and hadde
v braunches in the top, the grettest that euer hadde be seyn,
and than he ran thourgh Rome so faste as all the worlde hadde
hym chaced, and whan the peple saugh hym so renne, and
saugh how it was an herte the noyse a-roos, and   <MILESTONE N="149b" UNIT="folio"/>the cry on
alle partyes, and ronne after grete and small with staves and
axes, and other wepen, and chaced hym thourgh the town, and
he com to the maister gate of the paleys where-as the Emperour
satte at his mete, and whan thei that serued herde the noyse
of the peple, thei ronne to the wyndowes to herkene what it
myght be, and a-noon thei saugh come rennynge the herte and
all the peple after; and whan the herte com to the maister paleys
he drof in at the yate sodeynly, and than he ran thourgh the


<EPB/><PB N="423" ID="pb.423"/>

tables a bandon and tombled mete and drynke all on an hepe,
and be-gan ther-in a grete trouble of pottis and disshes; and
whan the herte hadde longe turned ther-ynne he com be-fore the
Emperour, and kneled and seide, "Julius cezar, Emperour of
Rome, wheron thinkest thow, lete be thi stodyinge for it
a-vaileth nought, ffor neuer of thyne a-vision shalt thow not
knowe the trouthe be-fore that man that is sauage the certefie,
and for nought is it that thow stodyest ther-on eny more."
Than the herte hym dressed and saugh the yate of the paleyse
cloos, and he caste his enchauntement that alle the dores and
yates of the paleise opened so rudely that thei fly alle in peces,
and the herte lept oute and fledde thourgh the town, and the
chace be-gan a-gein after hym longe till that he com oute in
to the playn feeldes; and than he dide vanysshe that noon sey
where he be-com, and than thei returned a-gein, and whan the
Emperour wiste the herte was ascaped he was wroth and lete
crye thourgh the londe that who that myght brynge the sauage
man or the herte sholde haue his feire doughter to wif, and half
his reame, yef that he were gentill of birthe, and after his deth
haue all; and lepe to horse many a vailaunt knyght and squyer
of pris, and serched and sought thourgh many contrees, but all
was for nought, ffor neuer cowde thei heere no tidinges of that
thei sought, and whan thei myght no more do thei returned
a-gein.  But euer Grisandols serched thourgh the forestes, oon
hour foreward, another bakke that so endured viij dayes full;
and on a day as Grisandol was a-light vnder an oke for to praye
oure lorde to helpe and to spede for to fynde that he sought, and
as he was in his prayours the herte that hadde ben at Rome
com be-fore hym and seide, "Auenable, thow chacest folye,
ffor thow maist not spede of thy queste in no maner, but I shall
telle the what thow shalt do.  Purchese flessh newe and salt,
and mylke and hony, and hoot breed newe bake, and bringe
with the foure felowes, and a boy to turne the spite till it be
I-nough rosted, and com in to this foreste by the moste vn-couthe
weyes that thow canste fynde, and sette a table by the fier,
and the breed, and the mylke, and the hony vpon the table,

<EPB/><PB N="424" ID="pb.424"/>

and hide the and thi companye a litile thens, and doute the
nought that the sauage man will come."</P><P>  Than ran the herte a-grete walope thourgh the foreste, and
Grisandol lept to horse and thought well on that the
herte hadde seide and thought in his corage that it was somme
spirituell thinge that by hir right name hadde hir cleped, and
thought well that of this   <MILESTONE N="150a" UNIT="folio"/>thinge sholde come some merveile;
and Grisandol rode forth to a town nygh the foreste vij myle,
and toke ther that was myster, and com in to the foreste ther
as he hadde spoke with the herte as soone as he myght, and
roode in to the deepe of the foreste, where-as he fonde a grett
oke full of leves, and the place semed delitable, and he a-light
and sette theire horse fer thens, and made a grete fier, and sette
the flesshe to roste, and the smoke and the sauour spredde
thourgh the foreste, that oon myght fele the sauour right fer;
and than sette the table be the fier, and whan all was redy thei
hidde hem in a bussh.  And Merlin that all this knewe and that
made all this to be don couertly that he were not knowen drough
that wey that he were not knowen with a grete staffe in his nekke
smytinge grete strokes from oke to oke, and was blakke and
rough for rympled and longe berde, and bar-foote, and clothed
in a rough pilche; and so he com to the fier, ther as the flessh
was rosted, and whan the boy saugh hym come he was so a-ferde
that he fledde nygh oute of his witte; and he this com to the
fier and be-gan to chacche and frote a-boute the fier, and saugh
the mete and than loked all a-boute hym and be-gan to rore
lowde as a man wood oute of mynde, and than be-heilde, and
saugh the cloth spredde and soche mete ther-on as ye haue

flesshe that the knaue hadde rosted that was tho I-nough, and
raced it of with his hondes madly, and rente it a-sonder in peces,
and wette it in mylke, and after in the hony, and ete as a wood
man that nought ther lefte of the flessh; and than he eete of the
hoot breed and hony that he was full and swollen grete, and
somwhat was it colde, and he lay down by the fier and slepte;

the tother ende of the cheyne; and whan he was so well bounde
he a-wooke and lept vp lightly, and made semblaunt to take his
staff as a wilde man, and Grisandolus griped hym in his armes
right sore and hilde hym stille, and whan he saugh hym so
bounde and taken, he hilde hym as shamefaste and mate; and
than the horse were brought forth and he was sette vpon oon

sette be-hynde hym that was bounde to hym and enbraced hym

man loked on Grisandolus that rode by hym, and be-gan to
laugh right harde, and whan Grisandolus saugh hym laughe he
approched ner and rode side by side, and a-queynted with hym
the beste that he myght, and enquered and asked many thinges,
but he ne wolde nought ansuere, and Grisandol asked why he
lough, but he wolde not telle.  Saf that he seide, "Creature
formed of nature chaunged in to other forme fro hens-forth

this that he hadde seide spake to his companye, and thei seide
that he was wiser than he shewed, and that som grete merveile
sholde falle in the londe.  Thus thei ride spekynge of many

proudly on trauerse, and seide, "Ymage repaired and disnatured
fro kynde, holde thy pees, ne enquere no mo thinges for nought
will I telle the but be-fore the Emperour;" and whan Grisandolus
this vndirstde, he lete hym be at that tyme and no more thinge

knyght that was in the chapell saugh the man bounde with
chaynes he hadde merveile what it myght be, and while the
knyght be-heilde the man that was sauage, the squyer that was
in an angle be-hynde the chapel dore come a-gein his lorde, and
lifte vp his hande and yaf hym soche a flap that alle thei in the
chapell myght it here, and than returned thider as he com fro
all shamefaste of that he hadde don, and whan he was come in
to his place he ne rofte no-thinge, for the shame lasted no lenger;
but while he was in returnynge, and whan the sauage man
saugh this, he be-gan to laugh right harde, and the knyght that
was so smyten was so a-baisshed that he wiste not what to sey
but suffred; and Grisandolus and the other companye merveiled
sore what it myght be.  A-noon after the squyer com a-gein to
his lorde, and yaf hym soche a-nother stroke as he dide be-fore,
and wente a-gein in to his place, and the sauage man hym
be-hilde and be-gan to laughe right harde, and yef the knyght
be-fore were a-baisshed, he was than moche more, and the
squyer that hadde hym smyten returned sorowfull and pensif to
the place that he com fro, and hilde hym-self foule disceyved of
that he hadde don, and whan he was in his place he rought
neuer, and Grisandolus, and the companye merveiled right sore,
and herden oute the seruise be leyser, and in the mene while that
thei thoughten vpon these thinges that thei hadde seyn, the
squyer com the thridde tyme and smote his lorde sorer than he
hadde don be-fore, and ther-at lowgh the wilde man sore, and
be that was the masse at an ende, and than Grisandolus and
alle wente oute of the chapell, and the squyer that hadde
smyten his lorde com after and asked Grisandolus what man it
was that thei hadde so bounde, and thei seide that thei were
with Julius cezar, Emperour of Rome, and ledde to hym that
sauage man that thei hadde founded in the foreste, for   <MILESTONE N="151a" UNIT="folio"/>to
certefie of a vision that was shewed hym slepinge.  "But, sir,"

seide Grisandolus, "tell me wherefore hath this squyer yow
smyten thre tymes, and ye ne spake no worde a-gein, haue ye
soche a custome," and the knyght ansuerde that he sholde it
wite in tyme comynge.</P><P>  Than the knyght cleped his squyer and asked hym be-fore
Grisandolus wherefore he hadde hym smyten, and he
was shamefaste, and seide he wiste neuer, but so it fill in his
corage, and the knyght hym asked yef he hadde now eny talent
hym for to smyte, and the squyer seide he hadde leuer be deed,
"but that," quod he, "it fill in my mynde that I myght not kepe
me ther-fro," and Grisandolus lough of the merveile.  Than seide
the knyght that he wolde go to court with hem for to here what
the sauage man wolde sey, and with that thei rode forth on her
wey, and Grisandolus by the sauage mannes side, and whan thei
hadde a-while riden, he asked the wilde man wherfore he lough
so thre tymes whan the squyer smote his lorde, and he loked on
hir a trauerse, and seide, "Ymage repeyred semblaunce of

fell wordes that he spake, he was all a-baisshed and pensef,
and durste not no more enquere, and rode forth till thei come

seide, "Sir, haue here the man that is sauage that I to yow
here yelde, and kepe ye hym fro hens-forth for moche peyne haue
I hadde with hym," and the Emperour seide he wolde hem well
guerdon, and the man sholde be well kepte, and than he sente
to seche a smyth to bynde hym in chaynes and feteres, and the
sauage man badde hym ther-of not to entermete, "ffor wite it

the Emperour hym asked how he ther-of sholde be sure, and
he seide he wolde hym asure by his cristyndome.  Quod the
Emperour, "Art thow than cristin?"  and he seide, "Ye
withoute faile."  "How were thow than baptized," seide the
Emperour, "whan thow art so wilde."  "That shall I telle
yow," quod he, "This is the trouthe that my moder on a day
com from the market of a town, and it was late whan she entred
in to the foreste of brocheland, and wente oute her way so fer
that the same nyght be-hoved hir to lye in the foreste, and
whan she saugh she was so a-lone be hir-self she was a-feerde
  <MILESTONE N="151b" UNIT="folio"/>and lay down vnder an oke and fill a-slepe, and than com
a sauage man oute of the foreste and by hir lay, be-cause she
was sool by hir-self.  Durste she not hym diffende, ffor a woman
a-loone is feerfull, and that nyght was I be-geten on my moder,
and whan she was repeired hom, she was full pensif longe tyme,
till that she knewe verily that she was with childe, and bar
me so till I was born in to this worlde and was baptised in
a fonte, and dide me norishe till I was grete, and as soone as
I cowde lyve with-outen hir, I wente in to the grete forestes
for by the nature of my fader be-houeth me thider to repeire,
and for that he was sauage I am thus wilde.  Now haue ye
herde what I am."  "So god me helpe," seide the Emperour,
"neuer for me shalt thow be putte in feteres ne in Irenes
seth thow wilt me graunte that thow will not go with-oute my
leve."  Than tolde Grisandolus how he dide laugh be-fore the
abbey and in the chapell, for the squyer that hadde smyten his
maister, and the dyuerse wordes that he hadde spoken, whan he
asked where-fore he dide laugh, and he seide that neuer wolde
he nought sey till he com be-fore yow, and now is he here, and
therfore aske hym why he hath so often laughed by the wey,
and than the Emperour hym asked, and he seide he sholde it
knowe all in tyme, but sendeth first for all youre barouns and

beholden thei asked why he hadde for hem sente, and he tolde hem
for a vision that hym be-fill in his slepynge, "ffor I will that it
be expowned be-fore yow," and thei seide that the significacion
wolde thei gladly heren.  Than the Emperour comaunded this

laughe right lowde as it were in dispite, whan the Emperour
saugh hym so laughe he preied hym to telle that he hadde in
couenaunt, and whi that he lough now and other tymes, with
that he stode vp and seide to the Emperour so lowde that all
myght it heren.  "Sir, yef ye me graunte as trewe Emperour

he was so desirouse for to heren, and that he sholde haue leve

seide what was youre a-vision, hit is to be-leve the

wolde he soone knowe, and than he cleped Grisandolus, and
seide, "Dispoile mo tho dameseles, for I will that alle the barouns

and other lept forth and dispoiled hem be-fore the Emperour and
his barouns, and fonde hem formed alle as other men weren; and
than the Emperour was so wroth that he wiste not what to

foot, and made hem to be caste in to the brynynge fier, and
in short tyme thei were alle brent, ffor the fier was grete

grete was the renomede that peple of hym spake whan it
was knowen.

<EPB/><PB N="432" ID="pb.432"/>
</P><P>  Whan the Emperesse was brente, and thei that she hadde
made hir maydenes, the barouns returned a-gein to the

right wise and avisee, ffor yet shall he sey some other thinges
wher-of shall come some grete merveile vs, and to all the worlde;
and the Emperour hym-self seide that he hadde seide his a-vision
as it was in trouthe.  Thus wiste the Emperour the lyvinge of
his wif, and than the Emperour hym called, and asked yef he
wolde sey eny more, and he seide, "Ye   <MILESTONE N="153a" UNIT="folio"/>yef he asked hym
whereof."  "I wolde wite," quod he, "wherefore thow didist
laughe whan thow were in the <CORR SIC="freste">foreste</CORR>, and loked on Grisandolus,
and also whan thow were ledde be-fore an abbey, and in the

tho wordes to my stiwarde whan he asked why thow loughe,
and after tell me what be-tokeneth the laughter here-ynne
whan thow saugh the Emperesse come."  "Sir," seide the
sauage man, "I shall telle yow I-nowgh.  I do yow to wite that
the firste laughter that I made was for that a woman hadde me
taken by her engyn, that no man cowde not do; and wite ye well
that Grisandolus is the beste maiden and the trewest with-ynne
youre reame, and therefore was it that I lough; and the laughter
that I made be-fore the abbey, was for ther is vnder erthe
be-fore the yate the grettest tresour hidde that eny man knoweth,
and therfore I lough for that it was vnder feet of hem that
a-boode after the almesse, ffor more richesse is in that tresour
than alle the monkes beth worth, and all the abbey, and all that
ther-to be-longeth, and the pore peple that ther-on stoden cowde

her clepen, saugh that I lowgh and asked me wherefore, and
the couerte wordes that I to hir spake was for that she was
chaunged in to the fourme of man, and hadde take a-nothir
habite than hir owne; and alle the wordes that I spake thei ben
trewe, ffor by woman is many a man disceyved, and therefore
I cleped hir disceyaunt for by women ben many townes sonken
and brent, and many a riche londe wasted and exiled, and moche
peple slayn; but I sey it not for noon euell that is in hir, and


<EPB/><PB N="433" ID="pb.433"/>

thow thy-self maist well perceyve that be women be many
worthi men shamed and wratthed that longe haue loued to-geder,
yef it were not for debate of women; but now rech the not for
thy wif, that thou haste distroied, ffor she hath it well deserued,
and haue therfore no mystrust to other, for as longe as the
worlde endureth it doth but apeire, and all that cometh to hem
be the grete synne of luxure that in hem is closeth; ffor woman
is of that nature, and of that disire, that whan she hath the
moste worthi man of the worlde to hir lorde, she weneth she
haue the werste, and wite ye fro whens his cometh of the grete
fragelite that is in hem; and the foule corage and the foule
thought that thei haue where thei may beste hir volunte
acomplish; but therfore be not wroth, for ther ben in the worlde
that ben full trewe, and yef thow haue be desceyved of thyn,
yet shall thow haue soche oon that is worthy to be Emperesse,
and to resceyve that high dignite, and yef thow wilt it be-leve
thow shalt wynne ther-on more than thowe shalt lese.  But the
prophesie seith that the grete dragon shall come fro Rome that
wolde distroie the reame of the grete Breteyne and put it in his
subieccion; and the fierce lyon crowned maugre the diffence of
the turtill that the dragon hath norisshed vndir his wynges, and
as soone as the grete dragon shall   <MILESTONE N="153b" UNIT="folio"/>meve to go to the grete
Breteigne, the lyon crowned shall come hym a-geins, and shull
fight so to-geder, that a fierce bole that is prowde, whiche the
lyon shall bringe with hym shall smyte so the dragon with oon
of his hornes that he shall falle down deed, and therby shall be
delyuered the grete lyon.  But I will not telle the significacion
of these wordes, for I owe it nought to do, but all this shall falle
in thy tyme, and therfore be well ware of euell counseile, for
grete part longeth to the.  The tother laughter that I made in
the chapell was not for the buffetes that the squyer yaf his
lorde, but for the be-tokenynges that ther-ynne ben.  In the
same place ther the squyer stode was entred, and yet ther is
vndir his feet a merveillouse tresour.  The firste buffet that the
squyer yaf his lorde signifieth that for avoure the <CORR SIC="wolde">worlde</CORR>
becometh so prowde, that he douteth nother god ne his soule, no


<EPB/><PB N="434" ID="pb.434"/>

more than the squyer douted to smyte his maister, but the riche
wolde oppresse the pore vnder theire feet; and that make these
vntrewe riche peple whan enythinge cometh to hem be
myschaunce thei swere and stare and sey maugre haue god for
his yeftes, and wite ye what maketh this nothinge but pride of
richesse.  The seconde buffet be-tokeneth the riche vserer that
deliteth in his richesse and goth <CORR SIC="sornynge">scornynge</CORR> his pore nyghebours
that be nedy whan thei come to hym ought for to borough, and
the vserer so leneth hem litill and litill that at laste thei moste
selle theire heritage to hym that so longe hath it coveyted.  The
thridde buffet signifieth these false pletours, men of lawe, that
sellen and a-peire theire neyghbours be-hinde here bakke for
couetise and envye of that thei se hem thrive, and for thei be not
in her daungier, ffor whan these laweers sen that her neighbours
don hem not grete reverence and servise, thei thenken and
a-spien how thei may hem a-noyen in eny wise, and to make
hem lese that thei haue, and therfore men seyn an olde sawe,
who hath a goode neighbour hath goode morowe.  Now haue ye
herde the significaciouns why the buffetes were yoven, but the
squyer delited nothinge ther-ynne whan that he smote his
maister, but he wiste not fro whens this corage to hym
com.  But god that is almyghty wolde haue it to be shewed in
exsample that men sholde not be prowde for worldly richesse,
for to the couetouse theire richesse doth hem but harme that
slepen in auerice, and for-yete god and don the werkes of the
deuell, that ledeth hem to euerlastinge deth, and all is for the
grete delite that thei haue in richesse.  But now shall I telle
yow whi I lough to day whan I saugh the Emperesse comynge
and hir lechours, I do yow to wite that it was but for dispite,
ffor I saugh that she was youre wif, and hadde oon of the
worthiest men of the worlde that eny man knoweth of youre

for to haue ledde this foly all hir lif; and ther-fore hadde I grete
dispite for the love of yow and of youre doughter, ffor she is
youre doughter with-oute doute, and draweth litill after hir

thei were, and therfore may I go yef it be youre
plesier."  "Now a-bide a litill," seide the Emperour, "and telle vs the
trouthe of Grisandolus, and also we shull sende to digge after
the tresour for I will wite yef it be trewe," and he ther-to dide
assent; than the Emperour comaunded that Grisandolus were
sought, and so she was founden oon of the feirest maydenes that
neded to enquere in eny londe, and whan the Emperour knewe
that Grisandolus, his stiwarde, that longe hadde hym serued was
a woman, he blissed hym for the wonder that he ther-of
hadde.  Than he asked the sauage man counseile what he sholde do of
that he hadde promysed to yeve his doughter, and half his
reame, ffor loth he was to falsen his promyse of couenaunt.  "I
shall telle yow," quod the man, "what ye shull do yef ye will
do my counseile, and wite it well, it is the beste that eny man
can yeven."  "Sey on, than," seide Emperour, "ffor what
counseile that thow yevest I shall it well be-leve, for I haue
founde thy seyinge trewe."  Than seide the sauage man, "Ye
shall take Avenable to be yowre wif, and wite ye whos doughter
she is.  She is doughter to the Duke matan that the Duke
ffrolle hath disherited and driven <CORR SIC="oute oute">oute</CORR>   of his londe for envye
with grete wronge, and he and his wif be fledde, and his sone,
that is a feire yonge squyer, in to Province in to a riche town
that is called monpellier; and sende to seche hem and yelde hem
her heritage that thei haue loste with wronge, and make the
mariage of youre doughter and Auenables brother that is so feire,
and ye may her no better be setten."  And whan the Barouns
vndirstode that the sauage man seide, thei spoke moche a-monge
hem, and seiden in the ende that the Emperour myght do no
better after theire advis; and than the Emperour asked his name,
and what he was, and the hert that so pertly spake vnto hym,
and than seide he, "Sir, of that enquere no more, ffor it is a
thinge the more ye desire to knowe the lesse shall ye
witen."  "Ffor sothe," seide the Emperour, "now suppose I well what
it may be, but shull ye telle us eny more."  "Ye," quod he,
"I tolde yow right now of the lyon crowned and of the lyon


<EPB/><PB N="436" ID="pb.436"/>

volage, but now shall I telle yow in other manere, for that ye
shull be better remembred whan tyme cometh.  Emperour of
Rome," quod he, "this is trewe prophesie that the grete boor
of Rome that is signified by the grete dragon, shall go a-gein
the lyon crowned of the bloy Breteyne a-gein the counseile of
the turtell that hath an heed of golde and longe hath ben his
love.  But the boor shall be so full of pride that he will nothir
be-leve, but shall go with so grete pride with all his generacion
in to the parties   <MILESTONE N="154b" UNIT="folio"/>of Gaule to fight with the crowned lyon that
shall come a-geins hym with alle his beestes.  Ther shall be
grete slaughter of beestes on bothe sides.  Than shall oon of
the fawnes of the lyon crowned sle the grete boor, and ther-fore
I praye the yef thow wilt ought do for me er I departe that
thow do nothinge a-gein the volunte of thy wif, after that day
that thow haste her wedded, and wite well yef thow do thus
thow shalt haue profite, and now I take my leve for here haue
I no more to do."  And the Emperour be-taught hym to god seth
it myght no better be, and ther-with he wente on his wey, and
whan he com to the halle dore he wrote letteres on the lyntell
of the dore in grewe that seide, "Be it knowe to alle tho that
these letteres reden, that the sauage man that spake to the
Emperour and expounded his dreme, hit was Merlin of
Northumberlande, and the hert brancus with xv braunches that spake to
hym in his halle at mete a-monge alle his knyghtes, and was
chaced thourgh the Citee of Rome, that spake to Auenable in the
foreste whan he tolde hir how she sholde fynde the man sauage;
and lete the Emperour well wite that Merlin is maister
counseller to kynge Arthur of the grete Breteyne."  And than he
departed and spake no mo wordes.  Whan this sauage man was
departed from the Emperour, he sente in to Province to seche
the fader and the moder of Auenable and Patrik hir brother, in
the town of monpeller, whider as thei were fledde; and a-noon
thei com gladde and ioyfull of the auenture that god hadde hem
sente, and whan thei were comen thei hadde grete ioye of theire

to here herytage that ffrolle hadde hem be-rafte.  But as ffrolle
myght he it a-gein seide, ffor he was of grete power, and so
endured the werre longe tyme.  But in the ende the Emperour
made the pees, and than he maried his doughter to Patrik, and
hym-self toke Auenable to his wif, and grete was the ioye and
the feeste that the Barouns maden, for moche was she be-loved
bothe of riche and pore, and as the Emperour was in ioye and
deduyt of his newe spouse, ther com a massage to hym oute
of Greece for a discorde that was be-twene the barouns of Greese
and the Emperour Adrian, that sholde hem Iustise, ffor the
Emperour Adrian myght vn-ethe ride for febilnesse of age, and
whan the messagers hadde spoke to the Emperour and don all
that he sholde, he toke his leve to go, and as he caste vp his yie
vpon the halle dore and saugh the letteres that Merlin hadde
writen in griewe, and a-noon he redde hem lightly, and than
he gan to laughe right harde, and shewed hem to the Emperour,
and seide, "Sir, is this trewe that these lettres seyn."  "What
sey thei," quod the Emperour, "wote ye neuer."  Quod the
messager, "Thei seyn that he that tolde yow the vntrouthe of
youre wif, and youre dreme expowned, and spake to yow in
gise of an herte, that it was Merlin of Northumbirlande, the
maister counseller of kynge Arthur of Breteyne, by whos
counseile ye haue spoused youre wif Auenable."  And whan the
Emperour vndirstode   <MILESTONE N="155a" UNIT="folio"/>these wordes he merveiled sore; and than
be-fill a grete merveile, whereof alle that were ther-ynne hadde
wonder, and the Emperour hym-self; ffor as soone as the
Emperour herde what the letteres mente, a-noon the letteres
vanysshed so sodeynly that no man wiste how, and ther-of
hadde thei grete wonder, and moche it was spoken of thourgh
the contrey.  But now cesseth the tale of the Emperour of
Rome that a-bode in his paleise gladde and myry with his wif
Auenable, and ledde goode lif longe tyme, for bothe were thei
yonge peple, ffor the Emperour was but xxviij yere of age at
that hour, and his wif was xxij, and yef thei ledde myri lif, yet
Patrik and ffoldate, the doughter of the Emperour, lyved in more

were so many that of fin force thei droff hem oute of the

"What   <MILESTONE N="157a" UNIT="folio"/>lordynges, wheder will ye go.  Certes full euell holde
ye the promyse that we devised hedirwarde; ffor yet be we
hooll and sounde, and oure armoure hooll also, and we be thus
discounfited that noon of vs dar shewe his valour, wele ought

thei returned a-gein fiercely, and eche of hem smote so the
firste that he mette, that deed he fill to grounde, and ther
be-gan the bataile more crewell than it hadde all the day
be-fore.  Ther dide the kynge de Cent Chyualiers so well that
moche was he preised and be-loved of the high barouns; ffor
er he departed his sheilde was all to daisht, that the thridde part
ne left not hooll, and his hauberke dismayled and his helme
perced, and his armes all be-soiled in blode, and his horse heed
and all the fore body was soyled with bloode and brayn, that

at Hardogabrans tente, where oon blewe a trumpe, and the

alle that thei myght take, that the stremes of blode
ran as of a welle springe, and thus the slaughter endured all
the nyght till it was day; and whan the saisnes saugh the
grette losse and martire that thei maden, thei were woode for
wrath and ire, and than they com on fresshly as though <CORR SIC="the">they</CORR>
sholde haue all confounded in theire comynge, and the cristen
hem deffended in the beste maner.  But yet the saisnes droff
hem oute from the tentes foule and lothly; and than be-gonne
the horse of the cristin to feynte sore as they that two dayes
hadde not eten, and ther-of were thei sore discounforted; ffor
thei saugh that alle were thei in a-venture of deth.  Than
fill the barons in corage as god wolde, the yonge knyghtes that
I haue named be-fore, that thei wolde Iuste with the saisnes
for to wynne hem other horse where-on thei myght ride, or

kynge loot sholde haue theire moder in companye till that he
hadde made homage to the kynge Arthur, and lete hym wele
knowe that he hadde no werse enmy than that thei wolden
be; and how that kynge Arthur hadde foughten with the kynge
Claudas and Pounce Antonye be-fore the castell of Trebes, and<EPB/><PB N="450" ID="pb.450"/>

with ffrolle the Duke of Almayne, and Randolf the Senescall
of Gaule, and hadde hem alle discounfited, and chaced oute
of the feelde, and restored the two brethern to theire londes;
and how he sholde take to wif the doughter of the kynge
leodogan of Carmelide, and how he hadde discounfited the kynge
Rion be-fore the Cite of Danablaise, and how he was gon in to
Carmelide for to spouse his wif.  Of these thinges spake the
princes prively to hir counseile, and seide that thei dide grete
synne euer hym for to wrath, ffor alle these harmes   <MILESTONE N="159b" UNIT="folio"/>that to
hem was fallen was but for the synne that thei hadde don
a-geins hym, and thei dide repente sore of the hate that was
be-twene hem, yef thei myght other-wise haue don; and preiden
god hertely that thei myght come in soche poynte that thei
were acorded, be so that thei ther-by be not shamed; and so
ran the tydinges of the kynge Arthur, that the kynge loot it
herde, and wiste how that his wif was at logres, and his litill
sone Mordred, and therfore in oon manere he was gladde and
in a-nother he was wroth; gladde for that she was delyuered
oute of the handes of the saisnes, and angry for that his
children hadde sworn that neuer sholde he haue hir in
companye of hym, ne haue theire love till that he hadde made
homage to kynge Arthur; but he saugh not how he myght
with hym be acorded with his honour, but yef god wolde helpe
hym of counseile, and than he be-thought hym how Arthur
wolde sende his wif to logres Chief Citee, and as soone as he
myght knowe of hir comynge he wolde gon hir a-geins with
as moche peple as he myght haue and fight with hym, and
assay to take Arthurs wif, and for hir myght he haue a-gein his.</P><P>  Thus thought the kynge loot, but other-wise sholde it go,
yef god kepe the force of kynge Arthur and of Sir
Gawein, his nevew.  Than the kynge loot sente his aspies fer and
nygh, for to knowe whan the kynge Arthur sholde come from
the reme of Carmelyde, and how moche peple that he hadde
in his companye, and he hym appareiled for to ride hym
a-geins.  But of these thynges cesseth the tale at thys tyme, and speketh
of Merlin, that was with Blaase in Northumbirlande, that alle


<EPB/><PB N="451" ID="pb.451"/>

these thinges hath hym tolde, and he hath hem alle in his
booke wreten; and the storye seith that as soone as the kynge
Arthur hadde seide to the kynge leodogan that he a-boode
nothinge elles but the comynge of Merlin, a-noon Merlin it
wiste, and alle the wordes that were ther seide, and that he
wiste the purpos of the xij kynges, and of the kynge loot, and
how he hadde sente his aspies, and alle he tolde to Blase, and
he wrote euer as he tolde; and Merlin com to Toraise in
Carmelide, where-as the Barons hym a-bode, and that was the
euen be-fore that the kynge sholde spousen his wif, and as
soone as the Barouns hym saugh, thei were of hym right gladde
and ioyfull, as thei that moche desired his feliship.  But now
we moste a litill turne for to speke of Gonnore the stepdoughter
of Cleodalis, the senescall of Carmelide, and of his kynnysmen
that right moche hated the kynge leodogan.</P><P>  Here seith the book that Gonnore, the doughter of the
senescallis wif, hadde right riche kynne of goode
knyghtes that sore hated the kynge leodogan, for the grete
  <MILESTONE N="160a" UNIT="folio"/>shame that he dide to Cleodalis of his wif, that he so longe hadde
holden in a-vouterie maugre Cleodalis, and alle his frendes, and
longe hadde thei kept prevy the hate that thei durste not
ther-of speke; but thei thought well to be wroken whan thei
saugh tyme, and it fill the same day that Merlin was come
thei were assembled of hem xvj, and spake to-geder, but at
this parlement was not Cleodalis, ne ther-of knewe no worde;
and oon of hem asked in what manere thei myght beste greve
or wrathe the kynge leodogan, and theire counseile was this:
ffor thei a-corded in the ende that thei sholde so speke to the
maistresse of Gonnore, that was Arthurs wif, that whan she
sholde be brought to bedde to the kynge Arthur, hir lorde,
this olde maistresse sholde brynge hir down in to the gardin
to disport, and ther while thei sholde sette ther the tother
Gonnore, their cosin, in stede of hir that was Arthurs wif; and
hir thei sholde sette in soche place that neuer man sholde
here-after more of hir speke, ne no man sholde wite where she
were be-come; and a-noon lete vs go and do so moche to the

maistresse that thus it may be don, and whan we haue brought
this a-boute, we shull be lordes bothe of the kinge and quene,
and of alle hem that be with the kynge.</P><P>  Than thei ordeyned that vij of hem sholde do this thefte,
and stele hir a-wey be the gardin, where-as thei sholde
be hidde, and haue ther shippe redy to putte hir ynne.  To
this counseile thei were a-corded, and thei dide so purchese
a-gein the maistresse, that she graunted hir will to performe;
and thei departed than gladde and mery as thei that wende
well to haue spedde, and ordeyned the shippe and all that was
myster; but a-noon as thei hadde this treson spoken Merlin
it wiste, and tolde it to Vlfin and to Bretell, and toke hem
a-side in counseile a-lone by hem-self, and tolde hem worde
for worde all the vntrouthe that thei purposed to don; and
whan Vlfin and Bretell herde the treson that these wolde haue
don, thei hadde ther-of grete merveile, and than thei preied
Merlin to telle how thei sholde spede of this thinge.  "With
gode will," seide Merlin.  "To morowe, at even, whan ye
haue souped, arme yow well vndir youre robes, and goth in
to the chamber next the gardin vnder the greces that is ther,
ffor thei shull come alle vn-armed saf hir swerdes, and shull
come thourgh the gardin streight to the wiket, where-as ther
shull bide till that the maistresse bringe hir to disporte.  But
loke a-noon as thei haue hir sesed that ye be no feynte her to
rescowe, ffor than a-noon haue ye her loste for euer yef thei
may bring hir to the shippe."  "Sir," seide these two goode
men, "yef god will, we shull not her lese, seth we knowe so
moche ther-of."  "And loke also," qoud Merlin, "that ye
speke here-of no worde to no man of nothinge that I haue to

and whan Gawein vndirstode that his frendes were ouer-sette,
he a-roos vp and asked his armes and horse, and his shelde,
and a-noon it was brought, and so dide alle his felowes, and
Gawein dide on an habergon of double maile vnder his robes
for that was euer more his custome euer as longe as he

for he douted euer that debate sholde a-rise amonge his felowes

the knyghtes of the rounde table ledde hem at her volunte, and
whan that Gawein saugh that thei were so at the werse he was

ffor thei diden so well, that the knyghtes of the rounde table
ther-of hadde envye; ffor dere sholde be bought the same

Gawein was called lorde and maister for the wele doinge that

was a wise knyght, and with-oute pride, and the moste curteise
that was in the bloy Breteyne, and the beste taught in alle

sir Gawein and sir Ewein le   <MILESTONE N="161b" UNIT="folio"/>graunt, the sone of kynge Vrien,

Gaheries; and the next tweyne were Seigramour and Galashyn,

smote be-twene hem two and hem departed, and cleped the

Thanne a-noon thei graunted <CORR SIC="to holde to holde">to holde</CORR>   the couenauntes, and
than thei sente after theire armes in the town; and as soone
as thei were brought thei hem armed spedily in alle haste, and
the tidinges therof com in to the barouns in what maner that
sir Gawein hadde take the turnement a-gein the knyghtes of the
rounde table; and thei preised hym gretely, bothe oon and

ther was neuer seyn soche a knyght of his age, and yef he
lyve longe he shall be the beste knyght that euer was, "and that
I hadde levest to resemble."  Thus spake the kynge Bohors of
sir Gawein, and thei hem armed hastely and soone, and lepe
to horse, and hem renged and a-ray, and eche roode a-gein

Adragein le noir, his shelde a-boute his nekke, the spere in honde,
and vpon a blakke stede; and on that other side com hym
a-gein Dodinell le sauage, as faste as horse myght renne, and
smote vpon the sheldes with sharpe grounde speres so rudely
that thei perced the sheldes thourgh the myght of theire armes,
and theire horse that swyftly hem bare, that he heedes stynted
at the hauberkes; but thei were so stronge   <MILESTONE N="162a" UNIT="folio"/>that thei faused
no mayle that the speres moste nede breke at the passinge

the horse swyfte, and thei hurteled so to-geder with sheldes

and as soone as thei were bothe ouerthrowen, thei ronne to

Gawein smote hym a-gein so rudely, that he bar hym from his
horse and his legges vp-right; but a-noon he lepte on foote,
for he was full bolde and hardy, and drough his swerde and
couered hym with his shelde, and apparailed hym redy for to

com to Nascien, and a-light on foote; and whan Nascien saugh
hym come with swerde drawen, he ne douted hym but litill,
for he was a full noble knyght, and hardy, and right sure, and
smote Gawein vpon the penon of the shelde that he clef it to

vpon the palme of his handes, but soone was he risen vp a-gein
and smote Gawein so grete a stroke vpon the helme that the
sparkeles fly oute flamynge reade; and whan Gawein saugh
that it a-noyed hym sore, and than he hitte Nascien vpon the
helme that he made it cleve, and that Nascien fill vpon bothe
knees, but he was of high herte, and lepte vpon foote, and in
the a-risinge Gawein caught hym be the helme, and raced it
from his heede so harde, that his nose and his browes were
sore hurte, and caste it as fer as he myght in to the presse, and
than he cried, "sir knyght yelde the, for thow seest well how
it is," and he ansuerde that he was not yet come ther-to for to
yelde hym, for no man that he saugh.  Than he couered hym
with his shelde, and smote Gawein so harde on the shelde,
that a grete pece fill on the grene, and Gawein lepte to hym
and smote hym so with the pomell of his swerde on the temple,

I may lyve."  Whan Gawein herde this, he saugh that he was
of right high herte, and he be-thought hym on a fraunchise
that many oon wolde haue be full loth to haue do, and a-noon
he toke hym vp by the armes and seide, "Sir knyght, haue
here my swerde, and I yelde me to yow as he that is outrayed;"
and whan Nascien saugh the grete gentilnesse that was in hym,
he was right gladde and seide, "Ha, sir, I crye yow mercy,
ne sey not so, but holde here my swerde that I yow here yelde,

ne may I yow quyte ne deserue, and than thei enbraced in

and hadde avented hym-self, he saugh how his felowes blenched

But Gawein dide moche harme with the sparre that was so
harde, and thei hem diffended full vigerously, that in no wise
wolde not voide the grounde; and whan Gawein saugh that
thei mayntened hem so well he smote a-monge hem Irous as

and than be-gan to do the werste that he myght hem to harmen
at his power.  Than Merlin and the thre kynges com hem to
disseuer, and than fill that Gawein mette Meodalis that hadde
smyte hym with a spere in the breste, that ner he hadde smyte
down bothe hym and his horse on an hepe; and he was full
wroth for the buffet that he hadde resceyved, and lifte up the
barre to smyte hym on the helme; and he saugh the stroke
come and blenched to eschewe the barre, but the stroke fill
be-twene the sholdres and smote hym down to the erthe; and
the kynge Arthur, that wele hadde seyn the stroke, cried pees,
that wele was vndirstonde of may oon, and cried a-lowde, "Feire
nevew, ley down the barre, for ye haue don right I-nowgh;"
and Merlin caught hym be that oon hande, and in that other
hande toke the barre, and seide, smylinge, "Sir knyght, thow
art take yelde thow to me, for ye haue don I-nough."</P><P>  Than Gawein be-helde and saugh it was Merlin; than he
seide full debonerly, "I am take seth that it yow
pleseth, and ther-with he lete falle the barre, and than he
asked why he dide hym take."  With that worde com the
kynge Arthur, and seide, "Gawein, feire nevewe, lefe the
turnement, for ye haue don I-nowgh; ffor we se well that it is to be
lefte."  And he ansuerde a-gein that so be it seth that he dide
 comaunde, and than tho v wente forth, and a-noon as Gawein
was oute thei departed and wente to theire hosteles for to
vn-arme hem.  But full sory were the knyghtes of the rounde

thei wolde so be a-venged that thei sholde not hem scorne ne

knyght com he tolde as the knyghtes of the rounde table hadde
seide, and Gawein vndirstode her manaces, and hir pride, and
he hadde ther-of grete dispite; but he made ther-of no semblance,
saf that he seide to his companye, that neuer he wolde hem
faile in no turnement ne in werre.  These wordes seide Gawein
to his felowes, and he hilde it wele, ffor it was well shewed
after who was the beste knyght that day that thei toke
turnement at logres in the medowes, as shall be reherseth whan
tyme cometh; as soone as the turnement was departed, and
the kynge and his nevew were in the paleise, the knyghtes of
the rounde table wente to vn-arme hem at her ostels, and the
mene peple of the town conveied I-nowgh sir Gawein, and seide
oon to a-nother, lo here the goode knyght, and thei gadered
a-boute hym on alle partes, and conveyed him to the paleise,
and in to the halle, and thei asked oon of a-nother what he was;
and Merlin hem ansuerde, and seide his name was Gawein,
the nevew of kynge Arthur, and the sone of kynge loot of
Orcanye; and whan thei herden what he was, thei seiden as
gladde peple that he shewed well fro whens he was comen,
thus the peple of the town seiden her volunte, and than thei
returned; and whan the knyghtes of the rounde table were
vn-armed, thei clothed hem and a-raide hem in her beste robes,
and com to court; and where thei saugh sir Gawein, thei
drough a-boute hym and compleyned to hym of hym-self, and
seide that he hadde hem euyll be seyn at that firste turnement,
and that fro thens-forth he ought wele to be lorde and maister,
and felowe of the rounde table; and Gawein hem herde wele,
but he ansuerde hem no worde, and fro thens-forth he was a
lorde and maister, and a felowe of the rounde table; and it was
goode reson, ffor he was a noble knyght, and a trewe and full

Gonnore be-lefte in the Chamber, she and hir maistresse alone,
and that day was purchesed the   <MILESTONE N="164b" UNIT="folio"/>treson wherby she sholde
be taken and traied of the parentes of Gonnore, the stepdoughter

vnder her robes, and weren quat vnder the steyres ther as the

and the gardin was right high a-bove the river, and noon myght
come ther-to but by a lane or by a barge, and the lane was
full thikke and comberouse to come vp or down for the rokkes,
wherof was grete plente; and yef thei myght haue brought hir

Bretell smote so the firste that he mette that he slytte hym

dismayed.  Than thei toke the false Gonnore and ledde hir to
theire hostell, for thei wolde that noon aparceyved her covyne.</P><P>  Thus as ye haue herde were the traitours demened by the
counseile of Merlin, and the Queene was socoured by
these two worthi men; and as soone as thei were gon, a-noon
Merlin it knewe well, and than he badde the kynge sende two
maydenes in to the chamber to the queene for to bringe hir to
bedde, and the kynge asked wherefore is ther not I-nowgh of
the maistresse, and Merlin tolde hym the trouthe all as it was
be-fallen; and whan the kynge it herde he merveiled moche
of this thinge, and seide he sholde not be in ese till he hadde
spoken with his doughter; and than departed the kynge leodogan
and com in to the chamber where-as Gonnore his doughter
was, and brought with hym two maydenes to helpe hir to
bedde; and whan she saugh hir fader she be-gan tenderly to
wepe, and the kynge toke hir by the hande, and spake with
hir sooll by hir-self, and he badde hir not to be dismayed, for
she sholde no more haue no drede, and she tolde hym all the
auenture that was be-fallen; and than the kynge comaunded
the maydenes to make hir redy, and bringe hir to bedde, and
thei a-noon dide his comaundement,   <MILESTONE N="165b" UNIT="folio"/>and the kynge leodogan
wolde neuer departe oute of the chambre till that he saugh
the signe of the crowne vpon hire reynes; and than wiste he
verily that it was his doughter vpon his wif, and than he
couered hir a-gein, a wente oute of the chambre and spake no

so, and than com the kynge Arthur and his companye from
theire disporte, and whan he com in to the halle, the kynge
Leodogan and Merlin com hym a-geins, and badde hym go to
his wif to bedde, ffor it was reson and high tyme, and he
seide he wolde with good will, and com in to the chambre
where the two maidenes weren that hadde brought the queene
to bedde, and as soone as he was in his bedde thei departed
oute of the chambre, and lefte no moo but hem two, and ther
thei ledde myri lif togeder as thei that well loued.</P><P>  Thus sholde the queene haue be disceyued be these traitours,
and thourgh hem after-ward hadde she grete annoye that
longe tyme endured, as the storye shall declare how that the
kynge hir lefte thre yer, that she com neuer in his companye;
but was with Galehaut, a riche prince in the reame of Sorloys,
for the love of launcelot; and the kynge Arthur hilde in
a-voutrye the false Gonnore till that a maladie hir toke, and
Bertelak, a traitour, that made he wolde hir not forsake for
no man, till that she stanke and rotened a-bove erthe, and the
reame was therfore nygh thre yere enderdited, and stode a-cursed
that neuer manes body ne womans was byried in noon halowed
place, but a-cursed be the centense of holy cherche, and all
this trouble suffred oure lorde hem for to haue for his synnes
that were right grete, and all this com thourgh a knyght that
died after vpon myschevouse deth, as ye shull here declared
in the seconde book of this storie, and it is reson to telle what
was the cause that it fill.</P><P>  This was the trouthe that the kynge leodogan was a noble
knyght, and kepte well Iustice and right, and he
hadde with hym a wise knyght that hadde don hym goode
servise; and he was come of high lynage, and hadde be a
goode knyght in his tyme, and was cleped Bertelak, and he
hated a knyght dedly, for that he hadde slayn his cosin germain
for his wif, that he loved, and whan Bertelak wiste that he
hadde his cosin slain, and his wif diffouled, he ne deyned not
to make no playnt to the kynge leodogan, but com to hym and
hym diffied, and a-waited hym after many a day and many

a nyght; and it fill that same even that arthur hadde wedded
his wif that the knyghtes departeden for the court, and wente
to theire hostels, and happed that Bertelak mette that knyght
and with hym two squyers, and a-noon Bertelak ran vpon hym
and hym slowgh; and whan he hadde don he wente to his
hostell, and the two squyers that were with the knyght made
a grete crie, that   <MILESTONE N="166a" UNIT="folio"/>the peple ronne oute on alle parties with
lanternes, and brondes of fire, and torches brennynge, and fonde
the knyght slayn, and thei aske the two squyers that made so
grete doell who hadde hym slain; and thei seide that Bertelak
the rede hadde it don, and whan the squyers hadde cried and
braied for theire lord longe while, thei toke hym vp and bar
hym to theire hostell, and dide hym birie as oon sholde do
a deed knyght, and dide the seruise at cherche as ther-to
belonged; and on the morowe Vlfin and Bretell sente after
Cleodalis, the stiward, for to come speke with hem in her hostell,
and he com a-noon with goode chere as fre and debonair, and
a-noon as he was comen, thei toke hym in counseile, and tolde
hym all the a-uenture as it was be-fallen how his doughter
hadde wrought; and whan he hadde herde the vntrouthe of
hire he seide his doughter was she not, ffor yef she hadde be
my doughter she hadde not don this for no-thinge that is in
the erthe; and as thei spake to-geder a-monge hem thre.  The
kynge leodogan was a-risen erly, ffor sore was he affraied of
the merveiles that were be-falle that nyght of his doughter,
and Merlin was also a-risen, and seide, "Sir, god yeve yow
goode morowe;" and whan the kynge hym saugh he made
hym feire chere, and bad god hym blisse.  Than eche toke other
be the hande, and wente spekynge of many thinges till thei
com to the hostell of Vlfin and Bretell, and thei entred in so
stilliche that thei ther-of wiste no worde till thei were euen
comen vpon hem, and a-noon as thei were of hem war, thei
yede hem a-geins as thei that nothinge were a-baisshed to
worship eny worthi man.  Than thei entred in to a chambre alle
v, and Vlfin brought forth Gonnore, and tolde how she and
the traitours hadde wrought, not-with-stondinge thei knewe it


<EPB/><PB N="468" ID="pb.468"/>

alle wele, for Merlin hadde it tolde the kynge all as it
was.  Than spake the kinge leodogan to his stiwarde, and seide,
"Sir, Senescall, I love yow well, and fayn I wolde purchace
youre worshippe for to encrece, and so I shall do yef I may lyve;
ffor full well ye haue me serued and trewly, and therfore
wolde I do nothinge that sholde yow turne to shame or reprof,
and witte ye wherfore I it sey.  Se here youre doughter that
wele hath deserued that ther sholde be don on hir
Iustice.  But ye haue be so trewe to me that I ought it wele to pardon
for the love of yow, or a gretter thinge than is this.  But for
that me be-hoveth for to take vengaunce in some manere, hit
be-houeth yow to bringe hir oute of this reame In soche wise
that neuer she be sein of man ne of woman that hir knowe;
ffor so I will that it be don;" and the stiwarde ansuerde and
seide that his doughter ne was she neuer.  But in as moche as
it was his wille and his <MILESTONE N="166b" UNIT="folio"/>comaundement he wolde hit don, "ffor
so god helpe me," quod he, "I hadde leuer she hadde be biried
all quyk than this hadde hir be-fallen.  Ne to me she ne
aperteyned nothinge neuer."  "Now," quod the kynge, "lete
be all this matier, and loke that it be don in soche maner that
I neuer here more speche of hir here-after, and that ye take
of myne what that is youre plesier."</P><P>  Thus was take the counseile of the Barouns, and Cleodalis
appareiled hym and his stepdoughter to go with-outen
lenger respite, and rode forth by theire iourneyes till thei com
oute of the reame of Carmelide in to an abbey that stode in a
full wilde place, and ther he hir lefte, as seith the storie, till
that Bertelak the reade hir fonde, whiche by his art and his
engyn by hir lay longe tyme after.  But of hir as now speketh
no more the tale saf that Cleodalis lefte hir there, and come
a-gein to Toraise in to the grete Court of the kynge leodogan

was the kynge Ban of Benoyk, and the kynge Bohors of Gannes
that was his brother, and the beste knyght that eny man neded
to seche, and so ther were CCL knyghtes of the rounde table that
alle were feed men with the kynge leodogan, and the queene
hadde so praied sir Amnistian that was chapelein with the kynge
leodogan hir fader, that he com with hir, and was sithen hir
chapelein longe tyme; and so ledde Gonnore hir cosin that was
feire, and debonaire, and amyable to alle peple, and Sadoyne
hir brother that was elther than she, and Castelein of
Daneblaise, the noble Citee; and as soone as the kynge Arthur

hadde knowinge by his asspies, and he and his knyghtes rode
a-gein hym, and hem enbusshed in the foreste of sapernye, and
seide that ther sholde he a-bide the kynge Arthur, and take

and Blaase hem wrote as he tolde, and by his booke haue we

  </P><P>Whan the kynge Arthur was departed from the kynge
leodogan, and Merlin also, as ye haue herde, he rode

that sore desired the assemble, as he that was hardy and
enterpendaunt, and right sure ne hadde ben oon tecche that he

custome borde of the sothe hym hated many a knyght for the
shame that thei hadde of his wordes, and therfore he myshapped

he euer a-gein his lorde, and a-gein the queene, euer in to the
ende of his deth.  Ne neuer in all his live dide he treson saf

be-fore vpon the blakke stede that gripeth the grete spere vnder
the shelde of goolde and azur ther-ynne, a lyon rampaunt;"
and the kynge Ban be-heilde, and seide, "Who is it?  telle

that newliche was sette on horse, and heilde a stronge spere,
and com a-gein hym as moche as the horse myght renne, and
mette to-geder vpon the sheldes with all theire forces, and the
kynge brake his spere vpon Gaweins shelde, and Gawein smote
hym a-gein so harde that he perced shelde and hauberke, and
wounded hym somwhat in the lifte side that the blode folowed
after, and the kynge fill so harde to grounde that he wiste not
wheder it was day or nyght; and Gawein paste forth rudely
with-oute a-restinge, and whan he was returned a-gein he
fonde his fader lyinge on the erthe vp-right, and he rode ouer
hym on horsebak thre or foure tymes, and broused hym sore
and foule that nygh he was ther-with slayn; and than Gawein
a-light and pight his spere in the grounde, and drough oute
Calibourne his goode swerde, that shone bright and clier, and
com to the kynge loot that yet lay vp-right and plukked hym
by the helme, and raced it of his heede so harde, that on his
nose and his browes it was well seene, for he was hurte right
sore; and than he a-valed the coyf of his hauberke be-nethe his
shuldres, and seide that he was but deed, but yef he wolde
yelde hym to prison, and he was so anguysshous that litill he
hym ansuerde, neuertheles he dide hym-self enforce, so that he
seide with grete sorowe at his herte, "Ha, sir, gentilman, ne
sle me nought, for neuer dide I forfet a-gein the, where-fore that
thow sholdest me sleen."  "Yesse," quod Gawein, "that haste

Orcanye, and of leonoys, to whom nothinge doth falle but
myschef ne not hath don longe tyme.  Now telle me youre

it was his fader a-noon he nempned his name, and seide his
name was Gawein, the nevew of kynge Arthur, and whan the
kynge loot herde that a-noon he lepte vp, and wolde haue clypt
hym in his armes, and seide, "Feire sone, ye be welcome, and
I am the sorowfull caitif youre fader that ye haue thus viliche

ffor his fader sholde he not be ne his goode frende till that he
were a-corded with the kynge his vncle, and hadde cried hym
mercy for his forfet, and than do to hym homage seynge alle

shull ye leve noon other wedde saf youre heed, and than the
kynge looth sowowned and fill down to the grounde, and whan
he a-woke of swownynge he cride him mercy, and seide, "Feire

hadde grete pite hit toke with gladde chere and myri, and wepte
right tendirly water with his iyen vndir his helme, ffor sore he
repente in his herte of that he hadde so hurte his fader, but as

com be-fore Arthur and sette hym on his knee, and hielde his
swerde be the poynte as he that hadde forfeted, and seide, "Sir,
I yelde me here to youre mercy as he that hath often a-gein

he hym comaunded; than Arthur toke hym be the right hande
and made hym to a-rise on his feet, and seide, "Sir, stondeth

holde court open and enforced, and sente by his messangers
that alle sholde come to his court roiall; and on the morowe the
kynge Loot dide his homage to the kynge Arthur, and made

and some ther were of hem that thoughten in theire hertis and

that the kynge hadde I-made, thei spake to-geder and seiden,
"Seeth that the kynge hath made a-vow in his courte, hit
be-hoveth that we make oure a-vow," and thei a-corded alle to

Nascien, "the knyghtes of the rounde table be come here to

whan the kynge this vndirstode, he asked of the knyghtes of

whan Gawein vndirstode the ioye that thei maden for the

the kynge was glader than eny other that was in the courte,
and for the kynge wolde comforte the queene, he seide, "Dame,
seth god hath ordeyned yow this honour to haue so feire a

also for the love of youre-self, and wite ye wher-of I putte in
youre gouernaunce my tresour in soch maner that ye be lady
and partyner of all youre plesier;" and whan the queene
this herde, she kneled be-fore the kynge and seide, "Sir,
gramercy."  And than the queene called sir Gawein, and seide,
"Feire   <MILESTONE N="172a" UNIT="folio"/>nevew, I will that foure clerkes be stablisshed
hereynne that shull do nothinge elles but write the a-ventures that
falle to yow and youre felowes, so that after youre deth it
may be remembred the high prowesse of the worthi men
hereynne."  "Madame," seide Gawein, "I graunte;" and than
were ther chosen foure clerkes to write the a-ventures as thei
fill in the courte fro thens-forth; and than seide Gawein that
he sholde not here speke of noon a-venture, but he sholde go to
seche it; and he and his felowes sholde do so moche that thei
sholde bringe ther-of trewe tidinges to courte, and so seiden the
knyghtes of the rounde table in the same manere; and all-wey
fro thens-fourth was sir Gawein and his felowes called the
queenes knyghtes.  With that were the clothes taken vp, and
than be-gan the ioye right grete of oon and other ther-ynne,
But ouer alle other that were ther-ynne was I-herde Dagenet
of Clarion; ffor he made gret myrthe amonge hem, so that alle
thei be-hielde hym for merveile.  But a fooll he was of nature,
and the moste coward pece of flessh that was in the worlde;


<EPB/><PB N="484" ID="pb.484"/>

this Dagenet be-gan to trippe and daunce, and cried so lowde
with high voyse, and seide, "to-morow shall I go seche these
a-ventures," and seide to Gawein, "will ye come? and ye, sir
Ewein and Segramor will ye come thider that be so feire
and moche, and ye lordinges of the rounde table.  Certes, I
trowe not that ye haue the herte ne the hardynesse me for to
sewen, ther I shall go to-morowe."  Thus seide Dagenet the
coward, and the knyghtes ther-at lowen, and hadde grete game;
and with-oute faile he hym armed many tymes, and wente in
to the forestes, and henge his shelde on an Oke, and smote it so
that alle the colours were faded, and the shelde to hakked in
many places, and than wolde he seyn that he hadde slayn a
knyght or tweyne; and whan he mette eny knyght armed he
turned to flight as fer as he myght here hym speke at the leeste;
and many tymes fill yef he mette eny knyght erraunt that
were pensif that spake no worde he wolde take hym by the
bridell, and lede hym forth as he hadde hym taken; of soche
maners was Dagenet, and yet he was right a feire knyght and
of high lynage, and yet it semed not by his countenaunce that
he was soche a fooll.</P><P>  Grete was the ioye and the feeste the day of myddill of
August, at logres, whan these a-vowes were made, and
whan thei that hadden serued hadde eten, com kay the stiwarde,
and seide, "Sirs, what thenke ye to do; shull we not tourney
to be-gynne some myrthe at soche high feeste as this is?"  Whan
Segramor herde this he lepte vp, and seide that recreaunt and
shamed be he that will not turneyn; and Mynoras ansuerde
that thei wolde turney a-gein the queenes knyghtes, "and lete
vs take so many knyghtes what oon and what other that we
be euen like many,"   <MILESTONE N="172b" UNIT="folio"/>and sir Gawein asked a-gein how many
knyghtes thei wolde turney, and Adragain seide thei wolde
haue V<HI1 REND="sup">c</HI1> in her companye, and Gawein seide that he wolde
take other V<HI1 REND="sup">c</HI1> in his companye.  "Than lete it no lenger be
taried," quod Pynados, "for the day passeth."  Than thei wente
to theire hostels and armed hem with grete spede, and yede
in to the medowes with-oute the town, and ther thei assembled

what oon what other that thei were x<HI1 REND="sup">c</HI1>.  Than was the ban
cried that eche man sholde go on whiche part that he wolde,
and thei disseuered and wente eche to his baner; and than com
Gawein to hervy de rivell, and departed theire meyne, so that
in eche partye ther was v hundred, and than the heraudes
be-gan for to crye, <FOREIGN>Cy est lonours darmes Ore y parra qui checun

sir Gawein, and seide, "The kynge yowre vncle sente yow
worde that ye sholde come speke with hym at the wyndowe
ther-as he yow a-bideth;" and sir Gawein wente thider and
ledde with hym sir Ewein his cosyn, and Segramour, and
Gyfflet, and the curroyes were tho redy assembled for to mete.</P><P>  The first that was renged was Pynodas, a knyght of the
rounde table, and on that othir side com a knyght of
the queenes that was brother to Gawein, and his name was
Agravain the prowde, and he was wondir well horsed, and thei
smote to-geder with speres vpon the sheldes so harde that thei
perced that the steill heedes stynted at the hauberkes, and thei
were bothe stronge and hardy, and the hauberkes of towgh
mayle that the speres splyndred in peces, and in the passinge
forth thei hurteled to-geder so harde with sheldes and helmes,
and with theire horse, that bothe two fill to grounde, horse
and man to-geder; and thei pressed to the rescew on bothe
partyes and mette to-geder with sharpe speres; and sir Gawein
hath so riden till he com on the diche brynke a-gein the
wyndowe ther-as kynge Arthur dide lene, and the Queene
Gonnore, and the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and ladyes
and maydenes, a grete companye for to be-holde the bourdeys;

but I may not kepe hem alle from theire folyes.  But yef ye

seith wisely; ffor it is goode reson that ye take a party of youre
peple, and do hem to be armed as many as nedeth that yef
myster be, thei to be redy to lepe on horsebak to do youre
comaundement."  "In godis name," seide the kynge, "so shall
it be as ye haue seide."  Than the kynge comaunded to arme
thre thousande what of Sergauntes and squyers, and hym-self
was armed, and the thre other kynges that were in his
  <MILESTONE N="173a" UNIT="folio"/>companye; and Gawein was come to the turney, that tho was well
be-gonne vpon the two knyghtes that were throwe to grounde,
and so hadde bothe parties spedde that thei haue hem bothe
remounted and sette on horse; and than the turnement be-gan
sore to enforce, and the knyghtes of the rounde table that were
CCL peyned hem sore to discounfite the foure score felowes of
sir Gawein that were at grete myschief, and hadde sore the
werse, but moche thei suffred as thei that full well eche dide
other helpe feithfully.  But their well doynge ne gayned hem
but litill, ne hadde be the knyghtes of kynge Looth that hem
socoured full vigerously.  Ther was made many feire Iustinges
and many a knyght vn-horsed that fill to the grounde, and the
horses fledde thourgh the feeldes.  Ther were the knyghtes
of the rounde table euell I-ledde, but as vij score knyghtes that
com hem for to socoure, and than hadde the knyghtes of the
rounde table the better, ffor thei were more peple than the
tother, and thei made hem to voyde the place wheder thei

hem that fledden.</P><P>  And whan Gawein vndirstode the shoute and the crye
that was vpon his felowes, he be-helde and saugh hem
at grete myscheif, and that for thought hym right sore, and
seide to sir Ewein, "A-voy, cosin, we haue taried to

partriches or quayles, and bar to the erthe foure the firste that

that the chace stynte, and in a while were thei knowen of hem
that neuer hadde hem seyn; and whan the Queenes knyghtes
hadde founde sir Gawein thei drough a-boute hym, and so dide
the knyghtes of kynge looth that were full notable knyghtes

thei that weren at the wyndowes marked hym with the fynger,
and seide, "Lo yonder, Sir Segramor, ffor yef he be feire of

Gawein that were full noble and hardy.  These dide
merveilously wele, and so dide Sir Ewein, that a better knyght than

they dide wondres in armes.  But who that dide well, or who
nought, a-bove alle other   <MILESTONE N="173b" UNIT="folio"/>dide sir Gawein merveiles, ffor he
fonde no presse were it neuer so thikke ne cloos, but he it
perced through be fin force, ffor he smote down knyghtes and

fonde sir Gawein on foote, and his suerde in his honde all

Gawein remounted and sette on horse, and he putte vp his
goode swerde and toke the staf with bothe hondes, and ran vpon
hem crewelly, and smote he rought not where, and discounfited
hem alle in short tyme, and put hem to flight thourgh the yates

be-holden of ladyes and maydenes that were on the walles of

were goode knyghtes on bothe sides.  But at the end myght not
the knyghtes endure that were on Gaweins side, for thei were
not so many as the tother, and so thei be-gonne to ruse oon hour

come thider thei be-gonne to do so well that in all the day ne
hadde thei do better, and so thourgh hir prowesses thei perced
hem thourgh thre or foure tymes, and hem discounfited and
made hem voide the place, and drof hem in at the yates of the

ne with-holde thei were so wroth, for the outerage that the
knyghtes of the rounde table hadde be-gonne vpon hem
vncurteisly thourgh her pride.</P><P>  On that other side was Gawein and the knyghtes of Orcanye,
that hadde chaced so the <CORR SIC="knythes">knyghtes</CORR>   of the rounde table
till thei com be-fore the chirche of seint Stephene, and thei
with-stode and kepte the paas while thei myght.  But in short
tyme ther sholde haue ben do harme.  But as the kynge
Arthur com, and the kynge Ban and the Kynge Bohors com
thider as sone as Galescowde hadde tolde his message; and the
squyers that were thre thousande armed, and the thre kynges
turned toward seint Stephene, and a party of the squyers
a-boute a thre hundred turned down the high strete where-as
thei mette the knyghtes of Orcanye that sewed sir Gawein that
full euell ferde with the knyghtes of the rounde table, as ye
haue herde; and as soone   <MILESTONE N="176b" UNIT="folio"/>as thei saugh the squyers thei
wende it hadde ben a-wayte that hadde be leide for hem;
and a-noon thei be-gonne to medle and be-gonne a newe trouble
right huge and crewell, but at grete myschef were the felowes
of sir Gawein, ffor oo part of hem foughten with the squyers at
the straite entre of the strete, where-as many were ouerthrowen
and diffouled right euell.  Than com tidinges to Gawein that
his frendes were in soche pereill; "ffor I wote neuer," quod he
that brought the message, "what peple it ben that hem assaile
be-hynde, and don hem grete damage;" and as soone as Gawein
herde that his felowes were assaile be-hynde, he lefte the fight
with the knyghtes of the rounde table to his felowes, and com
thider ther as thise weren.  But first he sette goode wardes to
kepe the stretes ende, that thei of the rounde table ne turned not
a-gein bakke, and than he com to the strete ther these were
fightinge; and as soone as he hem saugh, he swor in euell tyme
come thei thider, and whan thei saugh hym come thei cried to
hym and badde hym cesse, or he was but deed; and whan
Gawein herde hem manace hym of deth, he wax right wroth,

and cleped hem "fitz a-putayn traitours cowardes haue ye leyn
in wayte.  I do yow to wite er ye me ascape, the moste hardy
wolde not haue come hider for this reame."  Than he hilde
Calibourne his goode swerde all blody, and these ronne vpon
hym with axes, and billes, and swerdes right vigerously; and
he spronge in a-monge hem, and smote the firste that he mette
that the heed fill on the pament, and than he smote a-nother,
and than the thridde and the fourthe, and smote of handes and
armes that in a litill while noon durste a-bide his strokes, but
turned to flight wroth and angry, and cried, "Fle, fle, lo here
a devell that is broken oute of helle chaynes;" and whan
Gawein hadde his felowes thus delyuered, he turned a-gein and
toke xl. knyghtes at sette hem at the stretes ende that noon ne
falle vpon hem, and seide, "Yef eny come and yow ouer-lede
come fecche me."  Than he wente to the tother ende of the
strete <CORR SIC="ther ther">ther</CORR>   the knyghtes of Orcanye faught with the knyghtes
of the rounde table, and a-noon he spronge in a-monge hem,
and cried a-lowde, "Traytours;" for well he wende that thei
hadde leide that a-wayte, and whan thei herde hym so seyn
thei wiste not what to ansuere, ffor thei wende well that he
hadde it seide for that thei be-gan firste the ernest whan thei
iusted with speres in fewtre, and sore thei repented yef thei
myght, ffor so hadde the shame be doubled, and therefore seith
the wise man in reprof of soche.  "Many oon weneth his shame
to a-venge, and he it encreseth," and therefore were thei
shame-fast and mate; and Gawein smote in a-monge hem crewell as a
lyon, and smote Adragain des vaux de gailore thourgh the
helme that he kutte the quoyf of maile to the bare flessh that he
fill to the erthe all a-stonyed that he wiste not whether it was
nyght or day, and than he smote Pindolus on the sholdre that

his felowes hem enchaced, and fill that Gawein overtoke hervy
de rivell, and wolde haue smyte hym on the helme, and he
couered hym with his shelde, and all thei turned to-geder
toward the mynster, and hervy seide to Gawein, "Cesse, sir

at this tyme, and trewly ye be right moche to blame for the
crewelte that is in yow, ffor men were wonte to sey of yow all
honour and curtesie, and now may men sey the contrarie, ffor
ye ought to helpe and to socoure these a-gein all the worlde that
hem wolde greve or annoye, and ye hem sle and diffoule at
youre power; and thei haue yow nought offended."  "Hervy,"
quod Gawein, "haue thei me not offended whan thei haue
be-gonne the foly and the treson vpon my felowes to whom
I moste bere feith, and ther-by wolde thei not cesse, but leide
other peple for vs in a-wayte, and the turnement was not taken
in that manere."  "Sir," seide hervy, "yef thei haue hem
mystaken a-gein yow at this tyme, thei shull a-mende it to yow
at youre plesir, ffor the love of yow that from hens-forth thei
will holde yow for theire frende and felowe."  "To me," quod
Gawein, "shull thei make noon a-mendes, for I shall hem neuer
love, ffor I do hem well to wite where thei haue envye or werre
a-gein eny of my felowes thei haue the same a-gein me.  Ne

vndertake, and lete hem well knowe that I shall neuer come in

turnement or Aatine, yef eny of hem be there, but I shall greve
hem at my power."  "Sir," seide hervy, "ye sey euell and
synfulliche, but soche is now youre talente; but here-after it
shall not be so; ffor it were to grete damage yef so many worthi
men sholde turne to euell for this folye, ffor rather thei shull
clene forsake the court of youre vncle."  "I can not sey," quod
Gawein, "what thei will do, but for me shull thei it not

forsaken, and yef that thei do, thei ne shull not go in to no
londe, but thei shall be ouertake, ffor we shull neuer here speke
of place ther thei be conversaunt, but we shull go
thider."  "Sir," seide hervy, "a-slake youre mode and pese youre

the foly thei haue it dere I-bought, ffor many ther be hurt and
wounded full dolerously, ffor ther ben xxx that neuer shull bere
shelde, where-of is right grete doell and pyte, ffor thei ben full
noble knyghtes and worthi men;" and as thei spake thus com
the kynge Arthur that hadde I-herde a partie of her wordes that
thei hadde spoken, and seide,   <MILESTONE N="177b" UNIT="folio"/>"Gawein, feire nevew, is this
the prayer that I praied yow to-day?  Certes now it sheweth
well that ye love me right litill whan a-gein my diffence, and in
dispite of me as me semeth ye sle thus my peple, wite it well
that it is a thinge that hevieth me right sore."  "Sir," seide
Gawein, "he that be-gan the foly it is reson that he repent.  Ne
in dispite of yow haue I nothinge do, and who ther-of will me
accuse he is not vnder heuene, but I shall me well a-gein hym
diffende; ffor as soone as the foly be-gan to a-rise I sente yow

hadde thei vs sore diffouled, er that we wolde eny thinge do;"
and the kynge looth his fader com to hym and toke hym by the

meyne of the rounde table, and the thre kynges hym
dide bringe a-wey, and Galescowde com to the gret turnement
that was with-ynne the yates that was grete and
merveilouse.  But to foule were thei be-seyn be-twene segramor and sir Ewein,
and her other felowes; but Galescowde made hem be departed,
and that was with moche peyne and sore annoye; ffor thei were
sore chauffed that oon vpon that other, and than eche wente

theire visages with warm water, and clothed hem in her
fresshest robes, and wente to court alle tho that myghten, and
thei that were hurt and wounded a-bode at theire hostelles for
to hele theire woundes, and on that other parte wente Gawein
and his felowes hem for to vn-arme in oon of the Queenes
chambres that was assigned for hem to repeire; and whan thei
were vn-armed and waissh, thei clothed hem richely, and yef thei
were well serued it nedeth not to aske, ffor ther were ladyes
and maydenes hem for to serue grete foyson.  Ther was
Segramor moche be-holden of oon and of other, ffor he was
a feire knyght and semly, and so was also Dodinell le sauage;
these tweyne were sore preised of all that hem be-helden.</P><P>  As soone as thei were a-raied, thei com in to the halle two

Gawein and Ewein albefore in to the halle be-fore the kynge
that to hem made gret ioye; and whan he saugh hem come he
a-roos on his feet a-gein hem, and toke sir Gawein be the
right hande, and the queene toke hym by the tother hande
and wente to sitte alle to-geder, and the other knyghtes satte
thourgh the halle, and pleied and disported oon with a-nother of
dyuerse thinges, and were gladde and myry.  But a-bove alle
other was the quene ioyfull   <MILESTONE N="178a" UNIT="folio"/>of her knyghtes that hadde the
victorye of the turnement.  But the knyghtes of the rounde
table be nother gladde ne iocunde, but were shamefast and
mate for her felowes, that many were hurt and wounded, and
so thei spake of many thinges till thei acorded to send hervy de

Nascien, for tweyne better myght thei not take to performe the

whan these thre knyghtes saugh thei most do the message, thei
toke eche other by the hande and com be-fore the kynge; and whan
the kynge saugh hem comynge he a-roos a-gein hem as he that

thei were well-come, and also a-roos sir Gawein.  Than spake

Hervy to the kynge, and seide, "Sir, plese it yow to sitte,
ye and youre companye, and we shull telle yow wherfore we
beth come."  Than sat down the kynge and his companye, and
hervy be-gan his reson, "Sir, the companye of the rounde table
have sente vs to speke to sir Gawein, and to my lady the

a maner that alle matalent be pardoned on bothe partyes;" and
the kynge loked on the quene, and seide that sholde not be
refuced; and the quene ansuerde and seide that it plesed hir
wele, yef that sir Gawein ther-to a-corded, but he kept scilence,
and spake no worde.</P><P>  Whan the kynge saugh he stodied, he seide, "Gawein,
feire nevew, what <CORR SIC="thin">think</CORR> ye of this thinge that ye be
so wrorth and angry; ffor in this haue ye but honour, whan the
beste knyghtes of the worlde obbey hem to yow and offre to
a-mende all that is mysdon."  "Worthi men!" quod
Gawein.  "Ye feire nevew worthy men, and noble ben thei
trewly."  "Thei ought well to be so," quod Gawein, and with that he
hilde his pees; and the kynge that saugh well he was a-gein
hem Irous and angry, he loked on the quene, and seide, "Dame,
praye ye hym at this tyme;" and the quene seide, "Sir, with
gode will."  Than she toke hym be the hande, and seide,
"Nevew, be not so wroth, refroide youre maltalente, ffor
wrath hath many a worthi man and wise made to be holde for

and ye knowe well that this londe is in sorowe and turment of

shull ye not hem failen.  But, feire nevew, pardon hem for I
pray yow, and so doth the kynge youre vncle, that is right
wroth;" and sir Gawein loked on the quene and be-gan to
smyle for the wordes that she hadde seide, and seide, "Madame,
who that will lerne lete hym come to yow, and blissed be that
lorde that so yow hath ordeyned, and that the companye of so
goode a lady, and so wise hath vs graunted, and well may the

wisest lady of the worlde, and so be ye now as I beleve; and
wite ye what ye haue wonne, ye may do with my body and
myn herte all youre volunte, say myn honour and myn vncle the

wise that ther-of yow requered.  Ne, I ne shall neuer, yef god
will."  Thus a-peesed the quene sir Gawein, and so was the
pees grauntid, and than wente Nascien and Hervy de rivell for
to fecche theire felowes of the rounde table, and com be-fore the
kynge; and the quene dide clepe sir Ewein, and Segramor,
and the thre brethern of Gawein, and a party of other, and
tolde hem how the pees was made, and how it was required by
the companye of the rounde table; and sir Ewein seide it was
well don, and better it were to haue the love of hem than the
hate.</P><P>  With that were the knyghtes of the rounde table come
be-fore the kynge, and as soone as thei were come
thei kneled to sir Gawein, and folded the panes of her mantels;
and than spake hervy de rivell, "Sir, we shull a-mende to yow

yef it may not than eche man do his beste."  "Ffor-sothe,"
seide the kynge, "that wolde I fayn, yef I knewe who to

thei be full fierce and full of pride."  "Sir," seide the kynge
loot, "the saisnes haue hem so greved that I trowe whan thei

hit shall not nede gretly hem to prayen."  "I can not sey,"
quod Arthur, "what I sholde ther-of to yow sey, ffor as well
knowe ye the neethe of the londe as do I, and I am but a man
as oon of yow be, and therfore loke and cheseth soche a man
that may beste this message performe."  "Sir," seide the
kynge Ban, "yef I wiste the kynge looth wolde conne me no

the nodes than eny that ye sholde sende, and better he cowde
enforme hem of youre volunte, for he is with hem a-queynted

"and better he knoweth the passages than eny other that

I myght thider sende;" and the quene seide "that noon other
man sholde so well do the needes as the kynge looth, but yef
it be for the saisnes that all day gon robbinge thourgh the

foure sones.  "Trewly," seide the kynge Bohors, "yef thei
ben with yow than haue ye no drede of no man of moder
born."  Whan <CORR SIC=" ">King Arthur</CORR> saugh that thei were to this a-corded that the
kynge looth sholde lede with hym his foure sones, he yaf a grete
sigh, for he douted of sir Gawein, in whom he hadde so tentefly
sette his love, so that ther was nothinge in the worlde that he
loved so moche, and the quene knewe a partie of his thought, and
seide to the kynge, "Sir, graunte the kynge looth to lede with
hym his children hardely, for their shull haue no drede, yef god
will, ffor the more thei be youre frendes the better, and withe
the more tendir herte   <MILESTONE N="180b" UNIT="folio"/>shull thei do youre message as is nede,

I hadde that my frende counseiled with myn enmyes than

Arthur, "I me a-corde, seth the barouns haue it ordeyned;" and
than he seide to the kynge looth, and praide hym to appareile
hym to go secretly that no man knewe whider he wolde go,
with that was Gawein cleped and his brethren that were
pleyinge in the halle; and whan thei come to the quene she
a-roos and wente hem a-geins, and seide thei were welcome,
and thei dide yelde hir a-gein hir salew debonerly.  Than
Arthur tolde hem all as was devised, how thei moste go on
the message, and why thei hadde it a-monge hem purveyed;
and than thei ansuerde and seide that it was goode for to be
done.

</P><P>  After that seide the kynge Looth to sir Gawein, "ffeire
sone, goth forth and appareile yow and youre brethern
that ye faile nought whan we shull go."  "Sir," seide Gawein,
"what a-rayment sholde we haue eny more, but oure armours,
and oure horse; we shull neither haue somer ne male trussed,
netther grete ne small, but goode stedes and swyft, on the

grete iourneyes as we may for soche a nede as this is sholde
not be put in no delay."  "Trewly, nevew," seide Arthur, "ye
sey soth.  Now, go reste yow a-while and slepe."  Than
Gawein turned hym to the quene, and seide, "Madame, I prey
that ye thinke on my felowes that leven here with yow, for
the knyghtes of the rounde table ne love not hem wele in
herte.  But haue to hem envye as ye knowe well youre self, and
parauenture whan I and my brethern be gon, thei will make
som bourde or som turnement a-gein hem, wherefore I praye
yow as my goode ladye that ye suffre hem to make no

noon be; yef my lorde will leve my counseile ther shall neuer
be turnement as longe as the saisnes be in this londe;" and
than the kynge seide, "Be the feith that I owe vn-to yow no

for to slepe and to reste; and thei that were in the

departed, Gyomar ne departed neuer but a-bode spekynge with
Morgain, the sustur of kynge Arthur, in a wardrope vnder
the paleys, where she wrought with silke and golde; ffor she
wolde make a coyf for his suster, the wif of kynge looth.  This
Morgain was a yonge damesell fressh and Iolye.  But she was
som-what brown of visage and sangwein colour, and nother to
fatte ne to lene, but was full a-pert   <MILESTONE N="181a" UNIT="folio"/>auenaunt and comely,
streight and right plesaunt, and well syngynge.  But she was
the moste hotest woman of all Breteigne, and moste luxuriouse,


<EPB/><PB N="508" ID="pb.508"/>

and she was a noble clergesse, and of Astronomye cowde she
I-nough, for Merlin hadde hir taught; and after he lerned hir
I-nough as ye shull heren afterward, and so moche she sette
ther-on hir entent, and lerned so moche of egramauncye, that
the peple cleped hir afterward Morgain le fee, the suster of
kynge Arthur; ffor the merveiles that she dide after in the
contrey, and the beste workewoman she was with hir handes,
that eny man knewe in eny londe, and ther-to she hadde oon
of the ffeirest heed, and the feirest handes vnder hevene, and
sholdres well shapen at devise; and she hadde feire eloquense,
and tretable, and full debonair she was as longe as she was
in hir right witte, and whan she were wroth with eny man,
she was euell for to acorde; and that was well shewed
afterward, ffor hir that she sholde most haue loved of all the
worlde dide she after the moste shame, wherof it was after
alle the dayes of hir lif, and that was the quene Gonnore, as
that ye shull it heren here-after and wher-fore it was.</P><P>  Whan Guyomar entred in to the chambre ther as was
Morgain the ffee, he hir salued full swetly, and she
hym salued a-gein curteisly, and he sette hym down by hir
and helped to wynde the threde of golde, and asked hir what
she sholde ther-with make, and he was a feire knyght and
comly, well shapen, and his visage well coloured, and his heer
crull and yelowe, and was feire and plesaunt of body and of
chere laughinge, and he a-resoned hir of many thinges; and
she be-hielde hym gladly, and was well plesed with all that
he seide and dide; and so longe thei spake to-geder that he
praied hir of love, and the more that she hym be-hilde, the
better she was with hym plesed, and that she gan love hym so
well that she refused nothinge that he wolde hir require; and
whan he aperceyued that she wolde suffre gladly his requeste,
he be-gan hir to enbrace, and she hym suffred, and he be-gan
to kysse hir tendirly that bothe thei be-gonne to chauffe as

quene Gonnore as ye shull here telle, wherfore thei were
departed, and ther-fore she hated the quene, and dide hir after
gret annoye, and of blames that she areised that euer endured
while hir lif lasted.  But now retourne we to kynge looth and
his sones that be go to slepe.</P><P>  A noon as it was past mydnyght a-roos the kynge Looth

goode that thei dide ride on hir iourney; and whan thei were
all redy thei lept on theire palfreyes, and ride oute at the yat

myght, for thei wolde not be a-parceyved of no peple; and whan
thei hadde riden half a walsh myle, Gawein asked whiche wey
thei sholde go; and the kynge looth seide he wiste not, for the
contrey was full of werre.  "Than shall I telle yow," quod
Gawein, "what we shull do; we shull go to Arestuell in
Scotlonde that is now the next londe, and moste full of wode of
all this contrey, and it is better to drawe that wey than to eny
other place;" and the kynge looth seide, "Feire sone, seth
that it pleseth yow I will wele, for youre counseile is goode,
and so shull we go be the castell of Sapine and be the playn
of Reostok, and by the foreste of lespinoye vnder Carenges,

Gringalet, an horse that was cleped so far the grete bounte that
he hadde; ffor as the storye seith for x myle rennynge abated
he neuer his corage, ne hym neded no spore ne no skyn of hym
ther-fore ne sholde not swete; and whan the saisnes hem saugh
ridinge on her weye, thei knewe well by theire armes and hir
conysshaunce that thei were noon of her companye, and thei
hoved and a-bode; and whan Gawein saugh that, he hoved stille
and bad his fader and his brethren to lepe vpon theire horses,
and so thei dide a-noon delyuerly; and the gromes toke the
palfreys and lepte vp and rode in to the foreste that wey
streight as theire wey turned, and thei com toward the saisnes
as the wey hem ledde, for thei deyned not to glenche; and
mydday was than passed, and drough towarde noone, and so
rode the kynge looth formest, and Gawein after, and his brethern
hym be-side, a softe   <MILESTONE N="182a" UNIT="folio"/>paas; and whan thei hadde so riden that

he ne sholde entende to noon other thinge ne coveite but to
perce hem thourgh-out, and to his brethern he seide the same
till thei were come on that other side.  Than the saisnes hem
ascride, and seide, "Ye knyghtes that come ther, yelde yow
and telle vs what ye be and what ye go sechinge;" and the
kynge looth ansuerde, "We ben fyve messagiers of the kynge
Arthur that go on his erunde ther he hath vs sente, and more

but smote in a-monge hem, and eche of hem bar oon deed to

and at foure cours thei haue hem perced thourgh with-oute
eny other discombraunce, and than thei ride a walop with theire

and cried vpon her men, "Now upon hem and lete hem yow not

and so thei chaced hem fiercely, and thei wente forth a grete
walop till thei be come to a Mille, where ther was a passage
at a forde full of cley, and ther moste thei stinte and ride

  </P><P>Whan the kynge looth saugh his horse slain he lept vp

hym to a banke for the clay that was grete; and thei ronne vpon
hym and assailed hym full harde, and he hym diffended so
fiercely that thei hadde no power hym to take; and whan
Gawein saugh his fader on foote, he was full of sorowe, and
smote the horse with the spores that the blode ran oute on
bothe sides, and smote Monaclyn thourgh the shelde and thourgh
the hauberke that he fill deed to the erthe, and in the fallinge
his spere brake.  Than he drough his swerde that was cleped

and smote soche strokes on bothe   <MILESTONE N="182b" UNIT="folio"/>his sides, that he kutte heedes

ther-while is the kynge looth remounted magre alle his enmyes.  Than

quod he, "and yef thei vs enchace let vs turne vpon hem

chaced hem harde, and the kynge Clarion that satte vpon the

Sir Gawein was be-hynde alle his felowes his swerde in his

and Gawein loked and saugh the horse so swyftly renne that

wolde not yeve it for the beste Citee that kynge Arthur hadde,
and than he gan to ride a softer paas, and rode walopinge, and
Clarion hym enchaced faste after; and whan Gawein saugh

sore affraied, and asked his armes, and a-raied hym a-noon, and

herde and comaunded his peple to arme and to lepe to horse,
and comaunded hem to bringe hym a-gein other be force, or be

vndirstode, but he ansuerde hem no worde, but rode forth after

rode a walop; and whan the saisnes saugh that he rode so faste,
thei priked after, and manaced hym sore, and whan he saugh

than a-roos the showte and noyse vpon hym right grete, and
whan he hadde over-take his squyer, he rode forth hym, and
seide he wolde not leve his harneys as longe as he myght it

a-gein so many as were a-boute hym, and so it myght not be but
that he moste be deed or taken, ffor Pignoras and Monaquyns
were come after hym; and than he turned from hem and priked

Agravain, hate ye the doughter of youre hoste for youre foule

"yef ye yow thus demene as ye sey, wite ye well ye shull

the kynge looth speketh to his sone Agravain that was prowde
and fell, and thus thei rode in the foreste till it was paste
pryme.</P><P>  Than thei entred in to a feire launde that dured a-longe to
Roestok a-longe by the wode side; and whan thei hadde

was sore affraied for his lorde that faught at grete myschef as ye

the robes, and ledde his lordes palfrey in his right hande, and
wepte and seide, "Lady seinte marie, vs helpe and socoure;"
and thus he cried often, and smote that oon hande a-gein the

a-perceyved thei hadde grete pitee, and Agravain hasted hym
be-fore, and seide, "Why makest thow this doell and this
sorowe;" and the squyer loked vp and seide, wepinge, "Sir,
I haue cause I-nough wherefore, I wepe for a yonge lorde, the
feireste creature that euer was formed on erthe that the saisnes
haue asseilled in this valey be-nethe, and haue hym slayn,
but god be his helpe and socoure."  "And whider wente he,"
quod Agravain.  "Sir," seide lydonas, "he was goynge to the
Court of kynge Arthur for to seche sir Gawein and hym for
to serue that hath so grete valour as it is seide, ffor   <MILESTONE N="188b" UNIT="folio"/>so moche
he hath herde spoken of hym that he will neuer be made

worde, "Ha! las caytef, now I haue hym loste, and neuer I
shall se hym more," and made so moche sorowe that for litill
he wolde hym-self haue slayn, and Agravain hym asked of
what contrey he was.  "Sir," seide lydonas, "of the reame of

Agravain loked on sir Gawein and seide, "Brother, here ye not what

Agravain, "Now thenke vpon the maydenes that ye this morowe

durste not assaile ne se, and no more shull ye do to the saisnes
as I trowe."  "Sir," seide Gaheries, "ye be elther than I,
and therfore it shall be sene how ye will do better."  "So
god spede me," seide Agravain, "I were but litill to preise,
but I dide better than ye, and elles hadde I but little power,
ffor I will neuer lette for youre cowardise."  "Sir," quod
Gaheries, "at the leste it is no curteisie a man to a-vaunte of
hym-self, but whan ye come ther do the beste that ye can;"
and whan Agravain herde this, he swore and seide he sholde
go in to soche place where he durste hym not sewe, for the
iyen in his heed; and Gaheries be-gan to lawgh, and was
nothinge wroth, but seide all in game, "Go ye than be-fore,
and ye can go in to no place but I shall yow sewe;" and
Gawein lowgh of that thei hadde seide, for he wiste well that
Gaheries pleide and Iaped, and tolde to Gueheret and his fader
the wordes that thei hadde seide; and a-noon the kynge seide,
"Ffeire sones, go we after hem that thei do no folye, ffor I
wote well Agravain is wroth;" and whan lydonas saugh hem
go he asked what thei were, and thei seide thei were of the

will I go no ferther till I wite how it shall be."  "No," quod
the kynge looth, "but turne a litill oute of the weye till thow

thei spake so to-geder thei saugh this other squyer come
prikynge faste with his swerde in hande all blody and CC
saisnes after hym as thei myght ride, and often he turned and
smote hym so that he dide a-reche that noon armoure ne waranted

and Agravain seide, "A-bide and haue no drede."</P><P>  Than Agravain spored his horse and brandisshed his spere
that was sharpe and kene, and smote so the firste that

and Gaheries that com after hym smote a-nother thourgh shelde

spere, and a-noon he drough oute his swerde, and seide with
high voise, "Agravain, brother, where be ye, now lete se what
ye do, ffor I peyne me for these ladyes sake for curtesie, and
ye peyne yow for theire vilonyes."  Of these wordes lough
Gawein and Geheret.  Whan the kynge looth saugh hem laugh

vndirstode these foure knyghtes were his sones, and that he
monestede hem to do well, he asked what he was, and he hym tolde

saugh hym come, and durste not a-bide his strokes, and he was
gon so fer be-fore that he wiste nothinge of his fader, ne his

saisnes; and whan thei saugh how thei were chaced and were
but tweyne, he cried vpon his men and medled hym a-monge
hem, and thei smote tweyne so harde that deed thei fill on the
grene, and than renged hem x saisnes and smote hem on alle
partyes that thei bar Agravain to the erthe, and thei smyte
Gaheries so harde that he bente bakwarde in his sadill be-hynde,
and whan the speres were broken he smote in to the presse
and be-gan to do merveiles, and Agravain was   <MILESTONE N="189b" UNIT="folio"/>lepte on fote
and griped his swerde in hys right hande, and hente his shelde
hym be-forn, and thei hym assailed full harde, and he hym
well diffended as he that hadde I-nough of herte and force,
and Gaheries spored his horse that wey ther he saugh his
brother, and rode be-twene hym and the saisnes that sore hym
assailed, and he hym diffended vigorously, that noon durste
hym a-bide for the strokes that thei saugh hym yeve, and in
this manere thei fought longe while, ffor the saisnes coveited
hem for to take, and thei hem diffended to warante theire lyves;
and the kynge Looth and Gueheret fought right harde, and
wente thourgh the bataile sechinge her felowes, and so thei
fonde Agravain on foote a-monge the saisnes, his swerde in his
honde all naked, wherwith he yaf hem many grete strokes, and
Gaheries was by hym that dide grete peyne hym to helpe and
for to remounte.  Than the kynge looth smote in a-monge hem
and fought sore a-gein the sarazins thei foure and sloughen
many of hem, and sir Gawein hadde so gon that he was come
vpon the hill with his swerde all blody in his hande.  Than
he loked bak and saugh he hadde alle perced thourgh, and the
squyer was by hym at the spore and seide, "Sir, I wolde
sue yow full gladly yef my servise myght yow plese so that
it liked yow for to make me knyght, whiche tyme I wolde yow
requere;" and Gawein ansuerde that he was right welcome,

and with-hilde hym with-oute mo wordes, and than he badde
hym to kepe hym by him that the saisnes dide hym not hurte
ne diffoule, "ffor I moste seche my fader and my brethern that
I ne wote neuer where thei beth be-come;" and than seide the
squyer, "Lo hem yonder in that grete prees, for I se swerdes
lifte a-loufte that bright shyneth, and a-noon Gawein knewe
his fader by the helme, and than he seide, "It is my fader,
sue me."</P><P>  And than he smote his horse with the spores on bothe
sides that he spronge oute xviij foote, and drof in
fiercely a-monge the saisnes more than he hadde don all the day
be-fore he and the squyer that thei throwe down all that be-fore
hem stode, and the squyer cowde not so faste spore hys horse
that he myght hym ouertake, and fonde the wey strowed full
of hem that were ouerthrowen; and than seide the squyer,
"Lady seint marie, I am a-ferde to lese hym here a-monge
these mysbelevinge peple; ffull trewe seide thei that tolde me
ther was not soche a-nother knyght in the worlde, ffor he ne
gabbed no worde, for he hath in hym more goode than was

born of the virgine marie that my fader the kynge hadde hym

devised the squyer what he wolde, and euer sued after Gawein
as moche as he myght; and sir Gawein hath so gon that he
fonde Agravain so wery for traveile that he lened on his shelde
and his swerde in his honde, and myght not helpe hym-self
but litill, and thei yaf hym ever   <MILESTONE N="190a" UNIT="folio"/>a-monge grete strokes with
speres and swerdes as thei myght come to; and on that other
side he saugh that Gueheret was smyte be-twene the sholdres
with two speres that he was born to the erthe vp-right, and
also he saugh xi saisnes that hilde his fader be the helme, and
smote hym with the pomeles of his swerdes; and Gaheries
hadde caste his shelde to the ground and hilde his swerde in
bothe handes, and yaf soche strokes that thei myght be herde


<EPB/><PB N="533" ID="pb.533"/>

right cleer, ffor he smote of handes, and armes, and hedes, and
legges, and slitte hem to the teth, and shewde ther soche
prowesse that noon durste hym a-bide, but lefte the kynge
Looth magre hem alle; and the kynge loked and saugh it was
Gaheries his sone that hadde hym rescowed, he seide, "Ha!
feire sone, yef we hadde youre brother Gawein with vs we shull
nought lese this day for alle these false peple, and Agravain
and Gueheret where be thei."  "Thei be in theire enmyes handes
that nygh haue hem slayn."</P><P>  With these wordes com Gawein brekinge the presse, and
sleinge all that he myght a-reche, as quarell oute of
arblast for swyftnesse of his horse, and hilde his swerde in his
hande and smote on eche side so hevy strokes oute of mesure
that alle yede to grounde that stode in his weye; and the
squyer was euer <CORR SIC=" ">nigh</CORR> hym that for nothinge wolde hym leven,
and yaf many a grete stroke with his swerde, wherfore he was
be-loved after of alle the brethern; and <CORR SIC=" ">it befell</CORR> that mette
Gawein Monaquyn that was oon of the goode knyghtes of alle
the saisnes, and was a-rested vpon Gueheret for to take hym to
pryson.  But Gawein smote hym so harde with Calibourne that
he slitte hym from the sholdre to girdell; and whan the squyer
saugh that, he blissed hym for the merveile that he hadde, and
blessed the arme that soche a stroke yeve; than he caught the
horse be the reyne, and ledde to Agravain, and badde hym
skippe vp lightly, and he dide so a-noon right as he that ther-to
hadde grete nede, and the squyer helde hym the stirop, and
Agravain hym thanked hertely, and seide he sholde hym quyte
yef he myght.</P><P>  Whan Pignoras saugh his brother deed he was sory and
wroth, and gripid an ax with bothe handes, and com
towarde the kynge Looth, and smote hym so sore on the helme
that he fill flatte to the erthe, but he hadde no grete harme
but that he was sore astonyed, and than he smote Gaheries
that he fill to the erthe vp-right, and than was Gawein full
wo, and smote the Gringalet that wey with Calibourne in his
hande, and whan he saugh hym come he covered hym with

his shelde and with his axe.  But Gawein smote the axe helue
a-sondre, and the stroke descended on the shelde and the right
sholdre and slitte hym to the breste, and the squyer caught
the horse and ledde to Gaheries, and he lepte vp delyuerly; and
than he toke the horse that his fader was fallen fro, and brought
it to hym hastely by the bridell, and hilde the   <MILESTONE N="190b" UNIT="folio"/>stirop till he
was vp, and than he made a new assaute vpon hem that so
short hadde hem holden.  But the saisnes were so abaisshed
of theire two lordes that were ther deed that thei turned to
flight, and toke no more hede hem to diffende, and Maundalis
theire stiwarde hem ascried, "Ha, cowarde peple, what do ye
that a-venge yow not on hem that haue youre two lordes slayn
in this maner, and ye se well thei be but vj, and ye be yet
thre hundred, and ye may be a-shamed that thei haue so longe
endured;" and thei returned to the vj, and sir Gawein com
be-fore and mette with hem as he that well knewe their corage,
and hilde Calibourne, his goode swerde, and smote so the firste
that he mette that he fill deed on the grene, and than the
seconde, and the thridde, and than the fourth, and than he
smote Maundalis that the heed fill from the sholderes, and the
squyer caught the horse and ledde to Geheret; and whan the
saisnes saugh theire stiwarde deed, thei turned a-noon to flight,
who that myght sonest, so that noon a-bode other, and thei
hem enchaced that sore hem hated a-bove all thinge, and slough
and smote dowon all that thei myght a-take, and sir Gawein
satte vpon the Gringalet that swyftly hym bar, and he made
a-monge hem soche martire that it was wonder to wite, and
hilde hem so shorte that thei myght hym not ascape vp ne
down, ffor thei myght no side turne, but euer he was be-fore,
and whan thei saugh thei myght not ascape, thei rode in to
the depe of the forest for socour, and fledde oon here, a-nother
there, that thei a-bide nother frende ne brother, and cursed
the hour and the day thei with hem metten, "ffor thei be no

be the prowesse of sir Gawein, and the remenaunt that
ascaped lefte neuer till thei come to the siege be-fore Clarence,
and tolde theire grete damage to the kynge Hardogabran what
the vj knyghtes hadde hem do, ffor thei haue oure two kynges
slain, and oure stiward Maundalis; whan the kynge hardogabran
herde this, he was nygh woode for wrath, ffor the tweyne were
his cosins germain, and cursed the hour and the day that euer
thei entred in to the londe, "ffor," quod he, "we haue resceyved
grete damage."  But now cesseth the tale of the saisnes and
speketh of the kynge Looth.</P><P>  Whan the saisnes were discounfited in the valey of
Rorestok, the kynge looth was gladde for the squyer

that the saisnes sholde haue ledde to the siege before Clarence,
and gadered hem to-geder and be-helde hem gretly; and than
seide Gaheries a worde that was well herde.  "Lord god,"
  <MILESTONE N="191a" UNIT="folio"/>quod he, "why be ther so many pore bachelers in the contrey
whan thei myght thus wynne I-nough.  Certes thei lese
nothinge but for slouthe and cowardise, ffor thei ne sholde not

who that soche thinge will vndirtake yef oon tyme hym happe

Gaheries to his fader, "Sir, aske Agravain my brother yef he

a trauerse full proudly, and seide to hym in reprof, "Gaheries,
it is not longe tyme past that ye hadde no talent to iape whan
the saisne smote yow down of youre horse with his axe, and
ne hadde be Gawein ye hadde mette with hym in euell

this, he was wroth and angry, and for that he cleped hym
recreaunt, wax he rody for shame, and loked on hym with
maltalent, and yef thei hadden be a-lone he wolde with hym
haue foughten; but the kynge turned the wordes in to other
maner, for he wolde not haue in no wise distrif be-twene hem

Agravain sore to wrathe, and seide he sholde it a-beyen, and
hilde a tronchon of a spere in his honde, and smote Gaheries on
the helme that it fly all to peces, and Gaheries remeved not
but suffred; and Agravain recouered and smote twys or thries,
so that nought of the tronchon lefte in his handes, and his
brother Gueheret ne hys fader cowde hem not so departe, but
euer he ran vpon hym as he myght from hem ascape.</P><P>  Than com Gawein from the chace, and asked what a-ray
that was, and the kynge tolde hym all worde for worde;
and Gawein com to Agravain and blamed hym sore for that
he hadde so I-don; and Agravain swor all that he myght swere
that neuer he wolde it hym for-yeve, and whan Gawein
vndirstode the grete felonye, he seide he sholde abye on his body,
but yef he wolde be ruled.  "Ffy," quod Agravain, "in dispite
of the deuell this were of the newe that I sholde lette for yow
to do ought."  "Now shall it be sene," quod Gawein, "what
thow wilt do."  Than Agravain smote the horse with the
spores and ran to Gaheries with swerde drawen, and smote
hym on the helme that the fire sparcled oute.  Ne Gaheries
ne remeved litill ne moche for nothinge that he dide, and whan
Gawein saugh this he drough oute Calibourne and swor by his
fader sowle that in euell tyme he hadde it be-gonne,   <MILESTONE N="191b" UNIT="folio"/>and
whan the fader be-hilde all this, he seide, "Now vpon hym

and Gawein thought well what he wolde do, and com to Agravain, 


<EPB/><PB N="537" ID="pb.537"/>

and smote hym with the pomell of his swerde vnder the
temple that he fill from his horse to the erthe so astoned that
he wiste not where he was; and Gaheries seide to Gawein,
"Sir, be not wroth for nothinge that he doth to me, for he is
fell and proude, and therfore taketh nothinge to herte that he
doth to me ne seith."  "Ffle from hens," quod Gawein,
"mysproude lurdeyn, neuer shall I love the whan thou wilt not
spare for my lorde my fader ne for noon of vs." "Sir," seide
Gaheries, "he is myn elther brother, and it sitteth me to do
hym honour and reuerence.  Ne for nothinge that I dide, ne
seide to him ne dide I but Iape."  "He is a fole and prowde,"
quod Gueheret, "but all that hast thow meved, and therfore
have thow euell happe;" and Gaheries hym ansuerde, "Full

"thow art fell, and for-swollen.  Verile art thow his brother,
for ye bothe be contrariouse, and I comaunde my sone Gawein
that yef thow or Agravain do ought to my sone Gaheries that

Agravain, that he bledde bothe at mouthe and nose,
he ran to take his horse and brought hym by the bridill, and
made   <MILESTONE N="192a" UNIT="folio"/>hym for to lepen vp, and Gawein com to hym and
seide, "Harlot fle from hens, for with the haue I nought to

where thow wilt for with me shalt thow come no more, and go
ye alle forth with hym that love hym better than me and with
me that love my companye;" with that Gawein rode forth

what sholde he do with the somers.  "Sir," seide Gawein,
"ye shall sende hem to Mynoras the forester, that so well dide

squyer of this gentilman, and oon of youre gromes."  "On
godes name," seide the kynge; and a-noon was the squyer
sought till he was founden, and charged with the message and
the present that he sholde make, and after to turne after hem

lefte alle the wordes of reprof that thei hadde spoken, ffor that
thei saugh Gawein was ther-with greved; and than thei ride
to-geder, the kynge, and Gawein, and Gaheries, and asked of the
yonge squyer of whens he was, and what was his name, and
he seide how his name was Elizer, and was the sone of kynge
Pelles of listenoys, and nevew to the kynge Alain of the forain

rode till it was nyght, that thei fonde nether house ne herberowe,
and the foreste was high and full of shadowe; but the weder

soone after mydnyght thei herde a grete complaint of a lady and
of a knyght that passed by, and Gawein ther-of hadde grete pite
and comaunded to sadill the Gringalet and bridill hym in all

and Gawein toke his armes and lept vp delyuerly, and rode

"Ha, lorde god, what shall I do, where haue I deserued to

naked in his breche that v pantoners dide bete with scorges
that the blode ran down by his sides; and on that other side
vndirstode sir Gawein a full dolerouse cry of a woman, and well
it semed that she hadde grete nede of helpe, and she seide so
lowde that Gawein myght it well heren.  "Seint marie, blissed
lady, socoure this wery caytif.  Trewly," quod she, "sle me ye
may well, for I shall neuer to yow concent."</P><P>  Whan Gawein vndirstode the voyce, he wiste well she
hadde grete nede of helpe, and be-thought hym
whiche wey he sholde turne first, for he hadde grete pite of
that gentilman that he herde so waymenten, and on that other
side he hadde so grete pite of the woman that sholde be
diffouled, but she haue the soner helpe, and thought in his herte
that better it were to suffre the knyght to endure his peyne
than the woman to be diffouled while he were in helpinge of
the knyght; and than he smote the horse with spores down
the valey where the voice cried euer more and more, "seint
Marye, goode lady, helpe me and socour;" and as Gawein
behelde he saugh vij pantoners that hilde this lady vnder a tre

"Certes, sle me ye may well, but neuer other thinge shall I
not do;" and for that she seide so, he trailed hir by the tresses
that were so feire, that he griped in his handes, and a-noon as
Gawein it saugh, he cried to hym that hir hilde, "Sir knyght,
lete be that damesell;" and he be-hilde be the mone light,
and cried to hem   <MILESTONE N="193a" UNIT="folio"/>that were with hym to go a-gein hym, and
so thei dide all vj, and asked hym, "Sir knyght, haue we eny
drede of yow;" and Gawein seide he assured hem of nothinge,
"ffor I will helpe that damesell the whiche that pantoner trailed
so vileyusly, and therfore diffende yow fro me;" and than he
spored the Gringalet thourgh hem vj that he mette, and com
to hym that yet hilde the woman be the tresses, and smote
hym with his spere a-gein the breste that the shafte shewed
thourgh the bakke be-hynde, and he fill deed vp-right, and the
other vj com a-gein hym with <CORR SIC="spres">speres</CORR>, and smote hym on the
shelde and sholdres, and on the sides, and he bowed on his
horse nekke, and the tymbir of the speres fly in peces, and than
Gawein dressed hym in his sadell and ficched hym in his
stiropes that the Iren folded, and drough his swerde and smote
so the firste that he mette, that deed he fill to the erthe, and
than he smote a-nother that the sholdre departed from the
body; and the thirde that the heed fly in to the feilde, and
than he a-raught so the fourthe that he slitte hym to the teth;
and whan the other saugh theire fellowes deed, and how at
eche stroke he hadde slayn oon, thei turned to flight and durste
not a-bide; and Gawein com to the maiden and sette hir vpon
his horse hym be-forn, and the two felowes that fledden be
comen to their felowes that were discended vnder an olyvere
hem for to resten, and were leide on the grasse for to slepe;
and as soone as thei com nygh, thei cried with high voise,
"Gentill knyghtes, what do ye here; ffor here is a knyght
that hath slayn Sortibran and foure of oure felowes, and
resceved the lady; now faste rideth after hym;" and whan thei
vnderstode this thei a-rise hastely angry and wroth, and lepe
to theire horse, and ride after Gawein as faste as thei may that

goth to lede the damesell to savete; and now a-while cesse of
hem, and speke of the squyer that is cleped Elizer.</P><P>  A noon as Gawein was turned to helpe he damesell, Elizer
that folowed after, rode thider; ther he herde the voice
of the knyght, and whan he cam there he saugh vj pantoners
holde hym, and hadde so beten hym that he myght not stonde
vp-right, but was falle to grounde, and hadde no power to
speke no worde; and whan Elizer saugh hym in this maner
hit hevyed hym sore, and than he ascried hem, and cleped
hem, "Fitz a-putein lechours why demene ye so that gentilman
so foule what hath he trespased that ye be a-boute to sle hym
in that manere."  Whan thei herde hym so speke thei loked
on hym, and seiden, "What is it to the, for thy wordes ne shull
we nothinge lette;" and than Elizer wax right angry, and
seide he sholde no more harme haue with-outen hym, and he
hilde a grete spere and com toward hem that hilde the knyght,
and alle thei lefte hym, and he smote so the firste that he
mette of the vj that he drof down deed on the playn, and he
drough oute his spere and ther-with he slough a-nother, and
drough it a-gein to hym, and priked his   <MILESTONE N="193b" UNIT="folio"/>horse a-gein, a-nother;
and whan thei saugh hym come, thei made hym wey and
disparbledde here and there, and he smote oon that he ouertoke
so rudely that the spere ran thourgh bothe sides; and whan
he loked after the tother he ne wiste thei were be-come,
ffor thei were fledde in to thikke of the foreste, and it was
but litill past mydnyght that oon myght not se fer; and whan
he saugh he hadde hem loste, he com to the knyght and badde
hym lepe vp be-hynde hym, and whan he vndirstode this, he
hadde for-yete all his peyne, and lepte vp be-hynde hym with
grete peyne, and than he rode the streight wey thider as he
wende to fynde Gawein.  But he hadde but litill gon that he
fonde hym fightinge with xx knyghtes that sore hem peyned
hym for to greve with all theire power, and he hadde sette the
damesell in a thikke busshe a-gein the wode side; and whan
Elizer hym saugh he comaunded the knyght to a-light down,
and he dide so a-noon; and Elizer hente his spere that yet was

thourgh his bakke be-hynde, and Gawein hadde so don with
calibourne his good swerde that he hath slain of hem vij, and
vj that he hadde slain be-fore at the rescew of the lady; and
Elizer hath broke his spere, and drough oute his swerde and
smote so a knyght that he slitte hym to the teth; and whan
Gawein saugh Elizer that so dide hym helpe, he smote the
horse with the spores, and blessed the hour that he com in to
the contrey, and blessed the body that he was of conceyved,
ffor he saugh well he myght not faile to be a noble knyght;
with that he com that wey as he saugh hym holde the medle,
and smote grete strokes, and slough and slitte all that he
ouertoke a full stroke, and so thei two haue don that thei haue
hem alle slain, saf thre that fledde in to the foreste for socour,
and the nyght was woxen so derke with clowdes that thei
wiste not whiche wey that they were fledde.</P><P>  Than toke Elizer two horse, as he that was wight and
hardy at euery nede, and brought hem to the knyght,
and to the damesell, and made hem to lepe vp ther-on; but
first he made the knyght to be clothed in oon of the deed
bodyes robes, for his owen were loste; than thei putte vp theire
swerdes, and ride forth to-geder toward the hermytage, and
than Gawein drough hym to the damesell, and asked hir of
whens she was, and she seide she was suster to the lady of
Roestok, and the knyght was hir cosin germain.  Than seide
sir Gawein, "How were ye thus I-taken?"  "Sir," seide the
damesell, "my cosin and I repeired thourgh the forest and

he me diffended, and neuer me lefte for no feer of deth, but
yaf hem grete strokes and merveilouse as he myght hem atteyne

telle me what ye be, and for what cause ye be come?" and sir
Gawein seide he was a knyght of the reame of logres, "and we
go on soche a nede that we may not telle;" and as thei rode
thus talkynge thei be come to the hermytage, where thei fonde

and hadde well slepte well all the nyght, and saugh Gawein
a-slepe and Elizer, and the maiden and the knyght that were
leide be the horse side, and Elizer hilde the Gringalet be the
halter, for he was somwhat raginge amonge the other horses;
and whan the brethern saugh the mayden lyinge by hem, thei
merveiled fro whens she was come; and the kynge cleped and
seide, "Now arise, Gawein, goode sone, ye haue slept I-nough
se how it is feire day;" and the knyght a-woke that was sore
hurte, for he slepte nothinge wele, ne the maiden neither, and
thei satte vp wakinge; and the kynge asked hem fro whens
thei were come; and the knyght ansuerde and seide, "Thei

whiche oon of hem is a knyght that hath rescewed this maiden,
and the squyer hath rescewed me, god make hym a good man,
and sende hym ioye and honour."  "Whiche ben thei," seide
the kynge, and he hym shewed sir Gawein and Elizer; and
whan Agravain vndirstode this, hym for-thought that he hadde

and she tolde euery worde how it was hem be-fallen, so that
no-thinge was for-yeten; and than thei lepe to theire horse
and rode forth theire wey toward Roestok, and rode so fro
morowe to euen that no distrouble thei ne hadde till thei com

he yede to seche trewys of the princes and the barouns from
the kynge Arthur that the saisness myght be driven oute of the

what wey shull ye go first?" quod he, "from hens;" and he
seide that he wolde be at Arestuell in scotlonde; and than he
seide that he wolde he sholde sende a massenger to the kynge

thei yede to slepe all the nyght well at ese till it was day, that
thei toke leve of the Castelein of Roestok, and of the lady
and the maiden that was rescued, and of the knyght that hem
conveyed a-while on the wey, and than returned a-gein; and
whan the Castelein saugh thei were gon, he toke a massenger
and sente hym to the kynge de Cent chiualers from the kynge

Roestok, he toke the streyght wey toward Cambenyk
be-fore the Castell of leuerop, where he was herberowed a nyght,
and on the morowe he rode till he com a two myle from

wonder it was to here, ffor eche man complayned of his losse

well semed by his armes that he hadde not be at soiourne that

and ther-fore be hym to purchase a-nother, and the Duke seide
he wolde yeve hym a-nother myghty and stronge, and he seide
"gramercye."  Than the Duke asked of the kynge looth, and
praide hym full hertely to tell hym his name, for that he herde
hym clepe Gawein his sone; and he ansuerde that his name
was neuer hidde for no man, ne fro hym sholde it not be kept

many an euell iourney, and many myry dayes haue we hadde

thei saugh comynge the squyer of Elizer, and the yoman that
hadde made the present to Mynoras the forester, and salued
the kynge fro Mynoras, and from his wif and alle his children,

Gaheries be-hilde Agravain his brother, and be-gan to laugh,
and asked lydonas how the doughtres of Mynoras ferden, and
he seide how thei hem salued alle.  "Trewly," quod Gaheries,
"thei haue reson yef thei knewe the dought of my brother
Agravain."  At this worde thei lowen alle bothe Gueheret and

he is the sone of a kynge that is of high lynage, and by his
debonerte is come for to serue sir Gawein my sone, for of hym
he will take his armes."  "So helpe me God," seide the Duke

trewly," seide the Duke.  "Now shall I sey yow," quod the
kynge, "how it shall be.  I haue take a parliament with the

whan the saisnes were driven oute of the londe that thei dide

halowmesse yef god hym sende lif in the playn of Salisbery,
and so seide eche of hem for his partye; and the kynge looth
seide that he wolde not thens remeve till he hadde assembled
all his power, and than thei toke leve eche of other, and
departen, and eche of hem wente in to his contrei, and the londe
was assoiled by the legat; and thei moustred and assembled all

</HEAD><P>Now seith the storie that myri lif ledde the kynge Arthur
and his wif after that the kynge looth and his sones
were departed, and the kynge looth sente to the kynge Arthur
that the trewis were graunted, and therfore was arthur gladde
and iocunde, and the quenes knyghtes, and so were the knyghtes
of the rounde table, and so were also the two kynges that were
brethern; and on the morowe that the tidinges were come to
court Segramor a-ros erly, and Galasshin and Dodinell le sauage,
and armed hem right wele of alle parties, and yede to disporte
in the foreste that was grete and depe, for on the nyght be-fore
hadde thei caste for to a-rise erly hem to pley and disporte; and
whan thei were come thider hit hem liked well, for thei herde
the songe of the fowles and briddes that myrily were entuned,
and thei seiden that thei wolde go serche the forest and the
contrey for to wite yef thei myght finde eny a-uenture where-by
thei myght be preised and comended; and also on that other
side were there dissevered thre knyghtes of the rounde table
from the Courte, and hadde taken straunge armes for thei wolde
not be knowen, and thei desired sore for to mete with the
quenes knyghtes for to prove hem-self a-geins hem; and that oon
of the knyghtes was Agrauandain the brother of Belynans, the
beste knyght destramors that after werred the kynge Arthur.

<EPB/><PB N="562" ID="pb.562"/>

The seconde was Mynoras, and the thirde was Monevall that
was a noble knyght and richely armed of alle pointes, and whan
thei were in the playn felde thei ronne with theire horses oon
a-gein a-nother with-oute smytinge of eny stroke, and than seide
Mynoras to his felowes, lete vs go for to pley vs and disporte in
this foreste to assay yef we fynde eny aventure, and his felowes
therto graunted a-noon with goode chere, and ride forth towarde
the Castell de lespine, for that it was the more auenturouse
than eny other wey, and thus these thre felowes ride in
companye till thei founde thre weyes that made hem departe, so
that eche rode sooll by hym-self as auenture dide falle.  But
now we moste cesse of hem awhile, and returne to speke of
Merlin.</P><P>  Here seith the boke that whan Merlin was departed from
the kynge Arthur from a thiside of Toraise in
Carmelide, that he wente in to Northumbirlonde to Blaise his
maister, that gladde was of his comynge, ffor he loved moche his
companye; and whan Merlin a-while hadde be ther he tolde
hym how the kynge Arthur was spoused to his wif, and how
she sholde haue be by-traied, and how Vlfin and Bretell   <MILESTONE N="200b" UNIT="folio"/>hadde
hir rescewed, and how the false Gonnore was banysshed, and
how Bertelais slough the knyght, and of the turnement that the
knyghtes made be-fore Toraise, and how the kynge Arthur
hadde sente Gawein his nevew to logres for to somowne his
court, and how the kynge loth wolde haue refte a-wey his wif;
and how that Gawein com and hym socoured, and toke his
owen fader, and how the avowis were made at the Court, and
how the quenes knyghtes turneyed a-gein the knyghtes of the
rounde table, and the merveles that sir Gawein ther dide, and
how the kynge Ban yaf counseile to the kynge Arthur that his
knyghtes sholde neuer haue turnement oon a-gein a-nother, and
the counseile that kynge looth yaf for to sende messages to the
princes, and all that be-fill hym and his sones on the wey, and
how the princes were assembled at Arestuell, and how the trewys
were take for to go vpon the saisnes; and Blaase wrote all this
in his boke, and by that haue we the knowinge ther-of, and


<EPB/><PB N="563" ID="pb.563"/>

than Blase asked yef thei myght haue peple I-nowe for to fight
a-gein the saisnes; and Merlin seide, "Nay be-fore that the peple
were come oute of litill Breteigne, and thei of the reame of
Carmelide, and thei of lamball that was longinge to the kynge
Amaunte that Gosenges hilde, and as soone as I go fro hens
I will go fecche the peple of kynge Ban and of kynge Bohors
in the two reames, and make hem to come hider, and I do yow
to wite," quod Merlin, "that ther shull come peple hider of
many londes for the sauacion of theire soules, and for to diffende
the cristin feith, and I do yow to wite it is grete nede that
oure lorde helpe at this tyme, ffor neuer be-fore was ther sein
so moche peple as shall be now at this assemble.  Ne neuer for
no power shull thei be put oute of this londe be-fore that the
princes ben acorded with the kynge Arthur;" and Blase seide
that he a-parceyved well that he loved a lady where-of the
prophesie sholde falle and hadde be seide, and Blase hym preide
full hertely and seide,</P><P>  "Merlin, dere frende, I praye yow for the love of god that
ye will telle me who shall be-gete the lyon to the
two messages, and whan this shall be do."  And Merlin seide
that the terme drough faste on that it sholde be do; and blase
seide that it was grete damage; and yef I knewe the tyme and
place I wolde fain do my peyne it for to cesse; and Merlin
seide, "Write soche lettres as I shall yow devise, and than
shall ye knowe whan ye may hem helpe, and he hem wrote
that seide in this wise, "Cest li comenchemens et li contes des
auentures de pais pur coy li merveilleux lyons fu enseres et que
fitz du roy et de royne le destraindra et couenra qu' il soit
chastes et le myldres cheualiers del monde," and these lettres that
Blase wrote Merlin sette by alle the weyes where the auentures
were, and ne myght neuer be taken a-wey, but by theym that
sholde hem acheve, and ther-fore were the knyghtes the better
willed for to labour.  Ne neuer other-wise was distroied the
grete lyon; and than seide blase, "How is it that I may it
noon other weyes helpe;" and Merlin seide, "Noo."  "And
shall I lyve so longe," quod Blase, "that I may it knowe."

<EPB/><PB N="564" ID="pb.564"/>

"Haa! dere frende," seide Merlin, "ne dowte it not, and
many   <MILESTONE N="201a" UNIT="folio"/>other merveiles shull ye se after these."  Than made
Merlin Blase to write soche letteres as he dide hym devise, and
bar hem ther as he wolde, and sette hem by the passages in
high weyes, and than comaunded hym to god, and than he
wente in to litill Breteigne; and whan he toke his leve of
Blase it was a-boute the houre of pryme, and a-boute the houre of
noone he com in to litill Breteigne, and fonde leonce the lorde
of Paerne, and Pharien that grete chere hym made and ledde
hym with hem full debonerly and were with hym gladde and
myry thre dayes hooll; and on the forthe day thei asked Merlin
why he was come in to that contrey, "ffor we knowe well that
for nought be ye not come," and he hem tolde that thei moste
passe the see with as moche peple as thei myght haue oute of
that contrey.  "Sir," seide leonce, "in to what place shall
we go?" and Merlin seide "to the Roche flodomer, and fro thens
in to the playn of Salisbery where ye shull fynde peple of many
dyuerse langages that alle shull be come thider for the same
cause that ye shull come fore, and ye shull loigge ther by
youre-self with alle youre peple, and remeve yow not till ye se
me a-gein, and loke ye make youre baner all white and ther-ynne
a rede crosse and no more, and so shull haue alle the other
princes that shull come thider, and noon of hem knoweth no
worde of other ne wherefore it is don, and ther-ynne is grete
significacion;" and leonce and Pharien seide this sholde be
don.  "Now," quod Merlin, "loke that ye take with yow alle the
beste peple that ye may haue, ffor I do yow to wite that there
shall be grete multitude of peple a-geins hem."  "And who
shall kepe this londe," seide leonce.  "Haue no doute of the
kepinge," quod Merlin, "ffor ther shall noon a-bide to kepe it,
but lambuges and the nevew of Pharien, and Banyns the sone
of Gracien of Trebes, and Galiers the lorde of the haut moor;
and ye shull lede the hostes of youre two reames, and Grascien
shall lede the hoste of Orcanye, and the stiwarde Antyaume
shall be with yow, and Pharien and Dionys shull lede theym
of Gaule, and loke that ye neuer leve for noon avoir, but with-holde 


<EPB/><PB N="565" ID="pb.565"/>

all the peple that ye may haue of sowdiours yow for to
serve."  And leonce seide that this sholde be do as he hadde
devised.</P><P>  Than Merlin be-taught hem to god, and praied hem to go
hastely, for it myght not be taried, "and I ne may no
lenger with yow a-bide."  "Sir," quod leonce, "god haue yow in
kepinge, for I dare not pray yow to a-bide, for ye knowe better
what is for to do than I."  Than departed Merlin, and com to
Nimiane his love, whiche of hym was gladde and ioyfull as
soone as she hym saugh, and the love of hym encresed so moche
that loth he was to departe, but taught hir grete part of his
connynge; and than he wente in to the reame of lamball, that
was the kynges Amaunte that the kynge Bohors hadde slayn,
and bad Gosengos that he ne sholde leve in no maner but that
he sholde be on the playn of Salisbery at halowmesse with all
his peple, and he seide he wolde be ther with-oute faile.  Than
wente Merlin in to the reame of Carmelide, and dide his message
ther on kynge Arthurs be-halue, and thei seide thei wolde go
thider with good chere, and meved a-noon thiderward with
xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> of bolde men and hardy; and Grascien and   <MILESTONE N="201b" UNIT="folio"/>Pharien and
Dyonis spedde hem so wele that in litill terme thei assembled
xl<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men in the medowes be-fore Gannes; and whan it was tyme
for to meve, these felowes toke theire wey and spedde so theire
iourneyes be londe and be water till thei com in to the playns
of Salisbiry, and ther thei fonde the xij princes that were there
with as moche peple as thei myght assemble to-geder, and ech
kepte his hoste by hym-self, and Nabulall that hadde be stiward
with the kynge Amaunt somowned his peple and assembled hem
to-geder, and preied the sone of the kinge Amaunt for to come
with hym; and he dide his counseile, ffor he was a feire yonge
squyer, bolde and hardy, and hadde loved the quene Gonnore,
and fayn wolde haue hadde hir to his wif, yef he hadde be
knyght, but the werre be-twene the two fadres it letted; ffor
the queene hadde hym desired more than eny other man while
she was a maiden, and yet ech of hem desired other to se, and
sente often messages that oon to the tother <CORR SIC=" ">and</CORR> tokenes.


<EPB/><PB N="566" ID="pb.566"/>
</P><P>  Whan this yonge lorde com to Nabulall that kepte the
reame to the be-hofte of kynge Arthur, he tolde hym
how the kynge wolde fight with the saisnes, "and sente me in
comaundement," quod Nabuall, "that I sholde bringe alle hem
that myght armes bere bothe moche and litill, and therefore I
wolde knowe youre will yef ye will come thider."  And he
seide, "Ye, trewly;" and than was Nabulall gladde, and seide
thei wolde go to-geder to se alle the worthi men of the worlde;
and than Nabulall assembled all the peple that he myght till
he hadde xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and spedde hym so till that he com in to the
playn of Salesbiry; and Merlin com to Bandemagn as soone
as he was departed fro Nabulall and badde hym sende to the
hoste the grettest people that he myght; and the kynge
Bandemagn assembled his peple that he hadde xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>, and Merlin
bad hym a-bide and sende with his hoste Patrides his stiwarde
for to lede his peple, and thei shull finde at the Court Guyomar
and Sadoyne, and Guyret de lamball that shull go with hym,
and helpe to lede thy peple ther as thei shull go; and ther-with
Merlin departed from the kynge and com to logres the same
day that the vj knyghtes were gon hem to disporte in to the
foreste auenturouse, where-of ye haue herde speke a-fore how
thei wente for to seche her auenturous.</P><P>  Whan Merlin com to court, he fonde the kynge Ban, and
the kynge Bohors, and the kynge Arthur, and the
quene that lened oute at the wyndowes of the paleys, and
loked on the medowes, and the thre knyghtes that were go in
to the foreste, that were of the companye of the rounde table
of whom the names were rehersed to yow be-fore; and the lordes
wiste no worde till that Merlin com in euen vpon hem, and
a-noon as thei were of hym war thei ronne ageins hym and
made hym the grettest ioye that thei cowde; and whan thei
hadde spoke to-geder of many thinges, than com Merlin to
Arthur, and   <MILESTONE N="202a" UNIT="folio"/>bad hym sende for all his power in all haste
with-oute taryinge, and dide hym well to wite how the kynge
looth hadde right wele spedde, and tolde hym also how the
straunge peple com oute of <CORR SIC="dyuese">dyuerse</CORR> contrees, bothe on horse and


<EPB/><PB N="567" ID="pb.567"/>

on fote, in to the playns of Salisbery, and he <CORR SIC=" ">asked</CORR> hym what
peple ther com, and he tolde hym how the kynge looth rode with
all his power, "and ye hadde full noble counseile for to take
the trewys, and what peple trowe ye shall come on youre
partye, ye shull haue the power of kynge Ban of Benoyk, and
of kynge Bohors of Gannes, and thei be well xl<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>;" and whan
the kynge Ban and the kynge Bohors vndirstode this, thei sterte
vpon hire feet and asked by whom that was; and Merlin hem
ansuerde a-noon, and seide he hadde do the message hym-self,
"and thei trowed me well god yelde it hem," and the two
brethern ansuerde that ther-of he hadde right well spedde, and
that of nothinge myght he haue made hem so gladde; and than
Merlin seide to kynge Arthur,</P><P>  "Sire," quod he, "wite ye who cometh hider also, ther
cometh Nabulall de Camadayse of the reame of
kynge Amaunt, that the kynge Bohors that is here slough in
bataile, and with hym cometh a yonge lorde that is yet no
knyght, and hider cometh all the power of Carmelide that
Cleodalis the stiward doth lede; but the kynge leodogan ne
cometh not, and all this chiualrie haue I yow somowned, and
therfore I owe to haue guerdon."  And the kynge seide, "Merlin,
I can not sey what I sholde yow ofre, but I will that ye be
lorde of me and of all my londe, for by yow is all that I haue."
"Sir," quod he, "whan I com thus sodeinly vpon yow right
now, what dide ye be-holde so ententifly down the medowes."
Quod the kynge, "We loked on thre knyghtes that we saugh
entre in to the foreste."  "Wote ye euer," quod Merlin, "who
thei be." "No," seide the kynge."  "Wite it verily," quod
Merlin, "that it be thre knyghtes of the rounde table that be
full noble and hardy.  But foles thei ben and folily haue thei
don, for thei be envyouse; and I telle yow trewly that neuer in
theire lif hadde thei so grete nede of socour and helpe as thei
shull haue er thei come a-gein, and all is thourgh her owne
folye."  "Merlin," seide the kyng, "telle me who thei be I
praye yow."  "Sir," quod he, "that oon is Agrauadain des
vals de gailore, and the seconde is Mynoras ly engres, and the

<EPB/><PB N="568" ID="pb.568"/>

thridde is Monevall; and I lete yow wite that thei ne hadde
ride but litill wey er thei shull meete with thre of the queenes
knyghtes that shull fight with hem, and therfore yef ye do
wisely sendeth after hem, ffor but yef thei be departed ther
shull some be deed, and that were grete damage and pite."
"Haa? lorde god," quod the kynge, "who shall go hem for to
disseuer a-sonder."  "Sir," seide the quene, "sir Ewein and
kay the stiward, and Gifflet."  "Sir," quod Merlin, "the quene
seith well, sende hem forth a-noon hastely;" and a-noon the
kynge hem cleped and comaunded hem to armen, and thei dide
so a-noon right, and whan   <MILESTONE N="202b" UNIT="folio"/>thei were redy araide thei com to
the kynge, and asked whider thei sholde go, and Merlin bad thei
sholde go in to the foreste the streight wey to the crosse, "and
ther shull ye finde vj knyghtes fightinge, and loke that ye hem
departe;" and whan thei this vndirstode thei wente out of the
paleis and toke theire horse delyuerly, and rode a grete walop
in haste as thei were comaunded, but er thei were come there
were strokes yoven.  But now we shull returne to speke of the
vj knyghtes how thei haue spedde.</P><P>  As the storie seith the thre knyghtes of the quenes haue
so riden thourgh the foreste that thei haue founde a
feire launde, and thei a-light and rested hem on the grene herbes,
and Galashin seide to his felowes, "Wolde our lorde god that
sir Gawein and his brethern were now here, and we wolde go
se the saisnes yef ye wolde assent;" and than seide Dodinell
the sauage that it were a shrewe to go, for in this foreste is
noon rescettes, and oure horse sholde dyen for the faute and for
hungir; and while thei spake of these thinges, com the thre
felowes of the rounde table disgised of theire armes, for fayn
wolde thei haue be pursued of some of the quenes knyghtes;
and Segramor asked of his felowes yef thei knewe hem ought,
and thei seide, "Nay," and euer thei come faste on.  Than
seide Agrauadain to his felowes, "I se yonder soche thre
felowes that me wolde for-thinke that thei sholde lede a-wey
with hem theire horse hom a-gein."  "How so," quod Mynoras,
"be not we thre as well as thei;" and while thei spake thus,


<EPB/><PB N="569" ID="pb.569"/>

the thre knyghtes laced theire helmes that thei hadde don from
theire hedes for to take the air; and thei lepte on theire horse,
and wolde haue gon theire wey as they thought noon euell,
seth that noon hem nought asked; and whan these other thre
saugh hem goinge, thei hem a-scried with lowde voice, "Iuste
yow be-houeth or elles ye shull vs leve youre horse, and so
may ye passe quyte;" and whan Segramor that vndirstode, he
turned the heed of his horse and seide, "What be ye than
robbours that lyve be soche mysteir, wite it verily whan ye
com home to youre hostell to nyght, ye shull have but litill to
ete of the wynnynge that ye shull bringe from vs, for we yow
diffie."  Than thei smyte the horse with the spores that the
blode stremed oute on bothe sides, and sette the sheldes be-fore
theire brestes and the speres a-gein the assels of theire sadelis;
and whan Segramor and his felowes saugh hem come in this
maner thei dide the same, and com hem for to mete, and fill
so that Segramore and Agrauadain mette with speres a-gein the
sheldes so rudely, that thei perced thourgh-oute, and the
hauberkes brosten agein the lifte side, and Agrauadain felte the
sharpe spere so depe that the blode folowed after; and
Agrauadain brake his spere on Segramours hauberke at the same cours,
and Segramor that hadde herte I-nough and force shof so harde
that he threwe hym to grounde and his horse bothe.  But
Agrauadain that was wight and delyuer, and full of grete
hardynesse, lepte on his feet full lightly and drough his swerde,
and appareiled hym self   <MILESTONE N="203a" UNIT="folio"/>to diffende, and whan Segramor hadde
parformed his cours he drough a litill a-side and sette foot to
grounde, and tacched his horse to his spere, and Agravadayns
horse ran faste to the wode, and Segramor drough his suerde
and dressed his shelde, and com towarde Agravadain a grete
spede, and he com for to mete hym vigerously, and smyte grete
strokes vpon the helmes, and over all ther thei myght atteyne,
and so endured the medle of hem longe while; and Segramor
seide, "Sir knyght, thow art deed, but thow yelde;" and
Agrauadain ansuerde "that to that pointe was he nothinge yet
comen;" and Segramor seide he sholde come ther-to soner than


<EPB/><PB N="570" ID="pb.570"/>

he wende, and that other ansuerde that right litill he hym
douted, and seide he cowde well manace; and Segramor seide
that verily it was the maner of a fooll, and ther-fore is seide a
proverbe, that foles love neuer a thinge till he take the a-coole,
and so is it yow be-fallen.  Than thei ronne to-geder and fought
longe, but Agravadain hadde the werse of the bataile.</P><P>  On that othir side mette Galasshin and Mynoras, and fill
that Mynoras brake his spere vpon Galashyns shelde,
and Galashin hym smote with soche vigour vpon the penon of
the shelde that he shof the spere thourgh his thigh, and thourgh
the horse flanke that thei fill to grounde vpon an heep, and his
horse slode also with all foure feet that he also fill to the erthe,
but soone was he vpon his feet, and so was Mynoras, and
drough theire suerdes, <CORR SIC="and and">and</CORR>   be-gonne the medle be-twene hem
two full grete and fell with all theire power.</P><P>  And also ran to-geder Dodinell le sauage, and Monevall,
and mette with speres wher-of the hedes were sharpe
I-grounden that the sheldes were perced and stinte at the
hauberkes that were harde, and the speres bothe fly on peces;
and in the passinge forth Dodinel hurteled so harde with his
shelde and his body that Monevall fill to grounde, but a-noon
he a-roos a-gein, for he was hardy and delyuer; and whan
Dodinell hadde parformed his cours he returned with swerde
drawen, and fonde hym redy hym to diffende.  Than he drough
a litill a-side and a-light, and com with his suerde in honde
gripinge his shelde, and be-gonne to medle and to scirmyssh
strongely.  Thus faught these vj knyghtes longe from prime to
mydday, and the quenes knyghtes be-gonne to gete grounde
vpon hem of the rounde table, and somwhat ledde hem at hir
volunte; and whan thei saugh hem glenche thei hem ascride,
and seide, "Yelde yow;" and thei seide thei hadde lever be
deed; and whan thei saugh it wolde noon other be thei ronne
vpon hem fiercely, and Segramor saugh that his felowe wolde
not yelde, and he lepte to hym lightly, and hitte so Agravadain


<EPB/><PB N="571" ID="pb.571"/>

on the helme that he slitte it on two partyes, and the coyf of
maile that he wounded sore hym in the heed that he fill to
grounde all a-stonyed; but he lay not longe, for he douted sore
a-nother stroke, and covered hym vndir his shelde the beste
that he myght, and Dodinell caste a stroke of skirmerye to
monevall, and smote hym so harde vpon the arme that he hilde
with his shelde, that the shelde fill   <MILESTONE N="203b" UNIT="folio"/>to grounde that ner he
hadde hym shente; and Galashin smote so Mynoras on the
helme that he bente down to the erthe, and fallen hadde he;
but as he kepte hym on his handes, and than Galashin hente
hym by the helme and raced it of his heed so felliche that nose
and browes bledde, and yaf hym soche a buffet with his swerde
that he fill flatte to grounde, and than he lepte to and a-valed
the coyf of maile from his heed and seide he wolde smyte it

"Sir," seide the kynge looth, "as of apparailinge be-hoveth
Merlyn to devise, ffor he shall comaunde, and we shull do his
comaundement; ffor he knoweth better what we shull do than
we knowe oure-self;" and the princes seide that ther-to acorde
thei well, and so thei putte the rule all to Merlin, and
ther-with lefte the speche; and the kynge   <MILESTONE N="207b" UNIT="folio"/>Arthur repeired hem
to his teinte, and alle the princes hym conveyed bothe prive
and straunge, and after eche of hem repeired to his pavelon;
and the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and Merlin entred
in to the chambre of Arthurs Pavelon, and than seide Merlin
in counseile, "Ffeire lordes, these peple that be comen here
ben wery of traueile, ffor some ther be that be come right ferre,
and thei haue nede of reste and ese, and therfore will I that
thei reste to-day and to-morowe, and on monday by goode
distyne we shall meve alle to go towarde Clarence, for ther is
the moste plente of saisnes, ffor thei that were at the sege of
Valdisbery be ther alle assembled, and I shall do euery prince
to wite by hym-self that thei be appareilled the same day to

the thre kynges sir Gawein with hem, and seiden alle be it so
in the honour of Ihesu criste and his moder Marie, and than

thei departed from this counseile, and com to the maister
pavelon and ther a-bide.  Than com Elizer, Gaweins squyer,
and kneled down be-fore sir Gawein, and seide, "Sir, I am
come oute of lytenoys, and lefte the kynge Pelles my fader for
to seche yow, and by the will of oure lorde I fonde yow in
soche place that but god hadde sente yow thider I moste haue
ben deed; but the grete prowesse of yow rescowed me from the
saisnes that me wolde haue putte to deth, and ther-fore I knowe
well that the renomee that renneth of yow thourgh the worlde
is trewe, and I knowe also verily that of a more worthi man
than ye myght I not take my garnementes wher-fore I pray
yow and requyre of youre grete fraunchise that ye make me
knyght.  So that I may prove my firste chiualrye vpon these
false mysbelevinge peple that thus desire for to destroye holy
chirche, ffor I shall neuer be knyght of all my lif tyme, but
I it resceyve of youre hande, and ye it me promysed the firste
day that I yow saugh that ye shull me yeve armes at my
request, and I yow require be-fore my lorde the kynge youre
vncle that is here be-fore this baronye."  Whan sir Gawein
saugh Elizer his squyer be-fore hym on his kne, he a-reised
hym vp be the armes, and seide swetely, "Dere frende, I
graunte youre request, ffor ye be full digne to resceyve the
ordre of chiualrie, and ther-fore all youre will shall be
performed."  "Sir," seide the yonge lorde, "gramercy."  Than
sir Gawein be-helde and saugh Gaheries his brother, and seide,
"Feire brother, do ordeyne me armes soche as is a fieraunt for
a kynges sone, and to so noble and worthi a man as is this."
"What is he than feire nevewe," seide Arthur.  "Sir," seide
Gawein, "it is the sone of kynge Pelles of lytenoys, and is
nevewe to the kynge pellenor and to the kynge Alain, and
wite ye well yef he lyve he shall be oon of the beste knyghtes
of the worlde."  Than he tolde the kynge of the grete occision
and the merveile that he hadde sein hym do of the saisnes;
and whan the kynge it herde he hadde grete wonder how so
yonge a childe myght endure so grete dede of armes, and the

comaunded to   <MILESTONE N="208a" UNIT="folio"/>Gaheries that he sholde do be brought the
richest armes that myght be founde in his cofers, "and the beste
swerde after myn owne."  "Sir," seide Elizer, "I haue armes
and horse and al thinge that is to me mystier."  Than he
cleped lydonas his squyer and badde hym bringe his armes
that his fader hadde hym yoven, and lydonas dide his
comaundement as he that was ioyfull and Gladde, and brought hem
be-fore the kynge and the other barouns that hem be-hielde for

and his hauberke was stronge and well holdinge of double

myght it bere, and arthur preysed it moche, and the other
barouns whan thei it saugh; and sir Gawein armed Elizer, and
Gaheries dide hym helpe, and dide on his hauberk that was of
grete bounte that in all the hoste was not the pareile.  Than
thei laced his aventaile that was as white as snowe, and whan
he was all apareiled, sir Gawein dide on his right spore and
girde his swerde on his side, and Gaheries dide on his lefte
spore; and whan he was thus araied sir Gawein yaf hym the

deboner knyght of the worlde.  "Holde, feire swete frende, and
resceyve the ordre of chiualrie in the name of Ihesu crist oure

Arthur that made grete ioye to Elizer; ffor he satte that day
at the kynges table be-twene the kynge Ban and the kynge
Bohors, and after mete their dide reise a quyntayn on the plain,
and these yonge bachelers yede hem to prove, and so dide the
knyghtes of the rounde table and other, and that day was many

wolde it not suffre, for he douted that some sholde ben hurt,
and therfore was it lefte, and repeired hem to their teintes
gladde and myry.</P><P>  Than com Merlin to the kynge Arthur, and seide, "Sir,

wente Merlin to the pavelons of the princes, and tolde oon

princes at the be-gynnynge of theire comynge; and Merlin
rode on a grete grey courser and bar the baner of kynge Arthur
be-fore all the hoste, and thus thei departed alle in this maner
from the playn of Salisbiry, and wente alle as Merlin dide

and the foure kynges swor that thei wolde neuer departe thens

and so was the Quene taken and the stiward slain, whereof was
grete harme, and the squyers fledden, and were wounded sore,
ffor that oon was smyten thourgh the body with a spere, and
the tother on the heed with a swerde, and so thei wente as

how the saisnes ledde a-wey the Quene, "and whiche wey wente

"Sewe me, ffor the Quene shall thei not lede yef god will."

Than he spored his horse and sir Gawein after, and Elizer, and

Dioglus that was the stiward of the kynge Magloras, and turned
the heed of his horse, and he and Elizer mette with speres
vpon the sheldes so harde that thei perced vpon the bokeles,
and Dioglus brake his spere, and Elizer hym smote so harde
that he shof the spere thourgh the breste, and caste hym down
deed to the erthe, and his spere ther-with fly in peces.  Than
he drough his swerde and launced in a-monge the other that
sore hem peyned to passe the pray, and smote so Antidolus
that was stiward to the kynge Brandon that he slitte hym down
to the teth; and Gawein seide to Merlin that he hadde wele
be-gonne as of a newe knyght.  "Ye," qoud Merlin, "yet

Arthur, and than spronge forth Gawein and his companye
a-monge the forreyours that many were there slain and wounded;
and thei be-hoved to forsake place and fledde toward Garlot
where the kynge Magloras was, and the kynge Brandon, and the

the kynge Bohors, and Elizer make of her men so grete slaughter,
thei ascride her men, and be-gonne to sle horse, and men, and

strengest peple of the worlde; and thei made the peple of kynge
Ban and kynge Bohors to blush vpon the peple of kynge Ventre,
and vpon the bateile of the Duke Escam of Cambenyk, and
ther   <MILESTONE N="209b" UNIT="folio"/>suffred sir Gawein, and the kynge Ban, and his brother,
and Elizer many sharpe strokes, and full sore were thei greved;
and whan these two bateiles were come on, ther myght men
se merveiles don of armes, and sore were the saisnes greved
at that enuay, ffor many there were of hem leide to the

vndirstode Elizer that kepte hym euer nygh Gawein and smote

closed the saisnes rounde a-boute, and the bateile was grete and
horible, ffor the Bretouns were noble knyghtes; and whan
Merlin saugh the hostes were assemled on bothe sides, he
cleped Gawein, and Elizer, and the kynge Ban, and the kynge

ride," quod Gawein, "and we shull yow sue."  Than Merlin
rode forth his weye, and well an hundred knyghtes in his

Quene of Carlot that was the wif of kynge Ventre.</P><P>  Whan the xl saisnes were past the bateile two myle, thei

this day shall departe the love of me and of yow; ffor I trowe
yow neuer to se no more;" and than she swowned in theire
armes that hir hilde, and whan she was oute of his swownynge
she cried and made grete sorowe, and the saisnes were ther-of
doelfull and wolde well she hadde be in place that she hadde
liked beste, and counforted his moche, but ther-of was no nede;
ffor she braied and cried lowde, so that Gawein and his

Margouns the botiller of kynge Pignores herde sir Gawein thus
speke, he asked of his felowes what was her rede, and thei
seide thei hadde leuer to dye than leve the Quene.  "And to
that ar ye come a-noon," quod Gawein.  Than he ran to hem
with swerde drawen, and smote so the firste that he mette that
the heed fill on the grene   <MILESTONE N="210b" UNIT="folio"/>be-fore his aunte, and the saisnes
sterte vp a-noon, and the myschef was grete, for that thei were

for thei were of grete prowesse, but ther-of myght not a-vaile,
for alle were thei deed, that nought oon ascaped, saf only
Margons the botiller that hidde hym in a bussh, and sir Gawein
and his companye com a-gein to the Quene, and counforted hir
swetly, and she hem asked what thei were.  "Madame," he
seide, "I am Gawein, youre nevewe, the sone of kynge looth
of Orcanye, and this lorde that is here is the kynge Ban of
Benoyk, and these other kyghtes ben oure felowes."  Whan
the lady this vndirstode she was gladde, and thanked hem
hertely of the socour, and than thei sette hir on a palfrey that
thider was brought, and returned to the hoste where-as was
the kynge Arthur and the other princes fightinge; and many
of her frendes loste the cristin er the saisnes myght be
discounfited.  Whan Arthur hadde slain Magloras the kinge that
was the sustenement of the saisnes, and the kynge looth hadde
smyte of the hande of the kynge Syuarus, than fledde thei alle;
and whan sir Gawein and his companye were returned, the
hoste enchased the saisnes so nygh euer at the spore; and
Brandons returned often, and he ne smote noon a right stroke,
but he were ther-with a-noon deed; and whan sir Gawein saugh
hym so demene, and saugh the grete slaughter that he made of
the peple, he thought wele that he was som high lorde of grete
lynage, and wele it shewed by his armes that he were a kynge
or a prince, and Gawein preised hym moche in his herte, and
fain wolde he hadde be cristin yef it myght haue be, and seide,
"Knyght, thow art right bolde and full of grete hardynesse, art

"In feith," quod he, "my name is Brandouns, and am kynge
of a partye of Saxoyne, and am nevew to the richest kynge of
all the world, that is the kynge hardogabrant, that is chief
lorde of all Saxonie."  "Certes," seide Gawein, "it semeth
well, for in the is grete valour and high prowesse, and it is
grete harme that thow art no cristin, and fain I wolde that
thow so were to respite the fro deth."  "Of that," quod the
kynge, "that thow spekest haue I merveile, for I haue lever
to be deed than to be cristin."  To that shalt thow come
hastely," quod Gawein, "and that me repenteth sore, ffor
moche wolde I love thy companye yef it the liked."  "Hit
shall neuer me plese," quod Brandouns; and whan Gawein that
herde, he ran vpon hym full Irousely, and smote hym so with
Calibourne his good swerde that the heed clef a-sondre; and
whan the saisnes saugh theire lorde deed, thei were sore
dismayed; and after that in hem was litill defence, and the
cristin hem wounded on euery side, and hem slough, and all
to-hewe; and whan thei hadde do this, thei thanked moche
oure lorde of the grete honoure that he hath hem do at this

the kynge Arthur, and be-fore all the baronye, and presented
the kynge Ventre with his wif, and tolde herynge hem alle
how he hadde hir rescowed, and the kynge hem thanked hertely,
and made grete ioye, and alle the barouns were gladde, and
than thei drough a litill a-side from the felde where the bataile

sorowfull and pensif.  Than sterte vpon his feet the kynge
Gondofles, and seide to the kynge Hardogobran, "Sir, yef it

wonder light and delyuer, and full of high prowesse to furnyssh
a bateile, and at the firste brunt was many a cristin leide to

Cleoles, but thei fonde his lifte arme broken in the falle that

that thei come to a Castell that stode in a maresse, so wele and
so feire sittinge, and so cloos that it douted noon assaute, and
this Castell was closed rounde with   <MILESTONE N="215a" UNIT="folio"/>vij walles thikke and
high, and feire enbateiled, and right deffensable; and with-ynne
the bailie were v. toures that were high and streight all rounde,
and foure were mene, and the fifthe was gret and high, and
well hurdeysed a-boute with-ynne and with-oute, and grete
diches, and depe full of water, and the dongeon that stode in
the myddill was grete and high, and all a-boute the walles of
the Castell was marasse that dured two myle so full of myre
and water that noon myght come ther-to, but he were
drowned.  In to this castell was but oon entree, and that was so streite
that two horse myght not ther-on mete, oon be-side a-nother;
and a-bove this marasse was a chauchie fro place to place of the
breede of a spere lengthe made of chalke and sande stronge
and thikke and wele made, and this cauchie was of lengthe
a stones caste, and the remenaunt was made of plankes and of
tymbir, so that noon ne myght passe ouer yef the plankes hadde
be take a-wey, and at the ende of the cauchie was a grete water,
but ther-to com no shippes, but it was right feire and plesaunt,
and good fisshinge; be-fore the foot of this cauchie was a pyne
tre a litill fro the water in a medowe of the space of an acre

londe or more, where-ynne the grasse was feire and high, and
the pyne tre was right feire and full of bowes, so that oon
braunche passed not a-nother of height, and vpon a braunche of
this pyne was hanged by a cheyne of siluer, an horne of yvorie
as white as snowe, ffor that thei sholde it sowne that com for
to be herberowed in the castell, or elles who that passed forth
by that wolde aske Iustinge.  Of these two thinges serued the
horne that ther was hanged.</P><P>  Whan the kynge Ban, and the kynge Bohors, and her
companye come to the pyne, and saugh the horne
that ther did hange, thei seide that for nought was it not sette,
and a-noon thei supposed it was for to aske passage of the foorde
or elles to aske Iustes.  But thei saugh the Castell so fer fro
thens that thei trowed not the sounde of the horne myght not
thider ben herde, and on that other side thei saugh the Castell
so feire and so riche and well??sette, that thei hadde neuer seyn
noon soche of the grettenesse, and saugh the cauchie and the
entre so stronge, and so streite, that thei were alle merveiled;
and the two kynges seide to Merlin, and asked yef he knewe
what the castell was cleped that was so feire and well closed;
and Merlin seide it was the castell of marasse, and was longinge
to a knyght that was of grete puyssaunce, and of grete renon,
and ther-to he was bolde and hardy at armes, and his name is
Agrauadain ly noire.  "Certes," seide the kynge, "of Agrauadain
haue I herde well speke in many a place, and so helpe me
god he ought wele to be a noble man that is here so well
herberowed; ffor a-bove alle the Castelles that euer I sigh is
this the feirest, and gladly wolde I lye ther-in to-nyght."
"To that shull ye well come," quod Merlin; "but no straunge
<CORR SIC="knygh">knyght</CORR> cometh to this castell er he haue sowned this horne, ne
noon dar very ouer the water er he haue blowe this horne, ffor
than shall he not passe with-oute bateile."  "I will sowne
the horne," seide the kynge Ban, "yef ye   <MILESTONE N="215b" UNIT="folio"/>will yeve me leve."
"In feith," seide Merlyn, "ther-in is no pereile, but other to
aske a Iustinge or elles the feriage."  "In feith," seide the
kynge Ban, "and though ther were more pereile I shall it


<EPB/><PB N="606" ID="pb.606"/>

sowne, seth that ye graunte me ther-to leve."  "And I will
well it so be," quod Merlin; "ffor yef god will, ther-of shall
come noon euell."  A-noon wente the kynge Ban to the horne,
and sette it to his mouthe, and blew it so high and so cler as
he that I-nough hadde of force and powere and breth, that all
the marasse ther-of resowned, and the sowne of the water and
the marasse bare the sownde in to the castell, that the lorde of
the place it herde, and a-noon he asked his armes, for so was
his custome; and the kynge be-gan to blowe a-gein thries
to-geder lightly, for the Castell was so fer that the kynge wende
the noyse myght not haue come thider.</P><P>  Whan the lorde of the Castell herde hym blowe so harde,
and that he was so hasty, he hilde ther-of grete
dispite, and for anger lepte on a grete stede in haste with shelde
a-boute his nekke, and his spere in honde, and a-noon the yate
was open; and he rode oute a grete raundon, and com to the
foorde, and whan he saugh the peple on the tother side, he
cried and asked what peple thei were; and the kynge Ban
ansuerde, "Sir, we be knyghtes, that requere herberowe this
nyght yef it plese yow, and feriage for oure horse at this
foorde."  "With whom be ye," guod Agrauadain.  "Sir,"
quod Merlin, that was nigh; "we be of this other contrey of
the partyes of Gaule."  "And of what parties of Gaule," quod
Agrauadain.  "Sir," seide Merlin, "thei holde theire londes
of god and of kynge Arthur."  "In godis name," seide
Agrauadain, "thei haue a gode lorde, ffor of the kynge Arthur may
thei not empeire, for he is a noble kynge, and a good knyght,
and he is my lorde, and for his love shull ye haue hostell
at youre volunte."  "Gramercy, sir," seide the kynge; than
a-noon right Agrauadain hym turned, and badde the knyghtes
hym sewe, and seide thei were alle welcome; and thei wente
a-noon after hym oon after a-nother ouer the bregge to the
gates of the castell, and entred in after that the lorde of the
place was entred, ffor ther was no space to turne on his horse
er he were entred and paste the yate; and than the lorde
hym-self condited hem in to the castell, and a-noon lepen oute squyres

<EPB/><PB N="607" ID="pb.607"/>

and yomen to make hem a-light, and the lorde toke the two
knyghtes be the hande, for that hym semed thei were princes
and lordes of the othere, and ledde hem in to a chambir of the
tour hem to vn-arme, and hym-self dide helpe for to vn-arme,
and ther-while entred in thre maydenes of right grete bewte,
wher-of tweyne were neces vn-to agrauadain; and the thridde
was his doughter, and thei brought thre mantels furred with
ermyn, and the cloth was scarlet, and thei caste hem vpon the
two kynges; and the thridde vpon Agrauadain, and the kynge
Ban that was a lusty knyght be-hilde the maydenys, and liked
well theire companye, and countenaunce that were right feire
and of grete bewte, that it was wonder to be-holde, and alle
thre were of feire age, ffor the eldest was but xiiij yere, but
a-bove alle the other was the lordes doughter the feirest; and
Merlin be-hilde hir with grete anguyssh, and thought in his
herte that   <MILESTONE N="216a" UNIT="folio"/>well were he that with soche a creature myght ly,
"and ne were the grete love that I haue," quod he "to
Nimyane, my love, I sholde haue hir this nyght in myn armes, and
seth I may not hir haue, I shall lete hir be knowe with the
kynge Ban;" and than he made a coniorison softly, and a-noon
as he hadde it made the kynge Ban loved the mayden, and
she hym also right sore.</P><P>  Whan these two knyghtes were araide with these two
mantels that the maydenys hadde brought, than
Agrauadain, the lorde of the castell, sette hym down by hem, and
loked on these two kynges, and knewe hem a-noon; and than
he made hem gretter chere than he hadde do be-forn, and dide
hem more reverence; and whan it was tyme to go to soper,
the clothes were spradde vpon the tables thourgh the paleys
that was grete and large, and the two kynges that were
brethren satte down at the high table, and made agrauadain
sitte down by hem and his wif that was a feire yonge lady of
xviij yere of age, and the knyghtes were sette at other tables
thourgh the halle, and the thre maydenys that were so feire
and auenaunt were stondinge be-fore the two kynges, and be-fore
Agrauadain; and Merlin that was with hem transformed in to


<EPB/><PB N="608" ID="pb.608"/>

the semblaunce of a yonge knyght of xv yere age, and was
clothed in a short garnement party read and white, and was
girt with a bawdrike of silke of brede of a spanne wele and
richely harnysshed with golde and stones, and ther-on hinge
a gipser or purpill samyte bete with golde, and hadde a peire
of gloues hanginge hym be-hynde, and his heed was yelow
and curle, and his iyen grey and grete in his heed, and kerved
be-fore the kynge Ban knelinge, and he was moche be-holden
of oon and other, ffor ther was noon that hym knewe saf the
two kynges, ffor tho that were her meyne wende he hadde be
with the lorde of the place, and for his grete bewte the
maydenys be-hilde hym often ententifly.  But the doughter of
Agrauadain hadde sette hir iyen moste vpon the kynge Ban
more than on eny othir thinge, for the coniurison that Merlin
hadde made, and putte hir to grete affray; and she liked hym
so well that it made hir to chaunge colour ofte sithes, and longe
her thought er the clothes were taken vp, ffor fain wolde she
haue leyn be-twene his armes, and she cowde not wite how
that volunte to hir com.  But so moche she hath ther-on sette
her thought, that to noon othir thinge she toke no tent but to
thenke of hym.</P><P>  In this thought and this anguyssh was the mayden by the
coniurison of Merlin; and on that other side was the
kynge Ban so a-raied that he left pley and laughinge at the
table, and cowde not wite how it was to hym come, and he
was sory and wroth of that he hadde his love so turned, ffor he
hadde to wif a yonge lady of grete bewte, to whom he ne
wolden not false his feith; and on that other side he thought
how he was herberowed ther-ynne, and the lorde of the place
was a noble man and a curteyse, and hadde hym don grete
honoure, and hym semed it were vntrouthe and treson, and to
grete vilonye sholde it to hym turne yef he required hir of
shame or dishoneste.  Ne no gretter shame myght he hym do
than diffoule his doughter in soche maner; and   <MILESTONE N="216b" UNIT="folio"/>ther-with he
wax so euell at ese that he wiste not what to do, and alwey he
seide in his corage that he wolde neuer hir requyre of no soche

thinge.  But Merlin thought wele in his herte that so sholde
it not go, ffor he thought it hadde be grete harme yef thei
hadde not come to-geder, ffor soche fruyte sholde come be-twene
hem wher-of all the londe of Breteigne sholde be honoured by
the grete prowesse that he sholde haue.</P><P>  All thus seide Merlin to hym-self; and whan the clothes
were drawen, and thei hadde waisshe theire handes
thei yede to the wyndowes, and be-helde the marasse; and on
that othir side thei saugh the foreste and the forteresses that
were ther a-boute, and the erable londe and the feire fisshinge,
and saugh the vynes and the contrey so feire that merveile it
was to be-holden; and ther thei stode till it was tyme to go
to bedde, and entred in to a chambre by the halle where the
maydenys hadde made redy two beddes soche as apertend to
two soche princes, and thei were brought to bedde with grete
ioye and feste; and whan the two kynges were brought to
bedde, the lorde of the place wente to bedde with his wif, and
the thre maydenys lay in a-nother chamber next by the chamber
of Agrauadain, so that noon myght entre but thourgh his
chamber; and a-noon as thei were a-bedde, Merlin be-gan an
enchauntement, and made hem to slepe alle that were
with-ynne the Castell saf only the kynge Ban and the
mayden.  These tweyne were so surprised that oon vpon that other, that
thei myght nother slepe ne reste, and Merlin, that wolde acheive
that he hadde be-gonne, com in to the chamber ther the mayden
lay, and toke hir softly by the hande and seide, "Now, feire
lady, a-rise, and come to hym that so moche yow desireth;" and
she that so sore was enchaunted myght not with-sey his volunte,
but a-noon a-roos vp oute of hir bedde naked saf, she first dide
on hir smok, and Merlin her ledde by her fader beddes side,
and by the beddes of other knyghtes ther-ynne; but thei were
so stronge a-slepe, that thei myght not a-wake.  Thus wente
Merlin and the mayden till thei com in to the chamber ther
the two kynges lay, wher-ynne was light I-nough, and fond the
kynge Bohors sore a-slepe, as he that was in the power of
Merlin, and thei com streight to the kynge Ban that was at

moche mysese, and seide, "Sir, lo here the gode <CORR SIC=" ">and</CORR> the feire
whiche shall bringe forth the feire and the good, of whom the
grete renomede shall renne thourgh all Breteigne."</P><P>  Whan the kynge saugh the mayden, and he hadde
vndirstonde Merlin, a-noon he spradde his armes, and hir
resceived gladde and myry, as he that moste do the
comaundement of Merlin, and he hadde no power it to with-stonde, for
the enchauntement wher-with he was so surprised that he
myght it not forsake in no maner; ffor yef it were in poste he
wolde it not haue do for all the reme of grete Breteigne, for
sore he dredde oure lorde; and satte vp and resceyved the
mayden in his armes, and she dide of hir smok, and leide hir
down by hym, and her toke in his armes and she dide hym,
and eche of hem made feire chere and right good semblaunt, as
thei hadde be to-geder xx yere, for noon of hem was a-shamed
ne dismayed of other, and all this hadde Merlin it
ordeyned.  In this manere   <MILESTONE N="217a" UNIT="folio"/>was the kynge and the damesell till day, and
than com Merlin to the kynge Ban, and seide that it were tyme
that the damesell yede a-gein, and she dide on hir smok and
hir kirtill; and the kynge toke a ringe of his fynger, and side,
"Swete love, kepe this ringe for my love;" and the damesell
it toke and sette it on hir finger, and so thei departed; and
Merlin brought hir a-gein in to hir bedde, and made hir to ly
down all naked that hadde conceyved a sone, of whom launcelot
after hadde grete ioye and honour for the bounte and Chiualrie
that was in hym.  Whan Merlin hadde brought the damesell in
hir bedde, he wente to his owne bedde and lay down, and than
brake the enchauntement, and alle that were in the castell
a-woke, and it was than feire day; and than a-rise knyghtes and
squyres, and alle seruauntes, and made redy theire armures,
and sadeled theire horse, and trussed coufres and males, and
Merlin com to the kynge that was a-slepe, ffor the
enchauntement of the love of the damesell was cessed, and he wiste well
that he hadde by hir leyen, but he knewe not in what maner
ne how he hadde hir in his bedde, saf he supposed it was by
Merlin; and Merlin com to hym, and seide it was sone tyme

were ther-ynne; than com the lorde and the thre damesselles to
the two kynges and salued, and thei hem grete a-gein godely;
and whan the kynge Ban saugh the doughter of Agrauadain
that al nyght hadde leyn with hym he be-heilde hir full
ententifly, and she hym full swetly bowinge down with the
heed as she that was shamefaste, that she hadde be so prevy
with hym, and that she hadde be so-bolde; and but yef the
force and the enchauntement hadde not cessed, she ne hadde
ther-of be nothinge a-baisshed for hym, and ther was neuer
hour after but she hym loved more than eny other man, and
that shewed well, for neuer after that wolde she neuer haue
a-do with no man, but seide to hir-self that a woman that
hadde ben so with a kynge ne ought neuer be so famyler with
noon other man of lower degre.  Ne neuer after wolde she be
maried; and the kynge Ban toke hir be the hande, and seide,
"Damesell, I moste nede departe at this tyme, but
wher-so-euer I be I am youre knyght as trewly as eny man may be,
and I praye yow haue in mynde to kepe youre body, ffor ye
be conceyved with a sone, and that I do yow verily to wite of
whom ye shull haue ioye and honour;" and of this Merlin
hadde do hym to vndirstonde that knewe a partye of thinges
that were to come; and the damesell ansuerde in baas voyce
sore syghinge, and seide, "Sir, yef it so be god to his pleiser
sende me more ioye ther-of than I haue of youre departinge,
ffor neuer here be-forn was love so soone departed, and seth
yow be-hove nede for to go, I shall conforte my-self the beste

me grace that I be a gladde moder, ffor yef I lyve so longe that
I may it se, hit shall be to me a myrour and confort in

armes, and with sighinge comaunded hir to god; and the
damesell returned to hir chamber with the maydenes   <MILESTONE N="217b" UNIT="folio"/>and
the two kynges; and Merlin comaunded the lady to god, and
thanked hir for the grete curtesie and chere that thei hadde
founden; and after thei toke theire horse and departed oute

Agrauadain hem conveyed to the pyne tre, and than returned;
and the two kynges rode forth to the see, and founden shippes,
and passed ouer; and whan thei were landed thei ride forth
till thei come to Benoyk, where thei were resceived with grete
ioye; but a-bove alle other were the two sustres, the Quenes
gladde and ioyfull, and so the two kynges soiourned viij dayes
in Benoyk with theire two wifes, and with hem also Merlin;
and the ix<HI1 REND="sup">the</HI1> day he toke leve of the two kynges and the
Quenes, and of the other barouns, and repeired to Nimiane, his
owne love, that made hym grete chire, and of hym was gladde
and ioyfull, ffor moche she hym loved for the grete debonerte
that she hadde in hym founden, and he loved nothinge so wele
as he dide hir, and wele it shewed, ffor he taught hir that he
wolde not teche to noon other, and so he a-bode with hir viij
dayes, and than departed and com to Blase, his maister, that
so moche desired hym to se; and Merlin hym tolde the assemble
on the playn of Salisbery, and how thei rescewed the Quene of

come and assembled at the comaundement of the kynge Rion,
and he hem saugh alle be-fore hym he made his complaynt
and his clamoure heringe hem alle, and seide to hem full
sympilly, "Lordinges, ye be alle my liege men, and of me

a-venge my shame, nought only myn but alle youres; ffor he
that doth to me shame or vylonye, he doth it not only to me,
but to yow alle in generall, and therfore I pray yow and require
be the oth that ye haue made to me that ye be with-ynne this
two monethes be-fore Torayse a-gein the kynge leodogan of
Carmelide that by his force hath me discounfited and chaced

seide, "Of that it nedeth vs neuer to preyen, for this shall be
don at youre plesier."  With that thei departed and wente
hom in to theire contrey, and made hem redy, and com at the
day that was named with grete force be-fore the castell of
Torayse; and the kynge Rion com with all his peple, and
be-seged town all a-boute, and gadered the prayes in her
comynge.  But Cleodalis the stiward of Carmelide that was a
noble knyght, and a trewe to his lorde chalenged it full fiercely
of the forreyours, ffor he com out with xx<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men that he hadde
with-holden to kepe the marches, and faught with hem fiercely,


<EPB/><PB N="617" ID="pb.617"/>

and rescowed the pray, and brought it in to the Castell and
made shette the yates; and the kynge Rion and his peple logged
a-boute the castell, and sette vp teintes and Pavelons, and
rested the firste nyght, and on the morowe thei assailed the
town and the castell; and the kynge leodogan and Cleodales
cam oute by a posterne that opened a-gein the river, euen
right a-geins the teinte of kynge Solymas that was gon to the
assaute of a yate, and the kynge leodogan drofe thourgh the
teintes and Pavelouns, and with hym Cleodales, and caste
down to the erthe all that vp-right dide stonde, and toke golde
and siluer, and vesselles of golde and other Iuwelles, and
brought in to the town, and in to the Castell by
strengthe.  Than were thei of the hoste full sory and wroth; and the kynge
Rion seide all that sholde nought hem a-vaile, ffor he wolde
neuer departe from the castell till he hadde it taken, and the
kinge leodogan putte in his mercy; and than thei with-drough
hem from the assaute, and so a-bide fyve dayes with-outen
shotte or other dedes, and while that the kynge Rion lay thus
at soiour, hit was tolde how the kynge Arthur hadde
discounfited the saisnes, and chaced hem oute of the londe, and that
at the assumpcion he sholde holde court roiall in the towon of
Cameloth; and whan the kynge Rion herde thus, he seide,
"Now lete hym feesten, ffor as soone as I haue the kynge
leodogan in my bailly, I shall go vpon hym with so moche
peple that he shall it not endure; and neuertheles yef the
kynge Arthur come to me to aske mercy er I come vpon hym
with myn hoste I will haue of hym pite, and suffre hym to
regne, and of me holde his londe."  "Sir," seide his men,
"sende hym a message, and do hym to wite that it were better
to hym to be-come youre man than to be distroied and his
londe waste."  "So will I do," quod the kynge Rion;" and
than he lete write a letter, and it dide ensele with his seell,
and than he cleped to hym a knyght in whom he moche trusted,
and made   <MILESTONE N="219b" UNIT="folio"/>hym for to swere that he sholde take this letter to
kynge Arthur in his owne hande, and he swor that in the

nexte wey toward Camelot, and with hym but a squyer; and
the kynge Rion a-bode stille be-fore Torayse, and comaunded
his peple to armen hem, and to assaile the castell, ffor he hadde
grete dispite that soche a place with so fewe peple sholde a-geins
hym holde day or houre, ffor hym semed he hadde mo knyghtes
in his hoste than ther were men, and women, and childeren in
the town, "and therefore it is grete shame to ley the sege, ffor
we myght haue taken it at oure first comynge by force, and

Guyomar his cosin, and hervy de rivell, and Males le bruns
issed out armed vpon horse of prise couered with still, and
smote a-monge the peple of kynge Rion that by force hadde
take a barbican, and ledde a-wey xv sergauntes that were bolde

Cleodalis smot the kynge Margant with a spere that neither shelde
ne hauberk myght hym a-vaile, for the spere shaft shewed
thourgh his bakke be-hynde, and he blussht down deed to

than be-gan the cry and the noyse, and lefte the assaute, and
Cleodalis and his companye rescowed the xv men, and brought
hem in to the Castell, and closed the yates, and thei of the hoste
also with-drough theire peple, and bar the deed kynge in to the

and he asked of kay that served whiche was the kynge Arthur,
and kay hym shewed a-noon right; and the knyght, that was
wise, and well cowde speke, com be-fore the kynge, and seide
so lowde that alle myght it vndirstonde, "Kynge Arthur,

and whan the kynge this herde he be-gan to smyle, and seide,
"Full sobirly a-vise the of thi message, ffor of all that thow art

thei be-hilde hym for a merveile bothe oon and other, and hem
liked more the melodye of this harpour than eny thinge that
this other mynstralles diden; and the kynge Arthur hadde grete
merveile fro whens this man myght come, and yet he ought
hym well to knowe, for many tymes hadde he hym seyn in
other maner and in othere semblaunces; and whan thei hadde
eten and the clothes were taken up, the harpour com be-fore
the kynge, and seide, "Sir, yef it plese yow graunte me reward
for my servise."  "Certes, frende," seide the kynge, "it is reson,

harpour, "ye shull neuer haue ther-in but honour, yef god
will."  "Than sey youre volunte," seide the kynge boldely.  Than
seide the harpour, "I aske yow, and require to bere youre

merveile; than be-hilde hym the kynge Ban, and remembred hym
of Merlin that in the Castell of the marasse hym served in
disgise of a yonge knyght of xv yere age, and thought it sholde

it sholde be to oure profite and oure honour that a mynstrall
sholde bere oure baner in bateile, whiche may not lede
hymself, though I hit with-sey I do nothinge a-gein right, for it
is a thinge that I sholde not graunte lightly, but I knewe
right well the persone that it sholde bere;" and a-noon as this
worde was seide, the harpoure vanysshed a-monge hem that noon
wiste where he be com.  Than Arthur be-thought hym on
Merlin, and was sory and wroth that he ne hadde it hym graunted,
and alle that were ther-ynne were a-baisshed, for that he was
loste so sodeinly; and the kynge Ban of Benoyk that well
a-parceived it was Merlin seide to the kynge Arthur, "Certes,

as <CORR SIC=" ">he</CORR> that soposed well it was Merlin, "So helpe me god, ye
owe it well to bere, and I it yow graunte."  Gramercy, sir,"
seide the childe, "ffor in me it shall be wele employde;" and
with that he comaunded hem alle to god, and wente oute of
the paleis, and than a-noon he toke his owne semblaunce soche
as he was wonte to haue, and seide to hym-self that now hym
be-hoveth to somown the kynges hoste, and wente toward the
see and passed ouer and com to Gannes, to Pharien, and to
leonces of paierne, and badde hem to assemble theire power of
all that thei myght bringe oute of the londe and come to
Cameloth, and thei seide thei wolde do hys comaundement; and
Merlin com to the see, and passed ouer and wente to the londe
of kynge Vrien, and by the londe of kynge looth, and seid to
the Barouns, and to other princes, that thei be with-ynne xv
dayes afte oure lady day, the Natiuite in September be-fore
Cameloth, and thei hym graunted alle; and than he departed
from them, and com a-gein to the court er euesonge were all
seide vpon the same day of the assumpcion, and the kinge of
hym made grete ioye, and asked why he hadde hym so kept
oute of sight; and he ansuerde that he ought hym wele to

seide how thei were alle somowned bothe at Gannes and at
Benoyk, and thourgh alle the londes of the other barouns; and
the kynge Arthur hym asked whan that was don, and he seide,
"Seth yesterday after mete;" and whan the kynge and the
other princes this vndirstode that he hadde this don, thei hadde
grete wonder, and were ther in ioye and in feste till all here
peple was assembled, and than meved the kynge Arthur and

his baronye, and rode towarde the reame of Carmelide; and
the kynge graunted his baner to Merlin as he hadde promysed
be-fore, and sped theire iournyes till thei come a litill iourney
fro Toraise, where the kynge Rion had be-sege the kynge
leodogan; and whan thei were nygh the hoste, Merlin seide
to Gawein, and to sir Ewein, and to Segramor, "Loke ye
be euer nygh a-boute me;" and thei seide thei wolde don his
pleiser.  "Now than," quod Merlin, "sueth after me softely,
and alle thei of the hoste till we be in bateile, and ye shull
smyte vpon hem of that other partye with-oute rennynge of

so thei wolde with goode will, and so he seide to Arthur and to
alle the othere princes, and wente forth till thei com in to the
hoste of kynge Rion, and Merlin be-fore hem all so harde as his
horse myght renne with the dragon in his hande that caste

and as soone as he saugh hem approche, Sir Gawein hym smote
so, that shelde ne hauberk myght hym warante, but bar hym
thourgh the body deed to the erthe; and than he seide in game,
"He this is sworn to pees, for by hym shall neuer the kynge
Arthur lese acre of his londe ne his beerd be flayn from his
chyn;" with that assembled bothe hostes that oon a-gein that
other, and grete was the noyse, and the fray of the people of kynge
Rion, and of the peple of kynge Arthur; and ther dide Gawein,

on bothe sides; and Merlin that bar the dragon drof in to the
prees, and sir Gawein and his companye after, and smote hem
so harde that thei metten that thei neded no salve, and the
speres fly in peces; and that was a thinge that discounforted
the kynge Rion and his peple, ffor thei wende verily that fendes

chiualrouse that ther-fore thei wolde not be discounfited, but
hilde bateile grete and merveilouse a-gein the peple of kynge
Arthur, and made hem resorte bakke at hir first comynge, and
therfore was sir Gawein and his companye full of dolour; and
Merlin that rode be-fore hem cried, "What lordinges, what
shall this be-mene, be ye now a-rested? sueth me yef ye will

in a-monge hem of Irelonde that well hem resceyued with
trenchaunt wepenes.  But sir Gawein and his companye dide
so well in armes that thei pressed thourgh the peple of kynge
Rion, but first was ther many a hevy stroke yoven and resceived,
and many a knyght straught deed to the erthe; and the kynge
Arthur, and the kynge looth of Orcanye, and the kynge Ban,
and the kynge Bohors were smyte in to the bateile on a-nother

a-gein theire strokes endured noon armure.  But the peple of
kynge Rion mette hem so fiercely, that thei smote down the
kynge looth and the kynge Bohors from theire horse a-mydde

thei lept on foot full vigerousely with theire swerdes drawen,
and be-gonne to smyte down horse and men so crewelly that
ther ne was noon that hem saugh, but he hilde it for a
merveile; and the kynge Arthur and the kynge Ban pressed that
wey hem to remounte, and Merlin com drivinge with the baner
in his hande that thourgh his throte caste fire and flame, and
smote in to the grettest presse; and whan the peple of kynge
Rion saugh the grete merveile of the dragon that so caste fire,
thei hadden grete drede and forsoke place, and the two kynges
on whom thei dide a-bide, and Merlin com to them and
delyvered to euerich of theym a good horse and a swifte, for I-nowe
ther were a-stray thourgh the felde, and thei a-noon lept vpon
horse, and rode in to the bateile, and be-gonne to do so well

grete ioye, and sette hym on a horse, and brought hym in to
the castell of Toraise, and hym vn-armed, and serched his

resceived of hym theire londes, and theire fees, and dide hym
homage, and than returned in to theire contrey, and with hem

lamentacion and wepinge; and the kynge Arthur was at Toraise gladde
and ioyfull of the victorie that godde hym hadde yoven, and
soiourned in the castell till he was warisshed of his woundes

worthy prince."  "So helpe me god," seide the kynge, "ye
haue right, and I shall do all youre volunte."  Than the kynge
toke his right spore of the damesell, and sette it on the right
hele, and the damesell sette on the lifte; and whan the kynge
hadde don on his hauberk vpon the dwerf, the kynge girt hym
with his swerde, ffor the maiden wolde not suffre noon to touche
hym saf only the kynge; and whan he was all appareiled of
all that longeth to a knyght, the kynge yaf hym the a-colee, and
seide, "God make hym a good knyght;" and than the mayden
asked yef he sholde do eny more.  "Damesell," seide the


<EPB/><PB N="638" ID="pb.638"/>

kynge, "I haue don that to me aperteneth."  "Sir," quod
she, "than now pray hym that he be my knyght;" and the
kynge hym preide; and than wente thei oute of the halle, and
com vnder the pyne tre; and the maiden made the dwerf to
lepe vpon his stede that was so feire, and she hir-self henge
the shelde a-boute his nekke that was of soche coloure as ye haue
herde, and than she toke hir mule and than made the two
squyres to take theire horse, and sente hem bothe home in to
theire contrei, and she and hir knyght yede another wey in to
the foreste that was grete and merveilouse; and the kynge
Arthur a-bode stille in his paleis, he and Merlin, and sir Gawein,
and his companye; and I-nough thei lough of the maiden that
so hadde yoven hir love to the duerf.  "Certes," seide the
quene, "I haue grete merveile, fro whens this thought myght
hir be-falle, for so foule a thinge, and so lothly ne saugh I
neuer; and the damesell is full of grete bewte, that in foure
remes sholde not be founden hir pareile, and I trowe verily
that it be som fende or of feire that thus hath hir
disceived."  "Madame," seide Merlin, "she is not disceived, but for the
grete lothlynesse that is in hym; ffor neuer in youre lif saugh
ye so hardy a pece of flesshe as is this duerf, and he is bothe
kynges sone and quenes."  "Sir," seide the quene, "the
damesell semeth well to be of high lynage, for she is right feire,
and hir lief right lothly."  "Madame," quod Merlin, "the
grete bounte of hym shall a-bate the grete lothlynesse that ye
se in hym, and that shall ye knowe hastely more
verily."  "Ffeire frende, Merlin," seide the kynge, "what is the
damesell; know ye   <MILESTONE N="226b" UNIT="folio"/>hir eny thinge?"  "Sir," seide Merlin, "I telle
yow in trouthe that I saugh hir neuer be-fore, and yet I knowe
well what she is, and what is hir name, and that she shall
telle yow hir-self with-ynne short tyme, and so shall she be
better be-leved than sholde I, and by the duerf hym-self shall
ye knowe what he is soner than ye wene, and ther-of shull
ye haue bothe ioye and sorowe."  "Ye," seide the kynge,
"therof I praye yow to telle me the verite."  "Sir," seide
Merlin, "it falleth not at this tyme that I sholde it sey, ffor


<EPB/><PB N="639" ID="pb.639"/>

ye shull right soone haue other weyes to vndirstonde, ffor Luce
the Emperour of Rome hath sent yow his messages, and thei
be at the grees of the halle."</P><P>  And as Merlin spake to the kynge Arthur, ther com vp
xij princes full richely be-seyn, and clothed in riche
clothes of silke, and com two and two holdinge eche other be
the handes, and eche of theym bar a braunche of Olyve in his
hande, and that was a signe that thei were messagiers; and in
this maner thei com be-fore the kynge Arthur that satte at the
high table in the paleis, and his barouns <CORR SIC="hym hym">hym</CORR>   be-forn; and the
messagiers com in and made no salutacion to noon that ther
was, and than spake oon that was maister of hem alle, and
seide, "Kynge Arthur, we be xij princes of Rome that be sente
to the from Luce the Emperour."  Than he drough oute a letter
that was wrapped in a cloth of silke, and straught it to the
kynge, and bad hym do rede the letter, and the kynge toke
the letter and delyuered it to the Archebisshoppe that satte hym
be-side, and comaunded hym to rede, and the archebisshop
be-gan in this maner:</P><P>  "I Luce, Emperour of Rome, that haue the powste, and
the signiourie of the Romayns, sende to myn enmy the
kynge Arthur in-as-moche only as he hath agein me deserued;
and agein the power of rome, and it merveileth me sore,
and I haue ther-of grete disdeyn, that he thourgh his grete
pride leste to a-rise a-gein Rome as longe as he knoweth me on
lyve, and this formednesse is come to the by fole hardynesse,
and of malencolie whan thow durst euer a-rise a-gein Rome that
hath the power and signiourie ouer all the worlde as thou thy-self
hast well seyn and knowen, and yet shalt thou knowe and se
a-pertly that thow hast don as a fooll that Rome durst wrathe,
thou hast trespassed a-gein rightwisnesse whan thow hast
withholde the seruise and the trewage of Rome, and takest oure
rentes and oure londes that thow knowest aperteneth to the
power of Rome; wher-fore dost thou that, or what right


<EPB/><PB N="640" ID="pb.640"/>

hast thou ther-to, wite thow right wele yef thow holde it
longe thow shalt be as wery ther-of as the lambe is of the
wolf, ffor thow art a-gein vs as fooll hardy as the shepe
a-gein the shepherd; ffor Iulius cesar oure auncestre toke it
be force, and by his hardynesse toke bateile in the Breteigne, and
trwys was hym yolden, and so it was of alle the yles ther
a-boute; and thow woldest it vs be-reve thourgh thy folie, and
thi grete pride, and the grete outrage that is in the; and I
the comaunde as Emperour that thow do right, and with-ynne
the day of the holy Natiuite that thow be by-fore vs for to
a-mende that thow hast mysdon; and yef thou wilt not this
do, I shall take from the all Breteigne, and all the londe that
thou hast in bailly, and I shall passe mongin this first somer
with so grete force of peple that thou shalt haue no hardynesse
me to a-bide.  Ne thou shalt not knowe   <MILESTONE N="227a" UNIT="folio"/>whider to fle, but I
shall the sewe, and I shall take the, and bynde and caste the
in my prison."</P><P>  Whan the archebisshoppe hadde redde this letter in this
maner as ye haue herde, in the paleis was grete
murmur and noyse of hem that this hadde vndirstonde, and
swor and seide thei sholde dishonour the messagiers that these
lettres hadde brought, and a-noon thei sholde hem haue don
shame I-nough, but as the kynge seide to hem full debonerly,
"Ffeire lordes, lete hem be, thei be but massengiers, and be
sent by comaundement of theire lorde; and ther-fore thei owe
to sey that thei were with charged, and thei sholde ther-fore
haue no doute of no man."  Than the kynge cleped his princes
and his barouns, and entred in to a chambre to counseile; and
than spake a knyght that was bolde and hardy, and his name
was Cador, and seide that "longe haue we be idill and in slouthe
in deduyt a-monge ladyes and damesels in Iolite and wast;
but on this day we be a-waked by these Romayns that come to
chalenge oure londes an oure contrey; and yef thei do as the
lettres speke thei haue grete prowesse and hardynesse that be
in so fer contreyes."  "Certes," seide Gawein, "full good is it
to haue pees after the werre, for the londe is the bettere and


<EPB/><PB N="641" ID="pb.641"/>

the more sure, and full good is the game and pley a-monge
ladies and maydenes, ffor the druweries of ladies and damesels
make knyghtes to vndirtake the hardynesse of armes that thei
don."  Than the kynge comaunded hem alle to sitte, and thei
dide his comaundement, and he himself a-bode stondinge, and
seide, "My frendes and my felowes in my prosperite, and in
myn honour and traueile that ye haue me mayntened in grete
bateiles, and in werres that I haue hadde seth I com to haue
londe, and yow haue I ledde in many a grete nede bothe be
see and by londe, and ye haue me helped, god quite yow, to
conquere the londes that I haue wonne, that by youre helpinges
beth alle to me obeysaunt, and ye haue herde the maundement
that the Romayns haue sent that I-nough haue vs
contraried.  But yef oure lorde kepe me and yow thei shull nought haue
ours but it be dere bought at the departinge, ye se here the
message of the Emperoure, and ther-fore yeve me counseile in
what manere I may hem ansuere moste auenauntly by honour
and by reson; ffor oon ought to purveye er the stroke falle
ther as is pereile, for he that seeth the arow comynge he ought
to blenche that he be not smyten; ye se how the Romayns
will a-rise a-gein vs, and therfore we ought vs so to appareile
that thei vs not greve ne annoyen.  Thei wolde haue trewage
of Bretaigne, and of other yles that of me beth holdinge; and
sein that Cezar hem conquered by force, and that the Bretouns
ne myght hem not diffende a-geins hem but paide hem trewage,
and force is no right, but it is pride and oute of reson, and he
holdeth not of right that holdeth of force.  Thei haue vs
reproved by the shames and damages that thei haue vs don, and
the traueiles, and the annoyes that thei haue do to oure
  <MILESTONE N="227b" UNIT="folio"/>auncestres, in that thei a-vaunte hem how thei haue hem
venquysshed, and that thei paide hem trewage, and so moche the
more ought we to hate hem and to greve, and the more thei
haue to restore, ffor we moste hate hem that haten vs, and for
thei hadde trewage of hem thei wolde it haue of vs by heritage
and by auncestrie; and by soche reson may we chalenge Rome,
ffor Belyns that was kynge of Breteigne, and Brenne his brother,


<EPB/><PB N="642" ID="pb.642"/>

conquered Rome and henge xiiij of her ostages in sight of her
frendes, and after hem com Constantynus that was kynge of
Bretaigne, and was Emperour of Rome; and also maximian
was lorde of Bretaigne, and was lorde of Rome, alle these were
oure auncestres, and were kynges of Bretouns, and eche of
theym was Emperour and lorde of the Romayns, and therby
may we knowe that I owe to haue Rome by heritage as I
haue Bretaigne.  Romayns haue hadde trewage of vs, and my
parentes haue hadde trewage of theym.  Thei clayme Bretaigne
for theiers, and I clayme Rome for myn; and so this is the
ende of my counseile that he haue the londe, and the rente
that may it gete; ffor in this I se noon other rightwisnesse,
but who that all may gete, all shall haue, ffor as for my part
I will noon other-wise do but as I haue yow seide."</P><P>  Whan the princes and the Barons herde the kynge thus
speke, thei ansuerde with oon voice that he hadde well
seide, and counseiled to sende for his peple fer and nygh, and
assemble all his power, and go a-gein the Emperour of Rome,
that thourgh his grete pride hadde sente outrage of crewelte
and felonye, "and put the signiourie of Rome in youre powste,
and remembre yow of the signiourie and prophesie of Sibile,
that seide ther sholde thre Bretouns come oute of Bretaige that
Rome sholde conquere be force, and ther hath ben tweyne that
Rome hath conquered.  The first was Belyn that was kynge of
Bretouns, and the seconde was Constantinus, and thow shalt be the
thridde that shall it conquere by force, and so shall the prophesie
be fulfilled.  Now a-vaunce yow to resceyve the honoure that
god hath yow ordeyned."  With these wordes the kynge com oute
of the chamber, and the barouns and the knyghtes com in to
the paleis, where as the massagiers that were xij princes were
a-bydinge, and than spake the kynge, and badde hem returne to
theire Emperoure, and telle hym that his ancestres of Bretaige
hadde Rome in her bailly, "and therfore in-as-moche as myn
auncestres dide it conquere, and were ther-of Emperours, and
ther-of hadde trewage, I will hit haue of auncestrie and
heritage, ffor that thei haue not done that thei ought do a-gein

me of right;" and with this ansuere they departed, and the
kynge hem yaf riche yeftes and presentes at theire departinge,
as he that was the moste curteise prince of the worlde, and full
of largesse, and therfore he wolde not that thei sholde speke
eny euell of hym ne vilonye; and thei returned in to theire
contreye as soone as thei myght, and tolde Luce the Emperour
the ansuere of kynge Arthur, and ther-of was the Emperour
wroth and angry, and somowned his peple, and assembled his
power, and passed the mountaynes of mongin, and com in to
Burgoyne nygh a Cite that is cleped Oston, and sesed the londe
in lengthe and brede.  But   <MILESTONE N="228a" UNIT="folio"/>a-while we shull reste of hym,
and speke of the kynge Arthur.</P><P>  Now seith the storie than whan the xij Massagiers were
departed from the kynge Arthur, the kynge and his
baronye a-bide stille full wroth and angry, for the maundement
of Luce the Emperour; and Merlin seide, "Sir, sende for youre
peple hastely, for the Emperour appareileth hym right
faste."  "Merlin, frende," seide the kynge, "I shall mete with hym
sonner than he wolde."  "He shall you mete," seide Merlin,
"to his damage; and a-bide here in ioy, for I go of make the
message to the Barouns."  With that he vanysshed, that Arthur
ne wiste where he be-come; and Merlin wente first in to Orcanye
and dide the message to the kynge looth, that with xv dayes
he sholde be at logres with all his power; and he seide he
wolde so with good will, and than Merlin departed, wher-for
sholde I make yow longe tale, he warned alle the princes and
barons that of the kynge arthur were holdinge to be the xv
day at logres, saf only the kynge Ban of Benoyk, and the kynge
Bohors of Gannes; and after that he returned a-gein, and fonde
the kynge Arthur in his chambre, and seide, "Your message
is don to alle the Barouns, and thei shull be redy her fro hens
xv dayes."  Whan the kynge this vndirstode he was gladde
and ioyfull, and soiourned at logres till his baronye was come,
and thider come the kynge looth first, and his companye with
vj<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and the kynge Vrien with iij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1> men, and the kynge
Carados foure Ml men, and the kynge de Cent Chiualers iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>,

Aguysans iiij<HI1 REND="sup">Ml</HI1>; and whan thei were alle assembled in the
medowes be-fore logres, the kynge Arthur was gladde, and
thanked hem hertely, and tolde hem the outrage that the
Emperour hadde hym sente, and thei hym counseiled to haste
that he were a-venged of the shame.  Than was the navie
appereiled and entred in to shippes; and Merlyn was be-fore,
and stinte neuer till he com to Gannes, and fonde the kynge
Ban and the kynge Bohors, and he badde hem thei sholde hem
appereile, for the kynge Arthur is entred in to the see for to
go vpon the Romayns, and thei seide thei wolde be redy hym
to mete; and Merlin returned and com to the port er the kynge
Arthur were londed, and whan he hym saugh he asked whens
he com; and he seide he hadde ben at Gannes for to somowne
bothe two kynges that shull be redy with yow to mete with
grete companye of peple; of this thanked hym Arthur, and
than thei issed oute of the shippes, and logged a litill from the
port vpon the river in tentes, and in pavilouns for to take theire
reste of traueile that thei hadde in the see, and slept that
nyght; and as the kynge Arthur slepte hym com a vision, that
a grete bere was on a grete mountayne, and as hym semed ther
com a-gein hym a grete dragon from the Clowdes of the orient,
and caste fire and flame thourgh his throte so merveilouse that
all the contrey ther-a-boute ther-of was light, and this dragon
assailed the bere full fiercely, and the bere hym diffended full
wele;   <MILESTONE N="228b" UNIT="folio"/>but the dragon enbraced the bere as hym semed, and
cast hym to the erthe, and hym slough.</P><P>  Whan the kynge a-woke he merveiled sore of his dreme,
and made Merlyn come be-fore hym, and praied hym
dierly to tell hym the significacion of his dreme, and than he
tolde hym all worde for worde to Merlin as he hadde seyn in
slepinge; and than seide Merlin, "Sir, I shall sey you the
<CORR SIC="tokenige">tokeninge</CORR> the bere, the bere that ye saugh signifieth a grete


<EPB/><PB N="645" ID="pb.645"/>

monstre, a grete Geaunt that is here nygh in a mountaigne that
is come oute of the ontrey of spayne in to this londe, and here he
a-bideth, and doth the contrey shame from day to day ne noman
dar hym a-bide for the grete force that is in hym; the dragon
that ye saugh in youre a-vision that caste thourgh his throte
fire and flame so grete that all the londe ther-of was light
signifieth youre-self by the fire of youre hardinesse that is
clier and feire shyninge by grace, and the dragon that assailed
the bere so vigerously signifieth that ye shall assaute the Geaunte,
of that the dragon enbrased hym and caste to the erthe
signifieth that the Geaunte shall enbrace yow, but in the ende ye
shull hym sle, of that be ye nothinge in doute."  With that
<CORR SIC="the">thei</CORR> trussed tentes and pavilons, and ride forth on theire wey,
but thei hadde not longe gon whan tidinges com to the kynge
Arthur of the Geaunte that distroied the londe and the contrey,
so that ther-ynne duelled nother man ne woman, but fledde
thourgh the feldes as bestes disolate for drede of the Geaunte,
and hadde born by force a mayden of the contrey that was
nyece to a lorde of the contrey that was a grete gentilman,
and he hadde born hir with hym vp to a mounteigne,
where-as he repeired that was all closed with the see, and
that monteigne is yet cleped the mounte seint Michel, but
at that tyme ther was nother mynster ne chapell, ne ther
was no man so hardy ne so myghty that durst fight with the
Geaunte; and whan the peple of the contrey dide hym assaile,
thei myght not a-gein hym endure neither on londe ne on se,
for he slough hem with the roches, and made theire shippes to
sinke; and the peple of the contrey fledde thourgh the wodes
and forestes, and mounteynes with theire children in theire
armes, and so thei lefte theire londes and theire richesses.</P><P>  Whan Arthur herde how the Geaunte distroied so the
londe, he cleped kay the stiward, and Bedyuer, and
badde hem make hem redy armed a-boute mydnyght, and thei
dide his comaundement, and com to-geder thei thre and two
squyres only, and no mo, and rode till thei com vpon the
mounte, and saugh a grete fire bright shynynge on that o side;

<EPB/><PB N="646" ID="pb.646"/>

and on that othir side was a-nother mounte that was not so
grete as that, and ther-on was a fire merveilouse grete, and thei
wiste not to whiche thei sholde gon; than he cleped Bediuer,
and bad hym go loke on whiche mounte the Geaunte was.  Than
Bediuer wente in to a bote that was full of the flos of the see,
and whan he was come to the next monteyn he wente vp
hastily on the roche, and herde grete wepinge; and whan he
that herde he hadde doute, ffor he wende the Geaunte hadde
be there, but he toke vpon hym hardynesse, and drough his
swerde, and wente forth and hoped for   <MILESTONE N="229a" UNIT="folio"/>to fight with hym as
he that for no drede of deth ne wolde be founde no cowarde,
and in this thought he clymbed vpon the mountein; and whan
he was come vp he saugh the fier that was clier brennynge, and
saugh a tombe faste by that was newly made, and be-side that
tombe satte an olde woman discheueled, and all to-rente hir
heir, and wepte and sighed full sore; and whan she saugh the
knyght, she seide, "Haa, gentilman, what art thow, what
dolour hath brought the in to this place, ffor with grete dolour
thou shalt ende thy life, yef the Geaunte the finde, ffle hens
hastely as faste as thow maist, for thou art to vn-happy yef thow
a-bide till that this deuell come that hath no pite of nothinge, fle
hens as fer as thou maist, yef thou wilt thi lif saue."</P><P>  Whan Bediuer saugh the woman so wepe, and so pitously
regrated helayn sighinge, and bad hym to fle but
yef he wolde dye, and he seide, "Good woman, lete be thy
wepinge, and telle me what thou art, and why thou makest so
grete sorowe, and why thou art vpon this mounte by this tombe,
and telle me all the occasion of thy sorowe, and who lith here
in this sepulture."  "I am," quod she, "a dolerouse caitif
that wepe and make waymentacion, for a mayden that was
nyece to Hoell of nauntes that I norished and yaf souke with
my mylk, and she lith vnder this tombe, and it was me
comaunded hir to norish and to kepe.  Now is ther a deuell that
hir hath taken a-wey and brought hider her and me, and wolde
haue leyn by the childe that <CORR SIC=" ">was</CORR> yonge and tender.  But she
myght hym not svffre ne endure, for he was moche and hidiouse,

and lothly, and so he made the soule departe from the body, and
thus he be-rafte my doughter falsly and be treson, and ther
I haue hir biried, and for hir wepe bothe day and
nyght."  "And wherfore," quod Bediuer, "gost thou not hens seth thou
art left here a-lone, and hast hir loste seth that ther is noon
recouer."  "Sir," quod she, "I knowe well ther is no recouer,
but for that I se ye be a gentilman, and ther-to so curteise I will kepe nothinge from youre knowinge, but I will telle yow
the trouthe, whan that my dere doughter was entered, for whos
love I wende wele haue loste my witte, and dyed for doel, the
Geaunte made me to a-bide stille to haue his foule lecherouse
lust vpon me, and he hath me diffouled by his strengthe that
I moste suffre his wille whedir I wolde or noon, for I haue
no myght a-gein hym, and I take oure lorde god to recorde
it was neuer my will, and ner ther with he hadde me slain,
ffor with hym haue I suffred grete peyne and gret anguyssh,
ffor he is vn-mesurable grete, and he cometh hider to fulfille
his lecherie vpon me, and thou art but deed, and maist in no

in that mountayn where thou seist that fier, and ther-fore I
pray the go hens thy wey, and lef me here to compleyne, and
make my mone for my doughter."</P><P>  Grete pite hadde Bediuer of the woman, and moche he hir
counforted, and seth he com a-gein to the kynge, and
tolde that he hadde sein, and seide how the geaunte was vpon
the high hill ther he saugh the grete fier and smoke.  Than
the kynge made   <MILESTONE N="229b" UNIT="folio"/>his felowes go with hym vpon the mounteyne,
and thei were come vpon the hill; than the kynge comaunded
his felowes to abide, and seide that hym-self alone wolde go
fight with the Geante, "neuertheles," seide the kynge, "loke
that ye waite well vpon me, and yef it be myster cometh me
to helpe," and thei seide thei wolde with good will, and thei
a-bide; and the kynge wente toward the Geaunte that satte
be-fore the fire, and rosted flessh on a spite, and kut of the side
that moste <CORR SIC=" ">was</CORR> I-nough, and ete it; and the kynge wente
to-ward hym with swerde in honde drawen a softe pas gripinge his

shelde, for he wende hym to haue supprised.  But the Geaunte
that was full false and maliciouse be-helde, and saugh the kynge
come and lept up, ffor the kynge hadde his swerde in his hande,
and the Geaunte stert to a grette clobbe that stode by hym
that was grete and hidiouse of a plante of an oke that was a
grete birthon for a myghty man, and caught it from the fire,
and leide it on his nekke, and com fiercely a-gein the kynge
as he that was of grete force, and seide to the kynge that a
grete fooll was he to come ther, and reised the batte for to
smyte the kynge on the heed, but he was wight and delyuer,
and lept a-side, so that he of hym failed, and ther-with the
kynge smote at hym and wende to smyte hym on tho heed;
but the Geaunte that was bolde and hardy kept it on his clobbe,
or elles hadde he be deed, neuertheles somdel he touched hym
with Marmyadoise his good swerde, that he conquered of the
kynge Rion, and touched hym be-twene the two browes that
he wax all blinde, for the blode that ran ouer his yen, and
that was a thinge that sore hym greved, for he myght not se
where to smyte, and be-gan to scarmyshe and to grope a-boute
hym with his staffe as a wood devell and sore a-baisshed, and
the kynge hasted hym full harde but a-reche hym myght not,
ffor the Geaunte caste a-boute hym grete strokes that yef he
hadde hym smyten he hadde ben all to-brosed, and thus thei
foughten longe, that the oon ne touched not that other, and
therfore thei were sore anoyed; and than the Geaunte wente

after these were come myght the romayns not endure, but turned

repeired toward the bretouns that hadde gadered a-gein alle
the prisoners that thei ledde; and Pharien hem asked what thei

these prisoners sendeth in to ffraunce;" and whan thei
vndirstode this, thei seide thei were welcome.  Than thei wente alle
to-geder to Benoyk, and made the prisoners a-light be-fore the

</P><P>  A-noon with-ynne xv dayes after the kynge Ban, and the
kynge Bohors, and Merlin were departed from the castell
of the marasse, where thei hadde ley in ioye and feste, a riche
man of the contrey com to the castell on a nyght; and the
lorde of the castell, that was a worthy knyght and a wise, made
hym grete chere, and in reuerence of hym made his doughter
to serue of the cuppe as she that was full wise and wele lerned;
and the knyght that ther-in was herberowed be-helde the
damesell that he liked right wele, and requered her of hir fader,
and seide he wolde hir haue to his wif yef it hym liked, and
the fader hym thonked of the honour that he hym profered,
and was ther-of full gladde, for he was the highest lorde of that
contrey, and seide he wolde speke ther-of to his doughter, and
than yeve hym ansuere; whan thei hadde soped, thei yede to
reste, and on the morowe thei a-rise erly, and agrauadain
a-resoned his doughter of that the knyght hym requered, that
was so myghty a lorde, that by hym myght alle his frendes be
a-vaunced and worshiped; and whan the damesell this herde
she ansuerde hir fader debonerly, and seide, "Sir, it is not yet
tyme for me to be maried, for I am yonge, and ther-fore I
be-seche yow speketh not ther-of, but suffre me a-bide yef it
plese yow."  "Ffeire doughter," quod he, "to leve spekinge
herof I se no profite; ye ought to haue grete ioye in youre
herte, for that so high a lorde deyneth to aske yow in   <MILESTONE N="237b" UNIT="folio"/>mariage;
ffor ye be a woman but of lowe lynage a-gein hym, and
ther-for I pray yow and comaunde to do my will."  "Sir," quod
she, "ye may well yet suffre a-while, for be the feith that I owe
to yow that be my fader, I am not yet in will to be maried."
"How so, feire daughter," quod he, "will ye than refuse my
plesier and my volunte."  "Sir," quod she, "I knowe well
youre will is not for to haue me I-loste."  "I-loste," seide he,
"nay, but I-wonne to grete honour."  "Nay, sir," quod she,
"but I-loste; for I sholde neuer haue ioye at myn herte, yef
I were maried to eny other than to hym that I haue my-self
promysed and graunted, and yet I knowe well that I shall
neuer hym haue, but I shall holde me to hym that he hath me

lefte, and he is of higher astate and feirer knight than is this."
"Doughter," seide he, "of whom speke ye; tell me more clerly
youre thought and soche thinge I may of yow heren, that I
shall put this thinge in respite."  "Sir," seide the damesell,
"I shall yow telle, seth that ye will it knowe, and I shall of
no worde make yow lesynge."  Than she tolde hym all in
ordore how it was hir be-falle be-twene hir and <CORR SIC="th">the</CORR> kynge Ban
of Benoyk, and how she was by hym with childe; "
and he
tolde me that I sholde haue a sone by whom all my lynage
shall be a-vaunced; wher-fore I praye yow be not a-boute to
marye me to noon other but to the kynge, ffor be the feith that
I owe to god and to yow, I shall neuer haue other but hym."</P><P>  Whan the fader vndirstode his doughter, he was pensif
and wroth, but chere ne semblaunt durste he noon
make, and ansuerde soberly, "Doughter, seth it is thus, I moste
it suffre, and therfore disconfort yow no-thinge, and I shall go
speke with this lorde, and telle hym youre will and nothinge
myn;" and than he com to the knyght that was in doynge on
his spores, and salued hym curteysly, and seide, "Sir, yef it
plese yow to suffre this two yere, I will do youre volunte;"
and that he seide, for he knewe well he wolde it not graunte
that respite; whan the knyght this vndirstode, he ansuerde
ther-to no worde, but lepe to horse, he and his men, and
departed with-oute leve takinge, and swor that seth he myght
hir not haue with love he wolde hir haue be force, and after
hym sholde haue hir who that wolde; and in this maner he
departed and com in to his contrey and somowned his men, till
he hadde wele viij<HI1 REND="sup">C</HI1> knyghtes, and squyres, and yomen, and
many other sowdiours, and com with an hoste be-fore the
Castell des Maras, and pight his teintes by the pyne tre nygh
the cauchie, and swor his oth that neuer sholde he departe thens
till he hadde hir to his wif; and whan the lorde des Maras
saugh hym-self be-seged, he was full of hevynesse, not for no
drede to be taken by strengthe, ne famyn myght thei not lightly
for all the reme myght hym not take, for I-nough he hadde of
vitaile, for v yere that neuer hym neded to com oute at the

yate; and he hadde ther-ynne xlij knyghtes that were bolde
and hardy in armes, ffor the lorde des Mares was a noble
knyght; and thus thei were be-fore the Castell viij dayes that
neuer was caste ne shotte,   <MILESTONE N="238a" UNIT="folio"/>and the ix<HI1 REND="sup">the.</HI1> day, a-boute the hour
of prime, be-fill that a knyght of the hoste that was cleped
Maudras com to the horn that ther henge, and sette it to his
mouthe, and blewe thries with grete myght, so that the lorde
of the castell it herde clerly; and than a-noon he armed hym
richely, and lepte vpon a stede with shelde be-fore his breste
and a spere in hande, and the yate was hym opened, and he
rode oute a grete raundon all the cauchie towarde the hoste,
and cried with high voice whiche was he that was so hardy
to blowen his horne with-oute his leve, and in euell tyme hadde
he it be-gonne, yef in hym were so moche hardynesse with
hym to Iuste, and Maudras seide that for noon other cause was it
do, "and I shall Iuste be soche couenaunt that he that falleth
shall yelde hym-self taken prisoner with-oute more doynge."
"And I it graunte," seide Agrauadain, "yef youre lorde will
assent that I haue of hym no doute ne encombraunce ne of noon
saf only of yow."  "In feith," quod he, "ye shull haue no
doute of noon other seth ye be come so fer."  Than Agrauadain
com down of the cauchie, and he a Maudras ronne to-geder;
and the knyghtes were renged rounde a-boute to be-holde the
Iustinge, and the two knyghtes mette with so grete raundon,
that the sheldes perced, Maudras brake his spere, and
Agrauadain shof so sore, that he bar hym to grounde so rudely, that
he brake his lifte arme be-twene the hande and the
elbowe.  Than he straught oute his hand and hente the horse by the
reyne, and sette hym on the cauchie; and than he seide to
Maudras that he sholde hym sewe and holde his couenaunt,
and than he rode forth towarde the Castell, and drof Maudras
horse hym be-fore, and entred in at the yate where he was
resceyved with ioye; and leriador and his knyghtes com to
Maudras, and fonde hym on swowne, and thei wende he hadde
be deed.  And in a while after he yaf a grete sigh, and opened
his iyen, and comaunded that oon sholde bringe hym to the

castell to a-quyte hym of his oth.  Than leriador lete make a
beere of smale bowes on horsbak, and leide hym ther-ynne,
and couered with a riche cloth of silke and henge this litter
be-twene two horse, and sente hym to the castell.  And
Agrauadain hym resceived, and lete put hym in a feire chambre
where is arme was well dight with salues and
oynementes.  And thei that brought hym thider returned a-gein, and fonde
leriador sori and wroth, and so were all the other.</P><P>  On the morowe com a-nother knyght, and blewe the horne;
and agrauadain com and Iusted with hym, and smote
hym down, and toke his feith to be prisoner, and wente with
hym to the castell, and thus Agrauadain wan xj, and therfore
was the lorde sory and angry; and the xij<HI1 REND="sup">the.</HI1> day he blewe the
horne hym-self; and whan Agrauadain was come as he was
wonte to do, than seide Leriador that at this Iustinge sholde be
fynysshed the werre, and the sege departe; ffor yef Agrauadain
hym conquered, he wolde returne a-gein in to his contrey with
all his hoste.  Ne neuer he ne noon of his sholde touche
nothinge of his, "and yef I yow conquere ye shull me yeve youre
doughter to be my wif, for I aske yow no more."  This was
graunted on bothe parties.  And than wente the two knyghtes
to-geder, and mette with grete raundon on the sheldes a-bove
the bokeles   <MILESTONE N="238b" UNIT="folio"/>that thei perced and rente the hauberkes, that the

sheldes, that eche bar other to grounde, bothe horse and man,
that bothe were sore astonyed, and lay longe while at the erthe;
but bothe thei lept vpon foot, and drough theire suerdes and
smote grete strokes at discouert, and made grete woundes and
merveilouse, and bothe waxen feble for the blode that thei
bledde; but in the ende leriador be-hoved to come to mercy,
and departed from the sege, and wente hom to his contrie; and
Agrauadain returned to his castell, and leide salue to his
woundes, and sente the prisoners in to her contreyes; and he
a-bode gladde and myrye till his doughter was delyuered of a
sone, that after was of grete renoun in the reame of logres, and

in many other contreyes, and was cleped by his right name
Estor; and of hym hadde Agrauadain grete ioye, and made hym
be norisshed in his chambre, and delyuered hym thre norices;
and the damesell hir-self yaf hym sowke of hir owne mylke,
ffor ther was nothinge that she loved so moche, ffor he was so
like the kynge Ban as he hadde be portreyed.  But now shull
we cesse of hym a-while, and of his moder, and of Agrauadain,
that helde hym dere, and returne to speke of the kynge fflualis
that longe hath be stille.</P><P>  Now whan that Merlin was departed from the kynge fflualis,
to whom he hadde tolde his a-vision; and the kynge
fflualis a-bood sore dismayed of that Merlin hadde seide, and
in short tyme after be-fill like as he hadde tolde, for he saugh
his children in the temple of diane I-slayn, and the temple
caste down and dispoiled, and his londe distroied, and his paleys
brente, and hym-self taken and his wif; but thei that hym
toke ne slough hym not, but shewed hem the poyntes of the
cristin feith, and made hem so to vndirstonde fro day to day,
that thei were baptised and waisshe fro the filthe of synne of
mysbeleve, and was cleped be the same name that he hadde
be-fore, and that was fflualis; but the ladies name was chaunged,
and cleped hir misiane, and hir name was be-fore cleped
Lumble; and after were thei longe to-geder till thei hadde
foure doughtres, that after hadde foure princes that were
cristin, and were full good peple and trewe, and hadde many
children; ffor the elthest hadde x sones, that were alle good
knyghtes by the kynge fflualis lif, and viij doughteres; and the
seconde hadde xij sones and thre doughtres; and the thridde

the kynge was lyvinge, and the quene Misiane, that ther-of
hadde grete ioye and gladnesse, and thonked our lorde.  Whan
the kynge fflualis and the foure princes saugh that thei hadde

thei hadde made alle paynyms cristin, and obbeye the lawes of

thourgh paynym londes, and toke townes, and slough
many a paynym, and conquered the londes of the straunge
contreyes, and passed   <MILESTONE N="239a" UNIT="folio"/>in to Galys, and in to Spayne, so that
nothinge myght a-gein hem endure, till that the kynge fflualis
was deed in spayne, and ther-fore were the foure princes full
dolent and the nevewes, and was biried in a Cite that tho was
cleped Nadres; and than thei repeired towarde the parties of
Ieshuralem, and set the londes in her handes, and after departed
by diuerse londes, and hem conquered and toke the honours,
that oon hilde Costantynnoble; and that other greece, where he
hadde foure regiouns; and the thridde hilde barbarie; and the

serve the kynge Arthur, for the grete renoome that of hym was
thourgh the worlde, and with hem com foure knightes that
were bolde and hardy in armes, but litill tyme thei lyved, and
that was grete harme to all cristin peple, ffor thei were noble
and trewe, and the tweyne were deed in a bateile that launcelot
made a-gein the kynge Claudas; and the thridde in a bateile
that the kynge Arthur made a-gein Mordred as shall be rehersed
here-after.  But now shull we returne to speke of the kynge
Arthur.</P><P>  In this partie, seith the storie, that whan the kynge
Arthur and his companye had disconfited the romayns,
and the kynge hadde slayn the catte, thei returned and rode
till thei com to the castell that the kynge hadde fortefied vpon
the river of Aube, and were there viij dayes; and after thei
departed and rode forth till thei com to Benoyk, ffor it was
tolde hem that there were the prisoners, and Pharien and
Cleodalis hem resceyved with grete ioye; and after thei tolden
how thei hadde rescowed theire peple, and the Prisoners and
all thinge as it was fallen, and how thei of the castell wolde

haue taken hem be force.  "Be my feith," seide the kynge,
"in euell tyme thei it be-gonne, for dere shall it be bought."
Than the kynge cleped sir Gawein, and bad hym go to the
castell that was cleped the marche, and throwe it down to the
grounde, so that thei of other contreyes be not so hardy eny
more to encombre me ne noon of myn, and sir Gawein made

sholde neuer be a-gein the kynge Ban, ne the kynge Bohors; and
so made he hem swere that were of Rome that thei sholde neuer
be a-gein the reame of logres; and whan thei were thus sworn,
he sente hem a-gein in to theire contrey, and soiourned all that
day, and on the morowe with the kynge Ban with grete ioye
and grete feeste.  With that com a messagere to the kynge
Arthur that brought tidinges that the kynge leodogan of
Carmelide was deed, and that was the cause he departed so soone
fro the kynge Ban.  On the morowe the kynge Arthur departed
fro the two kynges that were brethern, and after that tyme he
saugh hem neuer more; and that was grete scade that thei
sholde die so soone, as the storie shall declare whan tyme cometh.</P><P>  Whan the kynge Arthur was departed fro the two kynges
that were brethern, that so moche honour hadde hym
don, he traueiled so by his iourneyes that he com to the see
and entred in to shippes, and passed ouer and landed at the
port of Dover, and lepe on their horse and ride forth to logres,
and ther thei fonde the Quene Gonnore, that hem resceived with
grete ioye, and tolde how hir fader was passed oute of this
worlde, and he hir counforted in the beste wise he myght; and
after the kynge departed his peple and thei yode hom in to
theire contreyes, and the kynge Arthur a-boode at logres, and
sir Gawein and the knyghtes of the rounde table, and Merlin
soiourned ther longe tyme.  Than he hadde grete talent for to
se Blase his maister, for to telle hym of all that was be-fallen
seth he fro hym departed; and fro thens he wolde go to Nimiane
his love, for the terme drough faste on that was sette; and he
wente to the kynge and seide that hym be-hoved to go; and
the kynge and the quene prayed hym right entierly soone for
to come a-gein, for he dide hem grete solas and counfort of his
companye, ffor the kynge hym <CORR SIC="love">loved</CORR> feithfully; for in many
a nede he hadde hym socoured and
 holpen, ffor by hym and by
his counseile was he kynge; and he seide to hym right tenderly,
"Dere frende Merlin, seth ye will go, I dar yow not with-holde
a-gein youre wille a volunte; but I shall neuer be in hertes

ese till that I may se yow, and therefore I pray you for the
love of oure lorde haste you soone to come a-gein."  "Sir,"
seide Merlin, "this is the laste time, and ther-fore to god I you
comaunde."  Whan the kynge herde how he seide it was the
laste tyme that he sholde hym se, he was sore a-baisshed; and
Merlin departed with-oute moo wordes sore wepinge, and
trauailed till he come to Blase his maister, that grete chere hym
made, and asked how he hadde sped sethen, and he seide wele;
and than he tolde him alle thinges as thei were be-falle of the
kynge Arthur and of the Geaunte that he hadde slayn; and of
the bateile of the Romains; and how he hadde slain the cat;
and tolde hym also of the litill duerfe how the damesell hadde
hym brought to court, and how the kynge hadde made hym
knyght.  "But thus   <MILESTONE N="240a" UNIT="folio"/>moche," seide Merlin, "I shall telle yow,
he is a grete gentilman, and is no duerf by nature, but thus hath
a damesell hym myshapen whan he was xiij yere of age, for
that he wolde not graunte hir his love, and he was than the
feirest creature of the worlde; and for the sorowe that the
damesell hadde a-raied she hym in soche wise that now is the
lothliest creature and of moste dispite; and fro hens ix wikes
shall cesse the terme that the damesell sette, and shall come in
to the age that he ought for to be, for at that day shall he be
xxij yere olde."  Whan Merlin hadde all thinges rehersed,
and Blase hadde hem alle writen oon after a-nother in ordre,
and by his boke haue we the knowinge ther-of; and whan
Merlin hadde be ther viij dayes he toke leve of Blase, and seide,
"This is the laste tyme that I shall speke with yow eny more,
ffor fro hens-forth I shall soiourne with my love, ne neuer
shall I haue power hir for to leve ne to come ne go."</P><P>  Whan Blase vndirstode Merlin, he was full of sorowe, and
seide, "Dere frende, seth it is so that ye may not
departe cometh not ther."  "Me be-houeth for to go," qoud
Merlin, "for so haue I made hir couenaunt, and also I am so
supprised with hir love, that I may me not with-drawen; and
I haue her taught and lerned all the witte and connynge that
she can, and yet shall she lerne more, for I may not hir with-sein

ne it disturue." Than departed Merlin from Blase, and
in litill space com to his love, that grete ioye of hym made
and he of hir, and dwelled to-geder longe tyme; and euer she
enquered of his craftes, and he hir taught and lerned so moche
that after he was holden a fooll and yet is, and she hem well
vndirstode and put hem in writinge, as she that was well expert
in the vij artes.  Whan that he hadde hir taught all that she
cowde aske, she be-thought hir how she myght hym with-holde
for euer more; than be-gan she to glose Merlin more than euer
she hadde do euer be-forn, and seide, "Sir, yet can I not oon
thinge that I wolde fain lerne, and ther-fore I pray you that
ye wolde me enforme;" and Merlin that well knewe her entent,
seid, "Madame, what thinge is that?"  "Sir," qoud she, "I
wolde fain lerne how I myght oon shet in a tour with-outen
walles, or with-oute eny closure be enchauntement, so that
neuer he sholden go oute with-outen my licence;" and whan
Merlin it herde he bowed down the heed and be-gan to sigh,
and she it a-parceived, she asked whi he sighed.  "Madame,"
seide Merlin, "I shall telle yow; I knowe well what ye thinke,
and that ye will me with-holde, and I am so supprised with
love that me be-houeth to do youre plesier;" and than she caste
hir armes a-boute his nekke and hym kiste, and seide, "that
wele he ought to be hirs seth that she was all his; ye knowe
wele that the grete love that I haue to you hath made me
forsake alle other for to haue yow in myn armes nyght and
day, and ye be my thought and my desire, for with-oute yow
haue I neither ioye ne welthe.  In you haue I sette all my
hope, and I a-bide noon other ioye but of yow, and seth that
I love you, and also ye love me, is not right than that ye do
my volunte and I yours."  "Certes, yesse," seide Merlin, "now
sey than what ye will."  "I will," qoud she, "ye teche me
a place feire and couenable, that I myght enclose by art in
  <MILESTONE N="240b" UNIT="folio"/>soche wise that neuer myght be vn-don, and we shull be
ther, ye and I in ioye and disporte whan that yow

qoud she, "I will not that ye it make, but lerne it to me that

I may it do, and I shall make it than more at my
volunte."  "Well," seide Merlin, "I will do youre plesire."  Than he
be-gan to devise the crafte vnto hir, and she it wrote all that
he seide; and whan hadde alle devised, the damesell hadde
grete ioye in herte, and he hir loved more and more, and she
shewed hym feirer chere than be-forn; and so thei soiourned
to-geder longe tyme, till it fill on a day that thei wente thourgh
the foreste hande in hande, devisinge and disportinge, and this
was in the foreste of brochelonde, and fonde a bussh that was
feire and high of white hawthorne full of floures, and ther thei
satte in the shadowe; and Merlin leide his heed in the damesels
lappe, and she be-gan to taste softly till he fill on slepe; and
whan she felt that he was on slepe she a-roos softly, and made a
cerne with hir wymple all a-boute the bussh and all a-boute Merlin,
and be-gan hir enchauntementz soche as Merlin hadde hir taught,
and made the cerne ix tymes, and ix tymes hir
enchauntementes; and after that she wente and satte down by hym and
leide his heed in hir lappe, and hilde hym ther till he dide
a-wake; and than he loked a-boute hym, and hym semed he
was in the feirest tour of the worlde, and the moste stronge,
and fonde hym leide in the feirest place that euer he lay be-forn;
and than he seide to the damesell, "Lady, thou hast me
disceived, but yef ye will a-bide with me, for noon but ye may
vn-do this enchauntementes; and she seide, "Feire swete
frende, I shall often tymes go oute, and ye shull haue me in
youre armes, and I yow; and fro hens-forth shull ye do alle youre
plesier;" and she hym hilde wele couenaunt, ffor fewe hours
ther were of the nyght ne of the day but she was with
hym.  Ne neuer after com Merlin oute of that fortresse that she hadde
hym in sette; but she wente in and oute whan she wolde.  But
now moste we reste a-while of Merlin and his love, and
speke of the kynge Arthur.</P><P>  The same hour that Merlin was departed fro the kynge
Arthur, and that he hadde seide how it was the laste
tyme that he sholde hym se; the kynge a-boode sore a-baisshed
and full pensif of that worde, and in soche maner he a-boode

<EPB/><PB N="682" ID="pb.682"/>

after Merlin vij wikes and more; but whan he saugh that he
com nought he was full pensif and full of hevynesse, aud on a
day sir Gawein asked what hym eiled.  "Certes nevew," seide
the kynge, "I thinke on that I trowe I haue loste Merlin, and
that he will neuer more come to me, ffor now hath he a-biden
lenger than he was wonte, and gretly I am dismayed of the
worde that he seide whan he fro me departed, ffor he seide this
is the last tyme, therfore I am in doute that he sey soth, ffor
he ne made neuer lesinge of nothinge that he seide, ffor so
helpe me god I hadde leuer lese the Cite of logres than hym,
and ther-fore fain wolde I wite yef eny myght hym finde fer
or nygh, and ther-fore I pray you as derely as ye me love that
ye hym seche till ye knowe the verite."  "Sir," seide Gawein,
"I am all redy to do youre volunte, and a-noon ye shull se
me meve fordwarde, and I suere to you be the oth that I made
to you whan ye made me   <MILESTONE N="241a" UNIT="folio"/>knyght, that I shall seche hym a
yere and a day, but with-ynne that space I may knowe trewe
tidinges."  In this same wise swor sir Ewein, and Segramor,
and Agrauain, and Geheret, and Gaheries, and xxv of her
felowes, and that oon was Doo of Cardoell, and Sacren of the
streite Marche, and Taulus le rous, and Blioc de Cassell, and
Caues de lille, and Amadas de la Crespe, and placidas li gais,

lorfenyns, and Grires de lamball, and kehedins li bens, and
Caros de la broche, and Segurades de la forest perilouse, and
Purades de Carmelide, and Carmeduk the blake; alle these swor
the same oth with sir Gawein, and departed fro the Cite of
logres alle to-geder by the volunte of kynge Arthur, and
wente alle in the quest for Merlin; and whan thei were oute
of the Cite thei departed alle at a crosse that thei fonde at
the entre of a foreste where ther mette thre weyes, and ther
thei departed in thre parties.  But of hem shull we reste
a-while, and speke of the damesell that ledde a-wey the duerf
knyght.</P><P>  Whan kynge Arthur hadde a-dubbed the duerf by the
preier and request of the damesell, and she hadde hym


<EPB/><PB N="683" ID="pb.683"/>

ledde as ye haue herde <CORR SIC="gradde">gladde</CORR>   and ioyfull, and returned to hir
contrey, and rode so the firste day till it was nygh the nyght;
and than thei com oute of the foreste and entred in to a feire
launde that was grete and large; and than the damesell loked
be-fore hir and saugh comynge a knyght armed vpon a stede,
and she shewde hym the duerf; and he ansuerde, "Damesell,
dismaye yow nought but ride forth boldly, for ye shull haue
no drede of hym."  "Sir, he will me bere a-wey be force, and
he cometh hider for noon other cause;" and the duerf ansuerde
a-gein, "Damesell, ride forth suerly, and beth not a-ferde;" and
the knyght hym ascried with lowde voys, "Welcome be my
damesell and my love, ffor now haue I founde that I haue longe
sought."  And the duerf that well hym vndirstode, seide
debonerly, "Sir, be not to hasty, for ye may desire hir to moche at
the be-gynnynge, ffor yet ye haue hir not in youre bailly,
wherfore ye sholde make so grete ioye."  "I owe well to make
ioye," quod the knyght; "for I am of hir sure I-nough, ffor
though I haue hir not, yet I shall right soone;" and euer he
com on as faste as he myght ride; and whan the duerf saugh
hym com so faste, he caste his spere in fewtre, and couered hym
with his shelde that nothinge apered saf the shelde only, and
smote the horse with the spores on bothe sides faste by the
skirtes of his sadell, for his legges were so shorte, and the
horse hym bar with so grete raundon that it semed as he hadde
flowen, and cried to the knyght that he sholde hym diffende;
and he that was full fierce and prowde hadde shame to iuste
with so litill a wrecche, and lifte vp his spere, and seide, yef
god will, with soche a disfigure worme sholde he neuer Iuste,
and hilde his spere vp-right, but neuertheles he couered hym
with his shelde; and the duerf hym smote so harde, that he
perced shelde and hauberk, that the spere passed by the side
and hurtled so harde with his shelde, and with the grete myght
of his horse, that to grounde goth the knyght horse and man,
and in the fallinge his sholdre spronge oute of ioynte, and the


<EPB/><PB N="684" ID="pb.684"/>

duerf rode ouer his body and hym all to-brosed, so that the
knyght swowned for anguyssh   <MILESTONE N="241b" UNIT="folio"/>that be felte; and whan the
duerf that saugh, he cleped the damesell, and prayed hir to take
hym down, and she toke hym in hir armes, and helped hym
down of his horse, and he drough his swerde and ran to the
knyght and vn-laced his helme, and manaced hym to smyten
of his deed, but he wolde hym yelde vtterly; and the knyght
that was hurt saugh the suerde that he hilde ouer his heed, and
hadde drede of deth, and cride "mercy," and put hym in his
wille of all thinge.  "Than," quod the duerf, "shalt thow go,
yelde the to the Prison of kynge Arthur, and sey hym that the
litill knyght that he dubbed hath sent the to be his prisoner,
and that thou shalt put the only in his mercy;" and the knyght
ensured hym his feith to do in this maner.  Than he badde
hym go to his horse, and he seide he hadde ther-to no power,
for his sholdre bon was oute of Ioynte; "but here I moste
a-bide," quod he, "till I fynde oon that me may beren, but
ye shull go take youre horse and ride to the ende of this launde
in a valey where ye shull finde a place of myn, ffor it is tyme
for you to herberowe, and a-bide ye ther stille, and sende some
of my men that may bere me thider, and haue ye no doute of
nothinge."  And the duerf hym graunted, and com towarde
the Damesell that hilde his stede, and she stouped ouer the
nekke of hir palfrey, and caught hym by the armes, and drough
hym vp with grete peyne till that he myght nyghe his sadell;
and than turned toward the knyghtes recete, and a-geins hem
com vj squyres that were ther-ynne, and toke hym down, and
the damesell and hym vn-armed, and dide hym on a mantell
full riche, and the duerf hem seide how hir lorde was hurt,
and thei toke a biere and brought hym a-gein to his recete,
and hym vn-armed, and sente after leches, and dight hym softly
in the beste wise thei cowden; and after thei asked who hadde
hym thus araied; and he sede a knyght that he nothinge knewe,
ne he durste not sey for shame that the duerf hadde it don;
and than he made his hoste the beste chere that he myght, and
made hem richely be serued at ese in a feire chambre


<EPB/><PB N="685" ID="pb.685"/>

where-ynne were two riche beddes, and ther thei slepte till on the
morowe that thei a-rise and made hem redy, and the maiden
armed hir duerf, for she hym loved feithfully, and wolde not
suffre noon to sette on hym eny hande but hir-self; and whan
she hadde hym armed, and a-pareiled saf only of his helme, she
toke hym by the hande and ledde hym in to a chambre ther the
lorde of the place lay, and bad hym good morowe; and he hem
salued right curteisly, and thei be-taught hym to god, and
thanked hym of the honour that he hadde hem don.  Than
wente thei oute of the chambre, and the mayden laced on his
helme, and helped hym on his horse, and delyuered hym his
spere and his shelde; and than the squyres brought the mayden
hir palfrey, and sette hir ther-on; than thei departed fro thens
and toke the wey toward Eastrangore; and the knyght that was
hurt thought to a-quyte hym of his feith, and lete make an
horse litere full riche, and hadde with-ynne a feire bedde, and
the liter couered with a riche cloth of silke, and the knyght
was leide with-ynne; and the liter leide vpon two palfreyes
softe amblinge, and toke the wey streight to Cardoell in walis
where the kynge and the quene soiourned with grete companye
  <MILESTONE N="242a" UNIT="folio"/>of peple; and the kynge satte at dyner in the halle, and the
knyght made hym to be born in to the halle be-fore the kynge,
and seide, "Sir kynge, for to a-quyte me my feith and my
graunte I am I-come to put me in thi prison, and in thy
mercy, as he that is full sore a-shamed of the lothlyest creature
of this worlde, that by his armes me hath conquered;" and
whan he hadde seide thus, he badde his squyers bere hym thens;
and than seide the kynge, "Sir knyght, what is this, thou
seidest thou were come to my prison and my mercy."  "Ye
sir," seide the knyght.  "Than I requyre," quod the kynge,
"that ye as a prisoner you mayntene, and that ye telle me in
whos be-halue ye yelde yow take, and how that ye were
conquered."  "Sir," seide the knyght, "I se well I moste telle
my grete shame and myn annoye, and I shall telle it you seth
I am come ther-to for to parforme youre will and my feith for
to a-quiten.  This is the trouthe that I haue loved a damesell


<EPB/><PB N="686" ID="pb.686"/>

of grete bewte, and kynges doughter, and yef ye will knowe
her name it is the feire beaune the doughter of knyge Clamedien
that is riche and puyssaunt, but neuer myght I bringe hir
therto nother for prayer, ne for love, ne for chiualrie, that I
myght do for hir, she ne wolde neuer graunte me hir love, and
I wolde gladly haue hadde hir to my wif, and hir fader wolde
it well also, and ther-of was gladde, for I am kynges sone and
quenes, but she euer for-soke me for the moste vile and lothsom
creature of the worlde, and fill me so that I rode this other
day thourgh a launde all alone I-armed, and mette my
damesell that repeired from youre contre, and hir dide condite the
duerf knyght to whom she is love; and whan I saugh hir
come with so small condite I was right gladde, and thanked
god that thider hir hadde sente, and I wende to haue hir ledde
awey with-oute more with-seyinge.  But the duerf seide that
I come to sone, and that it was folye for me so sore to haste,
for it sholde go all othere wise than I wende, ffor I trowed to
haue my desire with-oute diffence; and ther-fore I seide my
volunte was well a-complisshed, and I rode faste a-gein the
damesell hir to haue taken, and haue ledde hir with me to a
place of myne that was not fer thens; and whan the duerf
knyght saugh me so be-fore he leide his spere in fewtre, and
I wolde no Iuste with hym with my spere, for me thought
it shame and dispite to Iuste with soche a creature, and
ther-fore I wolde not smyte, and he bar me so rudely to grounde,
that in the fall my lifte sholdre yede oute of Ioynte that I
swowned for anguyssh; and he vn-laced myn helme and wolde
haue smyten of myn heed, but yef I hadde hym assured to
yelde me to youre prison, and ther-fore I do me in youre grace."
"Trewly, frende," seide the kynge, "in good prison hath he
you sette that to me hath you sente, ffor I clayme yow quyte;
but ye shall telle me youre name."  "Sir," quod he, "my
name is Tradilyuaunt, and am the kynges godsone of North
walis, that for grete cherite yaf me his name;" with that his
squyres toke hym vp, and bar hym oute of the paleise, and
leyde hym on two palfreyes, and ledde hym a-gein in to his

contrei; and the kynge Arthur and his barouns spake I-nough
of the duerf, and of the damesell, and seide it were grete ioye
yef the duerf myght come a-gein in to his bewte; and   <MILESTONE N="242b" UNIT="folio"/>preyse
the damesell that in no myschef wolde forsake hir love for no
lothlynesse.  But now at thys tyme cesseth of hem, and
returneth to speke of Segramor that wente in to the quest of
Merlin, and with hym ix knyghtes full profitable bolde and
hardy.</P><P>  Whan Segramor was departed fro sir Gawein, he ledde
with hym ix of his felowes of the same enquest, and
rode till the sonne was go to reste; and than of a-uenture thei
loked at the comynge of the foreste at the issue of a roche, and
saugh a celle where-ynne woned an hermyte, and that wey thei
turned ther for to be herberowed, and thei knokked at the yate,
and the hermyte it opened a-noon and herberowed hem that
nyght as wele as he cowde; and on the morowe erly he seide
masse; and than thei departed fro thens, and com to the
entringe of a foreste, and than seide Segramor to his felowes
that thei sholde departe thourgh the foreste, and so thei diden;
and so that oon wente here and a-nother there, as a-uenture hem
ledde, and in that quest be-fill many feire a-uentures wher-of
this storie maketh no mencion, but so thei yede vp and down by
diuerse contrees that thei performed that enquest that neuer
cowde thei lerne no tidinges of that thei were meved for to
seche; and at the yeres ende thei com a-gein and tolde theire
a-uentures, and some ther were that tolde more theire shame
than theire honoure, but trouthe moste thei sey by theire oth
that thei hadden sworn; and in tho dayes gentilmen were so
trewe, that thei wolde rather lese theire lif than be for-sworn;
and now shull we speke of Ewein.</P><P>  Whan Ewein and his felowes were departed fro Gawein,
he rode till he com to the issue of a foreste, and ther
thei mette a damesell that rode vpon a mule, and made the moste
sorowe of the worlde, and rente hir heer, and cried lowde,
"Alas, where shall I be-come whan I haue loste hym that I
haue loved so wele, and he me.  And for the love of me hath


<EPB/><PB N="688" ID="pb.688"/>

he loste the grete bewte that was in hym;" and whan sir
Ewein this herde, he hadde ther-of grete pite, and com hir
a-geins and asked why she made soche sorowe; and she
ansuerde, "Gentill knyght, haue pite of me and of my love, that
v knyghtes sle in this valey be-nethe this hill."  "Who is
youre love, damesell," quod sir Ewein.  "Sir," qoud she, "it
is Audain the duerf, the sone of kynge Brangore."  "Now
let be youre doell," seide sir Ewein, "for by the feith that I
owe to you he shall noon harme haue, yef I may come be-tyme."
"Sir, gramercy," seide the damesell; "but ye moste you
hasten."  Than sir Ewein rode that wey as the maiden hym
taught as faste as his horse myght renne; and the damesell hym
sewed as moche as she myght, for her mule wente werily, and
sir Ewein hath so riden that he saugh the duerf that vigerously
faught with two knyghtes, and saugh thre ly in myddell of the
feilde that hadde no power to a-rise; ffor that oon was smyte
with a spere thourgh the sholdre, that al was disseuered fro the
body, and that other was smyte with a suerde down to the teth;
and the other tweyne were full feble, and hadde grete doute of
theire deth, for the duerf sought on hem vigerously; and whan
sir Ewein saugh hym thus contene, he shewed to his felowes,
and seide   <MILESTONE N="243a" UNIT="folio"/>that it was grete harme of the duerf that was so
mysshapen, "for he is bolde and hardy, and of grete herte."
"Certes, sir," seide oon of his companye, "neuer no man of
his stature dide soche prowesse, but for goddes sake departe
hem that thei no myscheve, for that were pite, yef hym
myshappe." "Ye sey trouthe," quod sir Ewein; and than he
priked thider.  But er he com he hadde leyde oon to grounde,
and rode ouer his body thre tymes, that nygh he hadde hym
slayn; whan the fifte saugh he was a-lone, he hadde drede
of hym-self, and be-gan to blenche, and wolde haue fledde, and
with-oute faile he was wounded in thre places right depe; but
the duerf that richely was horsed hilde hym so straite, and so
hym hasted, that deed he hadde I-be ne hadde sir Ewein come
the soner, and seide, "Feire, sir, ne do no more, but lete hym
be for curtesie, for we se well how it is, and I-nough haue ye


<EPB/><PB N="689" ID="pb.689"/>

don;" and whan the duerf herde how he hym required so
curteisly, he ansuerde as he that was curteise and
deboneir.  "Sir, pleseth it you that I cesse thus."  "Ye," seide Ewein,
"and ther-of I thanke you, for we se well how it is."  "And
I shall do youre request," seide the duerf, "for ye seme well
to be a worthy man;" with that com the <CORR SIC="knyghtes">knyght</CORR>   that had
foughten with the duerf to sir Ewein, and seide, "Sir, gramercy,
for ye haue saued me fro deth by youre comynge, and blissed
be that lorde that hider you hath brought."  Than he dide
yelde his suerde to the duerf, and the duerf hit resceived; and
in the same wise dide the tother that were lefte on lyve, and
he hem sente in to the prison of kynge Arthur, and sir Ewein
and his companye departed fro the duerf and fro the damesell,
and spredde a-brode thourgh diuerse contrees, and sought Merlin
vp and down, but neuer myght thei here of hym tidinges, and
ther-fore were thei sory and wroth, and repeired to court at the
yeres ende, and eche of hem tolde his auenture that was hym
be-falle in his quest, but the kynge Arthur made all to be
writen.  But now cesseth of the kynge, and of alle the other
companye, and returne to sir Gawein.</P><P>  Whan that sir Gawein was departed fro his felowes, he
rode forth thourgh the foreste, he and v knyghtes of
his companye, and ther thei departed, and eche wente his wey,
for he wolde ride sooll by hym-self, and in this wise thei
departed, so that eche of hem toke his wey; and sir Gawein rode
so a-lone serchinge grete part of the londe, till it fill on a day
that he rode pensif and hevy, for that he myght not finde
Merlin; and in this stody he entred in to a foreste, and he
hadde riden a-boute two walsh myle ther com a damesell hym
a-gein that rode on the feirest palfrey of the worlde, and was
all blak, and sadell and the stiropes were all of golde, and
the cloth of scarlet trailinge to the erthe, and the bridill of
golde, and she was clothed in white samyte, and hir kirchires
of silke, and richely atired, and com ridinge be-fore sir Gawein


<EPB/><PB N="690" ID="pb.690"/>

as he was in this pensifnesse, that he dide her not salue; and
whan he was passed the Damesell she reyned hir bridill, and
turned the heed of hir palfrey, and seide, "Gawein, Gawein,
  <MILESTONE N="243b" UNIT="folio"/>hit is not trewe the renomee that renneth of the thourgh the
reame of logres; ffor it is seide of the that thou art the best
knyght of the worlde, and of that thei sey trouthe.  Also it is
seide that thou art the gentilest and the most curteise knyght,
but in that faileth the renoon, for thou art the moste vileyn
knyght that euer I mette in my lif, that in this forest so fer fro
peple haste me I-met a-lone, and so grete felonye in the is roted,
that thow deynest not me ones to salue ne to speke a worde,
and knowe thow verily thow shalt it repente of that thow hast
don, in so moche that thou shalt wissh thou haddest it not don
for all the reame of logres."  And whan sir Gawein vndirstode
the damesell, he was sore a-shamed, and turned a-gein hir his
bridell of gringalet, and seide all shamefast as ye shull
heren.  "Damesell," quod sir Gawein, "so helpe me <CORR SIC="go">god</CORR>, I thought
vpon a thinge that I go sechinge, and ther-fore I pray yow that
ye for-yeve it me that I haue mys-don."  "So helpe me god,"
quod the damesell, "rather shalt thou a-bye it full dere, ffor
I-nough thou shalt haue of shame and lothlynesse, and ther-fore
remembre a-nother tyme whan thou metest with eny lady or
damesell, that thou hir salue for curtesie.  But I sey not that
it shall the euer endure, ne of that thou goist sechinge shalt
thou finde noon in the reame of logres that the can telle no
tidinge, but in the litill breteigne maist thou here som maner
tidinges; and I will go now ther as I haue to don, and thou
shalt go seche that thou art moved fore; and the firste man that
thou metest with mote thou be like till thou se me eft-sones."
Than departed sir Gawein and the damesell; but he hadde not
riden fully half a walissh myle thourgh the foreste that he mette
with the duerf knyght; and the damesell that on the euen
be-fore were departed fro sir Ewein, and hedde sent the foure
knyghtes in Arthurs prison, and it was on trinite sonday a-boute
mydday, and than he remembred hym on the damesell that he
hadde mette be-fore, and lefte his pensifnesse, and seide to the

<EPB/><PB N="691" ID="pb.691"/>

damesell, "God yeve you good day and moche ioye of hir
companye;" and the damesell and the duerf hym ansuerde that
god yeve hym good a-uenture; and so thei past a litill a-sonder,
sir Gawein on that oon part, and thei on that other; and whan
thei were departed a litill thens the duerf knyght be-com a-gein
in to his bewte as he hadde be at the first tyme, and was in
the age of xxij yere, right wele furnysshed and wonderly well
shapen of large stature, and ther-fore hym be-hoved to do a-wey
his armes, for thei were to hym nothinge meete; and whan the
damesell saugh hir love come a-gein in to so grete bewte, she
hadde so grete ioye that no tonge myght it telle, and caste hir
armes a-boute his nekke, and hym kiste an hundred tymes, and
ride forth that oon by that other gladde and ioyfull in grete
solas, and thanked oure lorde of the honour that he hadde hem
don, and praied oure lorde to sende sir Gawein good a-uenture,
that hadde seide that god yeve hem ioye, and so hadde he don,
and thus thei ride forth theire iourney.  But now shull we
speke of Gawein.</P><P>  Whan that sir Gawein was passed the duerf knyght, and
the damesell wele a two bowe draught, a-noon he
felte that the sleeves of his hauberk passed fer of lengthe ouer
his hondes, and   <MILESTONE N="244a" UNIT="folio"/>also the lengthe of his hauberk henge down
be-nethe his feet, and his legges were waxen so short that thei
passed not the skirtes of the sadill; and be-hilde and saugh
how his hosen of stiell resten in the stiropes, and saugh how
his shelde henge toward the erthe, and a-perceyved wele that
he was become a duerf, and seide to hym-self that that it was
that the damesell hadde hym promysed, and ther-with he wax
so worth, that for a litill he hadde gon oute of his witte, and
rode forth so in that wrathe and in that anguyssh in the foreste,
till he fonde a crosse and a ston therby; and thider he rode
and a-light vpon the ston and toke his stiropes, and made hem
shorter, and his hosen of stiel, and the renges of his swerde,
and the gige of his shilde, and the sleves of his hauberk,
with thonges of lether vpon his shuldres, and a-raied hym in
the beste wise he myght, so wroth and angry, that he hadde


<EPB/><PB N="692" ID="pb.692"/>

leuer to be deed than on lyve; and after that he lepte vp and
rode forth his wey, and cursed the day and the hour that euer
he entred in to that quest, for shamed he was and dishonoured;
and so hath he gon in this maner that neuer he lefte castell,
ne town, ne burgh, but that he asked tidinges of Merlin of alle
the men and women that he mette, and many oon he mette that
grete shame and grete reproves hym seiden; and neuertheles he
dide many prowesses, ffor though he were a duerf and
mysshapen he hadde not loste his strengthe, neithir his hardinesse,
and many a knyght he conquered; and whan he hadde serched
the reame of logres vp and down, and saugh that he cowde not
finde Merlin, he thought to passe the see, and go in to the
litill Breteigne; and so he dide, and serched it fer and nygh,
but neuer cowde he here no tidinge of Merlin, and so it drough
nygh the terme that he hadde promysed to returne; and than
he seide to hym-self, "Allas, what shall I now do for the terme
a-proched that I muste returne by the oth that haue sworn
to myn oncle to repeire; returne moste I nede, for elles sholde
I be for-sworn and vn-trewe, and that will I not in no maner,
ffor the oth was soche that yef I were in my delyuer powste,
and in my powste am I nought, for I am disfigured and
a thinge of grete dispite, and I haue nought of my-self, and

Brocheliande, and wolde turne for to come to the see, and euer

by his right name, he ansuerde and seide, "Who is
that in the name of god that to me doth speke?"  "How is
that," quod the voice, "ne knowe ye me nought, ye were wonte
to knowe me right wele, but so goth the worlde, and trewe is
the proverbe that the wise man seith that 'who is a fer from
his iye is soone for-yeten,' and so fareth it be me; ffor while

Whan sir Gawein herde the voice thus speke, he thought a-noon
it was Merlin, and ansuerde a-noon, "Certes, it is trouthe I
ought you wele for to knowe, for many tyme haue I herde youre

that I may yow se."  "My lorde sir Gawein," quod Merlin,
"me shull ye neuer se, and that hevieth me sore that I may

toke the damesell leve of sir Gawein and departed, and hir two

Gawein a-bood there and lengthed his hauberke, and appareiled
his shelde and his armes full richely, and lepte vpon the
gringalet with his shelde aboute his nekke, and his spere in
hande, and rode forth toward Cardoell so fro day to day, till that
he com thider at the terme devised; and the same day that
sir Ewein and Segramor, and her felowes were comen, and eche
of hem hadde seide his a-uenture of that was hem be-fallen in<NOTE1 PLACE="foot" N="*" ID="note.49">The MS. is imperfect and breaks off here, the conclusion is a translation from the French original, the MS. of which is in the British Museum Library.</NOTE1> [this Quest.  And when Sir Gawain was come, then was the joy
and mirth complete.  And Sir Gawain told them all the things
that had happened to him in this Quest, and the barons
marvelled at it very greatly.  And King Arthur was much grieved
about Merlin, but could do nothing more in it, and must needs
suffer: so they betook themselves to making the greatest mirth
they could for Sir Gawain.</P><P>  Whilst they were thus rejoicing, there entered into the
hall Evadeam, who was twenty-two years old, and so
beautiful and gentle that no one handsomer could be found in
the two kingdoms.  And he held his damsel by the hand, and they
came before the king, and saluted him right courteously.  And
the king returned him his salute; and the knight said to him,
"Sire, you know me not; and no wonder, for you never saw me
but once, and that was in such guise that no one who saw me
now and had seen me then, would know me unless he had known
me from childhood."  "Certes, handsome friend," answered



    <EPB/><PB N="698" ID="pb.698"/>

King Arthur, "I do not recollect that I ever saw you before,
but you are a very handsome knight."  "Sire," said Evadeam,
"do you remember a damsel who brought you a dwarf that you
knighted?"  "Yes," said the king, "I may well remember
that, for the knight has sent me five captive knights whom he
conquered by his prowess."</P><P>  "Sire," said then Evadeam, "I am the dwarf you knighted,
and see here is the damsel who prayed you to do
it.  And without doubt I sent you those captives, and the four last
of them Sir Ywain saw, for he found me fighting them in the
valley on Trinity eve; and next day by good hap I rode right
at noon in the forest of Broceliande, I and my damsel, and we met
my lord Gawain, whom I neither hear nor see here [?]  And he
saluted us, and we him, and he said, "May God give you
joy."  And so God did, for at the very moment that the words slipped
from his mouth I recovered the shaped and look that you see;
for then was I a dwarf, ugly and hideous.  So I believe verily
that his words and his prayer availed me so far that God
brought me out of the great shame in which I was; and I
thank for it our Lord and him."  And then the King asked him
who he was, and of what people; and he told him all in order,
as you have heard herein before.  And when the King, and Sir
Gawain, and the others heard this, they were all right glad and
right joyous; and the King received him as a companion like
those of the Table Round.  And the damsel dwelt with the
Queen in right great joy and in right great mirth.  Now here
the story becomes silent about King Arthur and his company,
and returns to tell of King Ban of <CORR SIC="Benoy">Benoyc</CORR>, and King Bohort,
his brother, who was King of Gannes, who are both in their
own lands.</P><P>  Here says the story that when King Arthur had departed
from King Ban of Benoyc, and his brother King Bohort
of Gannes, that the two brothers dwelt in Benoyc in right great
joy and in right great mirth, and with them were their wives,
who were right beautiful and gentle.  Then it happened, as it
pleased our Lord, that King Ban had by his wife a son, who
was named at his baptism Gallead, and surnamed Lancelot.  This
name of Lancelot remained to him all his life, and King Ban and
the Queen his wife had right great joy of him, and the Queen
loved him so much that she fed him with her own milk.  And
the wife of King Bohort had a son whom they called Lyonel,
who was a right lovely child and well mannered; and in the
twelfth month afterwards she had another son whom they called
Bohort; and these three children were afterwards of great renown
in the kingdom of Logres, and they made themselves known
through all lands by their prowess.  Soon after Bohort was
born—the youngest of the two children of King Bohort—the

<EPB/><PB N="699" ID="pb.699"/>

King Bohort fell into a great sickness, and lay long in the city
of Gannes, for which King Ban, his brother, was very sorrowful
and in great distress; for he could not be with him as his will
was, on account of a neighbour of his, who bordered on him,
and who was very fell and cruel.  This was King Claudas of the
Desert, who was so grieved and angry (about his Castle which
King Arthur had caused to be levelled), that he was nearly
going out his senses; and he did not know on whom to take
vengeance, except on King Ban of Benoyc, and on King Bohort,
who bordered on him, because they were King Arthur's
men.  So he warred on them, and wrought so that he had for helper
a prince of Rome, who was named Poince Antony, and who
came to him right willingly, because he too hated King Arthur
and all his, for the love of Luce, the Emperor of Rome,
whom they had slain.  And in this contest was killed Hoel of
Nantes, who had warred greatly on Claudas.  And the Romans
wrought so that they had all Gaul under their dominion; and
they sent the men of Gaul, and the men of the Desert, and
Poince Antony with all his Romans, to attack King Ban of
Benoyc.  And the King defended himself right vigourously, as
one who was of great heart and of great prowess, and he fought
often with the enemy in the open field, and often lost and often
won; and Leonces of Paerne, and Graciens of Trebes, and
Bannins, a godson of King Ban, did marvellous deeds of arms,
and destroyed and slew many of the people of King Claudas;
and Graciens died there, but Phariens died not.  And King Ban
became so weakened in men [?] that he could not endure against
the Romans, but they attacked him so from day to day that they
took his castles and his fortresses, and he could never get help
from King Bohort, his brother, who was lying sick in bed,
whence he never after rose.  And this did him great discomfort,
for Poince Antony had brought so many people that they took
from him his city of <CORR SIC="Benoy">Benoyc</CORR> and all his land, so that there
was left to him neither castle nor city, except only the castle
of Trebes, where Queen Helaine was, and Lancelot her son, who
lay still in his cradle.  And king Ban had there with him as
many people as he could get together, but they were few to
endure such attacks.  Bannins his godson was there, in whom
he trusted much, and with reason, for he was a good and loyal
knight.  And he had a seneschal, whom he had brought up
from childhood, to whom he had entrusted all his land after
Gracien's death; and this was he who betrayed him, and by
whom he lost the Castle of Trebes, as the Story will tell you
hereinafter.</P><TRAILER>Explicit the shutting up of Merlin.<LB/>
