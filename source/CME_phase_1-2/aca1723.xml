THE INDENTURE FOR RICHARD AND AGNES FORTESCU 29 SEPTEMBER, 1424</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>This is a draft, on paper, of the deed which Thomas Stonor enclosed in the following letter. The original (<HI1 REND="i">Ancient Deeds</HI1>, C. 3015) has some altera|tions which it was not worth showing. The last three lines are added in another hand. The deed has a certain interest as having been drafted by the famous Sir John Fortescue, then quite a young lawyer: it is perhaps too much to assume that any part of the draft is in his handwriting. Richard Fortescue was the third son of Sir John Fortescue, the father of the Chief Justice; he was killed at St. Albans in 1455 (Stow, <HI1 REND="i">Annales</HI1>, p. 399); the deed shows that it was he who married Agnes, daughter of Richard Holcombe, and not his son as commonly stated (<HI1 REND="i">Works of Sir J. Fortescue</HI1>, ii, 151-2, ed. Lord Clermont).</P><P>This Indenture was possibly the sequel of an earlier dispute, as to which there was a Petition in Chancery by Thomas Chaucer, John Golafre, John Hurlegh, "chapeleyn," John Warefeld, and Thomas Berdelegh, showing that they were seised of the manor and hundred of Ermington, till one Richard Fortescu of great malice and forethought made a forcible entry and broke down hedges and ditches.

THOMAS STONOR TO [SIR JOHN FORTESCUE] [30 OCTOBER, 1424]</HEAD><ARGUMENT>The reference to "my uncle Belknap" shows that the writer of this letter was Thomas Stonor (<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> 1431), whose mother was a daughter of Sir Robert Belknap. The previous document (which is clearly "your son Richard's" in|denture) gives the date 1424, and shows that the letter was addressed to Sir John Fortescue, the father of the Chief Justice: the Chief Justice first appears as "gubernator" at Lincoln's Inn in 1425, so that this letter is perhaps the earliest extant reference to him in his legal career. Richard Fortescue, the judge's younger brother, is noticed on p. 36 above. Wytbury is probably the John Wydbury of Cornwall, who occurs in conjunction with John Crokker of Lyneham, near Ermington, in February, 1422 (<HI1 REND="i">Cal. Pat.

It must therefore have been addressed to the first Thomas Stonor. With this the reference to John Martyn agrees, for there was a John Martyn on the commission of peace for Kent from 1413-36. In any case it would have been difficult to assign the letter to the time of the second Thomas Stonor; for Alice Drayton owned Horton till her death in October, 1468, and John Forth was bailiff in October, 1469 (see No. 101). The letter is now separated from the Stonor papers, to which it no doubt belongs, and is in <HI1 REND="i">A.C.</HI1>, li, 63.</ARGUMENT><P>To my Worshipful lord.

His wife is to have for life all lands and tenements acquired in Clyve, Westbere, Chestelet, Hopelond, Stureye, and Horton in Kent, and the Manor of Penyton Meysy with the advowson, for the sustinence and finding in food, clothes and education (<HI1 REND="i">in victu, vestitu et doctrina</HI1>) of his daughters. Thomas Chaucer, whilst alive, is to have the governance and supervi|sion of his son and heir Thomas, with the issues and profits of the Manor of Hembury for his sustinence till the age of twenty-one. The marriage of his said son is to be sold by Chaucer, his wife Alice, his brother John Hampden, and John Warfeld. The proceeds are to be applied for the marriages of his daughters, Elizabeth, Maud, Philippa, Joan, and Anne, together with the issues and profits of the Manors of Dodecote, Sottewell, and Bensheves, Berks, and Stonor, Watlyngton and Cleyore in Oxfordshire. His daughters are during their minority to be in the governance of his widow, Chaucer, Hampden and Warfeld. Each daughter is to have 200 marks at least for her marriage.

His wife, Chaucer, Hampden and Warfeld are then to dispose of the profits of the marriages of his male heirs and of the said Manors during the minority of his heirs in discharge of his conscience, according to the will and ordinance of his parents and ancestors as in their last wills more fully appears. In the event of his wife's death his son John is to have the reversion of the Manor of Burewardescote on condition that he release to his brother Thomas his right in gavelkind to all lands in Kent, as well those which Thomas Stonor held in right of his wife as those newly acquired.</P><P><HI1 REND="i">On the second page is a valuation:</HI1>—</P><P>Debita que debentur Thome de Stonore per estimacionem Johannis Warfeld.</P><P>De finibus de Hembury, xxx. li.

THE BATTLE OF ST. ALBANS 21-22 MAY, 1455</HEAD><ARGUMENT>Amongst the <HI1 REND="i">Ch. Misc.</HI1>, 37, iii, 4-11, there is an English narrative of the Battle of St. Albans, which seems to have been written and circulated in the interest of the Yorkist party. It was communicated to <HI1 REND="i">Archæologia</HI1> (vol. xx, pp. 519-22) in 1822 by John Bayley, keeper of the Records in the Tower, who attributed it to Sir William Stonor, misled as it would seem by the fact that Sir William Stonor was 24 years afterwards steward of St. Albans Abbey at Wallingford (see No. 244). The presence of the document amongst the Stonor MSS. seems to be accidental. Dr. Gairdner reprinted the text from <HI1 REND="i">Archæologia</HI1> in the <HI1 REND="i">Paston Letters</HI1>, No. 283. There is thus no need to re|print it here, though it seems right to record the source whence it was derived. Apart from some slight variations in spelling the printed text is accurate, ex|cept at two points. The name of the place in St. Peter's Street, where the King's banner was pitched, should be "Goslawe" not "Boslawe". In the list of Lords who were hurt there should be inserted between Buckingham and Stafford: "the lord of Dudle with an arowe in the vysage". The original is on a large sheet of paper folded to make 16 pages; the narrative is written on the first 6½ pages.</ARGUMENT><P>

HUMPHREY FORSTER TO THOMAS STONOR 21 OCTOBER [1466]</HEAD><ARGUMENT>This seems to have reference to the death of Thomas Sackvile of Falley or Fawley in 1466—see Nos. 88 and 89. Sackvile's wife Isabel was a sister of Thomas Stonor and of Forster's wife. Rokes was Sackvile's nephew and heir (see note on No. 89). In <HI1 REND="i">Ch. Misc.</HI1>, 37, ix, 38-39, there is the rough draft of a contract of marriage between Thomas, eldest son and heir-apparent of Thomas Rokes, and a daughter (unnamed) of Stonor. If the said daughter died "before flesshly knowleche had" another daughter, if unmarried and of convenient age, was to take her place. Rokes bargained to make a grant of the reversion of the lands which Isabel, late wife of Thomas Sakevyle, held for life, to the value of 20 marks a year, and of other lands to the value of 10 marks. If Rokes' son at the age of fourteen and Stonor's daughter at the age of thirteen disagree the contract was to be void. The marriage does not seem to have ever taken effect though it was still being discussed in 1477—see No. 179. The marriage contract was probably drafted about the date of this letter.

THOMAS ROKES TO THOMAS STONOR [1 OCTOBER, 1467]</HEAD><ARGUMENT>Sir Thomas Sakeville of Falley or Fawley, Bucks, had a son Thomas, and a daughter Maud who married N. Kentwood. The second Thomas Sakeville had a son Thomas and a daughter Margery. The third Thomas is probably the husband of Isabel, sister of Thomas Stonor (<HI1 REND="i">d.</HI1> 1474). Margery married Thomas Rokes, no doubt the Thomas Rokes the elder of Ascot and Wing who died in 1457, and mentions in his will Margery his wife, and his sons John Rokes and Robert Rufford.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="DLPS37">For a lawsuit by his executors see <HI1 REND="i">Placita de Banco</HI1>, 818, m. 41.</NOTE1> He was presumably the father of Thomas Rokes the writer of this letter, who calls Isabel Sackville his aunt, for in an inquisition held in 1487 it was found that Thomas Rokes son of Margery Sakeville inherited property granted to N. Kentwood as heir of Sir Thomas Sakeville. Thomas Rokes the younger calls Thomas Stonor his brother, and must therefore have been married to his sister or half-sister; from No. 182 it appears that his wife's name was Alice, and since Alice daughter of the elder Thomas Stonor was married to Humphrey Forster, it is probable that Alice Rokes was a daughter of Alice and Richard Drayton (Wrottesley, <HI1 REND="i">Pedigrees from the Plea Rolls</HI1>, pp. 438, 441, 458; <HI1 REND="i">Cal.

A pedigree in <HI1 REND="i">Harley MS.</HI1>, 1139, f. 45, makes the second Thomas Rokes of Falley marry a daughter of Fowler of Ricote, and his son, a third Thomas, marry a daughter of Sir William Stonor; the last statement is certainly incorrect.

There are, however, no Returns of Members of Parliament for 1455, 1461, 1463 and 1470, and Stonor may have sat in one of these Parliaments. But Richard Restwold was a party to the deed of 1 Dec., 1432—No. 56—and the letter may have been addressed to the first Thomas Stonor, who sat in the Parliaments of 1429 and 1431.

SIR RICHARD HARCOURT TO THOMAS STONOR 1 FEB. [? 1470]</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>The chief subject of this letter was clearly the marriage of Thomas Stonor's ward, John Cottesmore, to one of his daughters—probably Joan—see Nos. 128 and 136. I cannot explain why Harcourt addresses Stonor as "my ffadyr". The letter would naturally imply that Harcourt was married to a daughter of Thomas Stonor, and that a son or daughter of his by a former wife was going to marry a daughter or son of Thomas Stonor. But Richard Harcourt is said to have married (1) Edith, daughter of Thomas Sencler or St. Clere, by whom he had a son Christopher and a daughter Anne; (2) Eleanor, daughter of Sir Roger Lewknor, by whom he had a son John, who married Margaret, daughter of William Bray; and (3) Katherine, 
<EPB/><PB REF="00000181.tif" SEQ="00000181" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNS" CNF="999" N="113, vol. 1"/> daughter of Sir Thomas de la Pole, and widow of Sir Miles Stapleton, by whom he had a son William. Christopher Harcourt married Joan, younger daughter of Sir Miles and Katherine Stapleton. Anne Harcourt married Henry Fiennes, Lord Say. In his will Harcourt mentions two other daughters, Isabell, and Alice, wife of William Besillys. He mentions his two wives, Edith and Katherine, but there is no reference to Eleanor nor to her alleged son John. (See Collins' <HI1 REND="i">Peerage</HI1>, iv, 436-7, ed. Brydges; <HI1 REND="i">Harcourt Papers</HI1>, i, 73-6; Blomefield, <HI1 REND="i">History of Norfolk</HI1>, ix, 320-21; <HI1 REND="i">P.C.C.</HI1>, 27 Logge.) It would be a simple solution to the difficulty if we could suppose that the Richard Harcourt of this letter was a different person to the well-known knight. But the writer of No. 145 was certainly Sir Richard Harcourt, and the signatures of both letters are in the same hand, and have paraphs of identical design. Moreover, Sir Richard Harcourt and Thomas Stonor were co-feoffees for Katherine Arundel (see No. 125). The pretended relationship must therefore remain a mystery. In his letter to William Stonor (No. 145) Harcourt signs himself as "your loving cosyn," but in this letter refers to "my brother William Stonor". If there had been a child-marriage between children of Harcourt and Stonor it would explain "my daughter and yours"; but even of this there is no evidence, though if one of the parties had died young that would be not unnatural.</P><P>As to the date of the letter the reference to Harcourt's business about the King's matters would suggest 1467, when he was sheriff of Oxon and Berks. But since Sir Miles Stapleton only died in October, 1466, Harcourt is not very likely to have married his widow before 1 Feb., 1467. Moreover, the marriage of Cottesmore to Thomas Stonor's daughter was some time later than October, 1468—see No. 137. This letter is therefore probably not later than 1 Feb., 1470. Dame Katherine Harcourt was niece by marriage to Alice, Duchess of Suffolk, which makes the reference to "our own good lady" natural. This letter may just possibly be holograph; but probably is signed only, like No. 145.

WADEHILL TO THOMAS STONOR 17 JANUARY [1471?]</HEAD><ARGUMENT>This letter from a servant of John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, was clearly written after the birth of the Duke's eldest son, John, who was probably born in 1464, and before the death of his mother, the Duchess Alice, in May, 1475. The only intervening years in which 17th January fell on a Thursday were 1465 and 1471. The former seems precluded by the mention of "the young ladies," since Suffolk's daughters were probably younger children; though the fact that an adjourned Parliament met in 1465 on 21st January would make this date otherwise suitable. The date 1471 is difficult, since it involves a reference to an otherwise unknown meeting of the Parliament of the Lancastrian Restoration.

BOND BY WILLIAM STONOR TO RICHARD FOWLER 9 MAY, 1475</HEAD><ARGUMENT>Richard Fowler, besides being Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, was a prominent man in Oxfordshire. He was a nephew of Richard Quatermayns (see Nos. 93 and 116). Leland states that Quatermayns had "a servant caullid <HI1 REND="i">Thomas</HI1> Fowler, his clerk, a toward felowe that after was Chauncelor of the duchy of Lancastre," and was godfather to his son and "namid hym Richard Quatermains Fowler"; the second Richard Fowler was Quatermayns' heir, but proved "a very onthrift and sold al his landes" (<HI1 REND="i">Itinerary</HI1>, i, 115). The elder Richard Fowler was an arbitrator between William Stonor and his mother (see No. 156); he may be the "Master Fowler" of Nos. 71 and 174, and "Cousin Fowler" of Nos. 170 and 172. Quatermayns calls Thomas Stonor his cousin in No. 92. Fowler died in Nov., 1477 (Will, P.C.C., 32 Wattys). For this Bond, which has been cancelled by cutting, see Nos. 144 and 145.

No. 153 shows that the writer had lately been in trouble, and this letter may perhaps be a little earlier in date.

ELIZABETH STONOR TO WILLIAM STONOR 18 AUGUST, 1476</HEAD><ARGUMENT>"My brodyr Stocker" is Sir William Stocker, husband of Elizabeth Stonor's sister Margaret. "My brodyr Crooke" is probably her own brother John. If "my husbond's terement" refers to the anniversary of Thomas Ryche's death, he must have died nearly a year before his will was proved. Elizabeth Stonor seems to have spent all the latter part of 1476 in London. Unlike most of Elizabeth Stonor's letters this is holograph. Since 18 August, 1476, was on a Sunday, the time to Tuesday next seems short; but in the following letter there is expectation of an equally speedy reply.

"My Cyster Barantyne" is William Stonor's sister Mary, whose hus|band John Barantyne was under age (see No. 294). Elizabeth Stonor, the third sister, was apparently unmarried. John Barantyne's mother Elizabeth had married as her second husband Sir John Boteler, who died on 14 June, 1477 (<HI1 REND="i">Chancery Inq. p.m.,</HI1> Edward IV, file 61, No. 25).

The trouble that led to the riot seems to be referred to in No. 179.

HENRY MAKNEY TO WILLIAM STONOR [<HI1 REND="i">before</HI1> 1478]</HEAD><ARGUMENT>Henry Makney of Makney or Mackney, near Wallingford, in Berkshire, had a lawsuit between 1467 and 1472 with John Colyngrygge. Colyngrygge and his wife Isabell, together with John FitzRobert, and his wife Agnes, pleaded that William Makney, great-grandfather (<HI1 REND="i">besayll</HI1>) of Isabell and Agnes, was seised of the manor of Makney and levied a fine in 1350 entailing it on him and his wife Elyn and the heirs of their bodies, with remainder to his right heirs; and that Henry Makney, son of Richard, son of William, son of the said William and Elyn, and whole brother of Isabell and Agnes, saying that he had been married 15 years and had no issue, had covenanted with Thomas Stonor, esquire, for 20<HI1 REND="i">l.</HI1>, part of a great sum to be paid, that the 
<EPB/><PB REF="00000265.tif" SEQ="00000265" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNS" CNF="999" N="31, vol. 2"/> manor should be made sure to Stonor and his heirs. To this Henry Makney replied that his father Richard was seised in his demesne as of fee, and so enfeoffed Sir Robert Shotebroke and others, who granted the manor to Richard and Margaret his wife. After Richard's death Margaret made an estate in a moiety of the manor to Henry for her life; she was still alive and seised of the manor, Henry not holding by the fine. He denied the alleged bargain. Colyngrygge replied asking for Makney to be bound not to defeat the fine (<HI1 REND="i">Early Chancery Proceedings</HI1>, 40/87-89). The litigation may have been pro|longed, but seems from these letters to have been decided in Makney's favour. This letter is earlier than 1478; it is convenient to place it here in conjunc|tion with the next two documents. From No. 192, William Stonor would seem to have acquired some right in the manor; in the Arbitrament between him and his mother he was awarded Makney's obligacion of £40, whereof £20 was yet due (see vol. i, p. 164 above). Leland describes Mackney as "a pratie manor place of brike," builded by one Courte, "uncle to Molines that now dwellith there" (<HI1 REND="i">Itinerary</HI1>, i, 120).

RICHARD PAGE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 7 JULY [? 1478]</HEAD><ARGUMENT>This letter clearly belongs to the same time as Nos. 219 and 221. Since Stonor is a knight the date cannot be earlier than 1478. Otherwise the only clue to the date is the statement in this letter that the King was to be at Windsor on 8 July, and was going thence to Nottingham. Edward IV was at Nottingham in 1478, 1481, and 1482. In 1482 he went north at the end of May—see No. 313—and during July was in Kent—3rd, Manor of Knoll, 7th and 8th, Canterbury, 9th to 18th, Dover (<HI1 REND="i">Chancery Warrants</HI1>, Series I, File 882). In 1481 he seems to have been at Southwell on 28th June to 5th July, and at Scrooby on 13th to 19th July (<HI1 REND="i">Cal. Pat. Rolls</HI1>, iii, 279-80). The <HI1 REND="i">Chancery Warrants</HI1> (for Privy Seals) do not give clear evidence for move|ments in July, 1481, which year the evidence of the Patent Rolls makes un|likely. If the year is 1481 there is the further difficulty that Stonor must have married his third wife within two months of the death of his second. In 1478 Edward IV was at Greenwich from 2nd to 6th July, was perhaps in

In No. 247 and all subsequent letters Page addresses Stonor as "knight for the King's body"; he does not do so in this letter nor in No. 221, an omission which suggests that they were earlier than 1479. So on the whole 1478 seems to be the most likely date, but the point is of no great importance. The Chamber|lain is William Hastings.

THOMAS HOWLAKE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 24 JULY 1478</HEAD><ARGUMENT><P>It does not seem possible to explain the whole of Howlake's transactions; no doubt there were some things which would have been obvious to his em|ployer but are obscure to us. A comparison with Nos. 2 and 41 in the <HI1 REND="i">Cely Papers</HI1> gives a partial clue. The first figures (xl., xxxij., xxxvij., and j) are the numbers of the serplars (see No. 159 above). Each serplar contained 2½ sacks (ss. di.) with a number of odd cloves. A clove contained 7 lb., and there were 52 cloves to the sack. So the total weight would be 10 sacks + 149 cloves, or 12 sacks 45 cloves; the total weight clear is given, however, as only 11½ sacks 14 cloves. From the Cely Account it appears that in selling a rebate was allowed. In the Cely Account (No. 41) the rebate was 2 cloves on the sack, and fractions of less than half a sack were disregarded; but 
<EPB/><PB REF="00000296.tif" SEQ="00000296" RES="600dpi" FMT="TIFF6.0" FTR="UNS" CNF="999" N="62, vol. 2"/> (perhaps as compensation) the rebate on the last serplar was 4 cloves, though it only contained 1 sack 18 cloves. In Howlake's account the total rebate was apparently 57 cloves; if we calculate it at 4½ cloves the sack and dis|regard resulting fractions of cloves, the rebate on the first serplar was 15 cloves, and on each of the others 14, giving the total of 57. This explains the "poyse". The price of 11½ sacks 14 cloves at 19 marks the sack should be £149 1s. 6d., not £147 12s. 8d.; possibly there was a reduction in respect of a broken sack; or it may be that this is the "more respyte" to which Howlake refers. The value in sterling money agrees with the value in Flemish (£180 8s. 9g.), if one-third is taken at 25s. 4g. Flemish for £1 sterling, and the rest at 24s. It is therefore clear that Howlake when he wrote "viij s. g. ffl." meant only 8 shillings Flemish. The "g" presumably means "groot"; but it is clear that if so there were, as calculated, 12 groots to the shilling; for on this basis the three bills exactly make up £180 8s. 9d. Flemish.</P><P>Peter van de Rade and Danyell van de Rade, merchants of Bruges, appear in the <HI1 REND="i">Cely Papers</HI1> (Nos. 2 and 10). Dr. John Coke was employed in July, 1478, to treat with Thomas de Plana, the representative of Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy "super Intercursu ac communicatione Mercansie necnon Piscatione super mare," and to arrive at a settlement of all commercial grievances between England and Flanders. As a result a treaty was con|cluded on 12 July; to the treaty there were annexed documents dealing with the complaints of the Merchants of the Staple, fixing Ordinances for the Staple at Calais and providing for the inspection of the wool-trade there (<HI1 REND="i">Foedera</HI1>, xii, 66-86). "Thursday last" was 23 July, the day before Howlake wrote his letter, so that news of what had been done at Bruges could hardly have reached Calais.

On the same paper is a copy of another deed dated 6 Dec., 1479. The grant of the stewardship may fairly be assigned to the same time. This letter suits well with 1479, for in that year 16th Nov. was on a Tuesday; Carnebull was going to Leicester on the following Monday, would stay there till the 26th, and then would be at Newark till 4 Dec., and at Lincoln till 12 Dec. Quatermayns and Fowler, who seem to have held the stewardship of Thame, both died in 1477. As Stonor was a knight this letter could not in any case be earlier than 1478, so that there must have been an interval between Fowler's death and Stonor's appointment.

MARY BARANTYNE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR [13 NOV. 1481]</HEAD><ARGUMENT>John Barantyne of Little Haseley, Chalgrove and Churchill, son of Drue Barantyne by Jane, daughter of Sir John Wroughton, married Elizabeth, daughter and coheiress of Sir Stephen Popham. He died on 30 June, 1474 (<HI1 REND="i">Chancery Inq. p.m.</HI1>, Edward IV., file 50, no. 36). On 5 Aug., 1475, Richard Frebodie and others were accused of having abducted Elizabeth, widow of John Barantyne, by force from the House of the Friars Preachers in London (<HI1 REND="i">Early Chancery Proceedings</HI1>, 52/3). In his will (dated 28 June, 1474, proved 8 April, 1477) John Barantyne directed that his sons, John the elder, Austyn, and John the younger, and his daughter Anne, should "be ruled and guyded by Elizabeth, my wife," who was to hold all his lands for life, except lands in Chalgrove purchased of Sir Richard Harcourt, and lands in Goldore called Symyuns lands, purchased of Alice, Duchess of Suffolk, which John his son and heir was to have (<HI1 REND="i">P.C.C.</HI1>, Wattys, 34). All the children were under age; John the elder was returned as fourteen years of age and more in October, 1474. A document in <HI1 REND="i">Ch. Misc.</HI1>, 37, iv, 20 gives particulars "for the astate to Marie Barantyne" which are thus summarised: "Of Seyntcleres lond in Chalgrove, lx. s. Symeons in Goldore, lxvj. s. viij. d. And of Atyndon in the paroch. of Thame, lxxiij. s. viij. d. Summa, x. li. For my mastres Marie Barantynes joyntour." From No. 172 it would appear that the marriage took place before 22 Oct., 1476, when John Barantyne's widow seems to have been married to Sir John Boteler; in No. 310 it is implied that it took place before the death of John Barantyne the elder. Mary Barantyne's son William was born on 31 Dec., 1481; John Parson remembered that at his christening there was a fire in the belfry, by which the midwife stripped the child, and that Sir William Stonor, who was godfather, said the child loved it (<HI1 REND="i">Cal. Inquisitions</HI1>, Henry VII., ii, 6). This points to 1481 as the probable

It is probable that John and Mary Barantyne were both at this time still under age and so under the control of Elizabeth Barantyne (or Boteler)—see Nos. 310 and 311. In May, 1482, there was a suit brought in the Common Pleas by Thomas Danvers against John Barantyne as to the manor of Wynnale and lands in Wynnale and Henton, which was settled by the sale to Danvers on 8 May, 1482, of the manor together with lands in Wynnale, Shynnor and Henton (<HI1 REND="i">Placita de Banco</HI1>, Roll 880, m. 481, and Rotulus de Cartis, m. 2). Mary Barantyne's letter probably has reference to this transaction. John Barantyne and his mother were involved in much litigation at this time; as to "Seynclere's lands" in a friendly suit with Sir Richard Harcourt; and with John Nowers as to the manor of Churchill (<HI1 REND="i">id.</HI1>, Roll 881, mm. 296, 451, and Rotulus de Cartis, m. 2; see also Roll 876, mm. 443, 444 as to lands in Aston Torold and Northmorton, and the manor of Attyndon).</ARGUMENT><P>The body of the letter and the signature are all in the same hand, which is unusually good and probably that of a professional scribe.

Some light is thrown on this letter by <HI1 REND="i">Early Chancery Proceedings</HI1>, 40/227, where Robert Shynner, the younger, shows that his father, Robert Shynner, the elder, was seised in his demesne as of fee of 3 messuages and 2 acres of land in "Mychell Modbury," and enfeoffed John Rous, John Legh, Walter Torryng, and William Stenlake to the entent that after his death they should make an estate to the petitioner; Legh, Torryng, and Stenlake had done so, but Rous refused, and Shynner therefore prayed for a writ of <HI1 REND="i">sub pœna.</HI1> These proceedings took place between 1467 and 1472. John Shyn|ner was apparently another son of Robert Shynner, the elder. Cristina, widow of Robert Shynner, and John Shynner, as executors of Robert Shyn|ner, sued Richard Fortescue of Valepitte in Michaelmas Term, 1478, for 8 marks (<HI1 REND="i">Placita de Banco</HI1>, Roll 868, m. 96). John Shynner of Modbury, chaplain, had a suit for debt with Robert Tolloke (<HI1 REND="i">Early Chancery Pro|ceedings</HI1>, 66/86, date 1475-80). This letter is probably rather earlier than No. 301, in which case it may perhaps belong to 1481. Shynner in some places wrote "d" (meaning ð) for "th".

THOMAS BANKE TO SIR WILLIAM STONOR 16 JANUARY [1482]</HEAD><ARGUMENT>Thomas Banke was an Oxford D.D., who was Rector of Lincoln College 1493-1509, and Commissary of the University in 1501 and 1502. "My lord Edward" was one of the younger sons of John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk. In Oct., 1480, the University desired of Edward IV that he would send his nephew, "the lord Edward Pole," to study at Oxford. They also asked the Bishop of Salisbury to use his influence. In March, 1481, it was reported that the Bishop would bring him there. On 28 March, 1482, the University wrote to the King praising his nephew's gifts of intellect and heart. In another letter in the same year they repeated their praise, and thanked the King "quod Magistrum Stanley, infantem etiam nobilem atque litterarum studiosum illi prenobili nepoti tuo studiorum suorum comitem adjunxeris". Edward de la Pole cannot have been more than fourteen when he went to Oxford. He was Archdeacon of the East Riding from 15 Oct., 1480, to 6 Jan., 1485, when he became Archdeacon of Richmond; he died not long after. (See <HI1 REND="i">Epistolae Academicae</HI1>, ii, 454-6, 462-3, 478, 484.) Master Stanley was James, son of Thomas Stanley (afterwards Earl of Derby). He was first cousin to Sir William Stonor's third wife, Anne Neville, and was somewhat older than Edward de la Pole. He was bishop of Ely from 1506 till his death in 1515 (<HI1 REND="i">Dict. Nat. Biog.</HI1>, liv, 70). As to Sutton see No. 280. For Master Edmund see No. 194. The references show that the date of the letter must be either 1482 or 1483. Comparison with the reference to the troubles of Stonor's servants at Oxford in the next letter suggests that the former year is the more likely.
