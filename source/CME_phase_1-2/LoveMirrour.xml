Subsequent to keyboarding the text, it was encoded by Catherine Paul, and the markup was reviewed by Kenneth Church.</P><P>With the exception of chapter numbers, none of the manuscript's marginalia has been retained.  Chapter numbers are marked, according to the Latin marginalia, using the abbreviations "Cam." and "Capm." for chapter, with the number written in Roman numerals, and this system has been retained verbatim in the chapter headings in the electronic edition.  Where the chapter number is supplied in the main text, as is the case for Chapter Eleven, the marginal chapter number has not been included. In one instance -- Capm.3m  -- the chapter is divided into three parts, and these are tagged as such with Div2 tags.  In addition, rather than retaining the two chapter 33s as occur in the printed edition, we have kept only the first chapter heading for chapter 33 and tagged the other as a part of chapter 33.</P><P><TITLE>The Mirrour</TITLE> is divided into seven parts corresponding to the days of the week, and each part is in turn divided into chapters.  As there is a header marking the beginning of most of the seven parts, headers have been supplied where they are lacking (e.g., part one, or "Monday").  These supplied headers are noted as such by the presence of square brackets surrounding them, and by explicit notation in their attributes. </P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE></PROFILEDESC></HEADER><TEXT><FRONT><TITLEPAGE><DOCTITLE><TITLEPART>¶THE MIRROUR OF THE BLESSED LYF OF JESU

of portions of the Latin Meditationes Vitae
Christi, a work variously attributed to S. Bonaventura,
the Augustinian Cardinal Bonaventura Baduarius, and
to Joannes Gorus, most frequently to the first-named.
The Meditationes were popular over the whole of Europe,
and were rendered into the vernacular of most Continental
countries.  The English version was made by
Nicholas Love, prior of the Carthusian house of Mount
Grace de Ingelby, Yorks., before 1410; in that year it
was presented to Archbishop Arundel, noted for his
vigorous persecution of the Lollards.  Nothing is
definitely known about Nicholas Love beyond the
statement found in many manuscripts that the translation
was made by him.<NOTE1 N="*" ID="note.1">In 1415 Henry V confirmed to Nicholas, prior of Mount Grace, the alien priory of Hinckley.  This prior is most probably our translator.</NOTE1></P><P>The ascription of the translation to T. Merton, or
Morton, rests upon the note 'Explicit liber speculum vite
Christi per T. Morton', found in MS. Bodley 131, a copy
dating about 1460.</P><P>The number of manuscripts is very great, twenty-three
are known to exist; but the textual variation
between them is of so little importance that the plan
adopted of reproducing one manuscript in collation
with two others is justifiable.  The manuscript I have
chosen for the text is MS. Brasenose College e. 9 (now
deposited in the Bodleian Library).  This copy is quite
perfect, containing portions intentionally omitted in
other manuscripts; it is carefully written in a neat
scribal hand, and has very few textual errors; it was
made about 1430.  An additional interesting feature


<EPB/><PB N="iv" ID="pb.3"/>
in connexion with it is the fact of its having the
translator's monogram at the foot of the first page.</P><P>The two manuscripts which I have collated with
the Brasenose MS. are the Sherard MS. (in the possession
of Lord Aldenham) and another Bodleian copy,
MS. e. Musæo 35.  Both are well-written and finely
illuminated examples, and date from the latter half of
the fifteenth century.</P><P>The 'Mirrour' was printed by Caxton?1488, Pynson
?1495, and by Wynkyn de Worde in 1517 and 1523.</P><P>As regards the treatment of the text it is only
necessary to say that the þ of the manuscript has been
expanded to th; on the other hand, ȝ has been retained,
because of its difference in value; iℏu has been written
Jesu throughout.  The punctuation is editorial, the
pointing of the manuscript being of no value.</P><P>It is not expected that the language will present
any difficulty, but as an aid to those who are unfamiliar
with the earlier forms of our language a word-list has
been added.</P><P>It is a source of deep regret to the editor that the
late Lord Aldenham did not live to see the completion
of a work in which he took great interest, willingly
rendering every assistance in his power towards its
publication.  My thanks are also due to the Librarian
of Brasenose College (Mr. G. H. Wakeling, M.A.), for
permission to transcribe the college manuscript; and
to Sir Henry Ingilby, for the loan of his copy.</P><P>To Dr. W. A. Craigie, who has read the proofs,
I am greatly indebted for many valuable hints and
suggestions; also I have to thank Miss E. R. Steane
for her assistance in the production of the volume.</P><SIGNED>L. F. POWELL.</SIGNED><CLOSER>OXFORD.

that it may be iheled thoruȝ the mekenes of goddis ſone:
there is no couetiſe / bot that it may be heled thoruȝ his
pouerte: ne wraththe / but that it may be heled thoruȝ his
pacience: nor malice / but that hit may be heled thoruȝ
his charitie: and more ouer there is no ſynne or wickedneſſe<EPB/><PB N="8" ID="pb.11"/>
/ but that he ſchal want it and be kept fro it / the
whiche byholdeth inwardely and loueth and foloweth the
wordes and the dedes of that man in whom goddes ſone
ȝaf hym ſelf to vs in to enſample of good lyuynge.  Wherfore
now bothe men and wymmen and euery age and
euery dignyte of this worlde is ſtired to hope of euerelaſtyng
lyf.  And for this hope and to this entente / with
holy writt alſo ben writen dyuerſe bookes and tretees of
devouȝt men· not onliche to clerkes in latyn / but alſo in
engliſh to lewed men and wommen and hem that ben of
ſymple vnderſtondynge.  Among the whiche beth writen
deuout meditaciouns of criſtes lyf / more pleyn in certeyn
parties than is expreſſed in the goſpelle of the foure
euangeliſtes.  And / as it is ſeide / the devout man and
worthy clerk / Bonauenture / wroot hem to a religious womman
in latyn.  The whiche ſcripture and writynge / for
the fructuouſe mater ther of ſterynge ſpecially to the loue
of Jeſu / and alſo for the pleyne ſentence to comune vnderſtondynge
/ ſemeth amonge othere ſouereynly edifienge
to ſymple creatures· the whiche as children hauen nede to
be fedde with mylke of lyȝte doctrine / and not with ſadde
mete of grete clergie and of hiȝe contemplacioun.  Wherfore
/ at the inſtaunce and the prayer of ſomme deuoute
ſoules / to edificacioun of ſuche men or wommen is this
drawynge out of the forſeide book of criſtes lyf wryten in
engliſch / with more putte to in certeyn parties and alſo
with drawynge of dyuerſe auctoritees and materes as it
ſemeth to the writere here of moſt ſpedeful and edifienge
to hem that ben of ſymple vnderſtondynge.  To the whiche
ſymple ſoules / as ſeint Bernard ſeith / contemplacioun of
the manhede of criſte is more lykynge / more ſpedeful / and
more ſiker than is hiȝe contemplacioun of the godhede.
And therfore to hem is principally to be ſette in mynde<EPB/><PB N="9" ID="pb.12"/>
the ymage of criſtes incarnacioun / paſſioun / and reſurreccioun:
ſo that a ſymple ſoule that kan not thenke bot
bodies or bodily thinges mowe haue ſomwhat accordynge
vnto his affeccioun wherwith he may fede and ſtire his deuocioun.
Wherfore it is to vndirſtonde at the bygynnynge
as for a principal and general rule of dyuers ymaginaciouns
that folowen after in this book / that the diſcryuynge
or ſpeches or dedes of god in heuene and angeles and
other goſtly ſubſtaunces ben only writen in this manere and
to this entent / that is to ſeie as deuoute ymaginaciouns
and likneſſes ſtirynge ſymple ſoules to the loue of god and
deſire of heuenly thinges.  For / as ſeint gregory ſeith /
therfore is the kyngdom of heuene lickened to erthely
thinges: that by tho thinges that ben viſible / and that
man kyndely knoweth / he be ſtired and rauyſched to loue
and deſire goſtly inviſible thinges that he kyndely knoweth
not.  Alſo ſeint John ſeith / that alle tho thinges that Jesu
dide ben not writen in the goſpell.  Wherfore we mowen
to ſterynge of deuocioun ymagine and thynke dyuerſe
wordes and dedes of hym and othere that we fynde not
writen / ſo that it be not aȝenſt the byleue / as ſeynt gregor
and other doctoures ſeyne· that holy writt may be expowned
and vndirſtonden in dyuers maneres and to dyuerſe purpoſes
/ ſo that it be not aȝenſt the bileue or gode maneres.
And ſo what tyme or in what place in this book is writen /
that thus dide or thus ſpak oure lord Jeſu or othere that
ben ſpoken of / and it mowe not be preued by holy writ / or
grounded in expreſſe ſeienge of holy doctoures / it ſchal be
taken none othere wiſe than as a devoute meditacioun that
it myȝte be ſo ſpoken or doon.</P><P>¶ And ſo for as moche as in this book ben conteyned
dyuerſe ymaginaciouns of criſtes lyf· the which lyf fro the
bygynnyng in to the endyng euermore bleſſed and with<EPB/><PB N="10" ID="pb.13"/>
outen ſynne / paſſynge alle lyues of alle othere ſeyntes / as
for a ſynguler prerogatyf may worthely be cleped the
bleſſed lyf of Jeſu Criſt.  The whiche alſo be cauſe that it
may not be fully diſcryued as the lifes of othere ſeyntis / but
in a maner of lickenes as the ymage of mannis face is
ſchewed in the mirrour· therfore as for a pertynent name
to this book it may ſkilfully be cleped the mirrour of the
bleſſed lyf of Jeſu criſt.</P><P>¶ Furthermore forto ſpeke of the prophitable mater of
this book.  The forſaide clerk bonauenture / ſpekynge to the
womman forſeide / in his proheme byginneth in this manere
ſentence.  Among other vertues commendynges of the holy
virgyne Cecile it is writen that ſche bare alwey the goſpell
of criſt hyd in hir breſte· that may be vnderſtonde that of
the bleſſed lyf of oure lord Jeſu criſt writen in the goſpell
ſche ches certeyne parties moſte deuoute / in the whiche
ſche ſette hir meditacioun and hir thouȝt nyȝt and day
with a clene and hole herte.  And whan ſche had ſo fully
al the manere of his lyf ouer gone / ſche bygan aȝeyne: and
ſo with a likynge and ſwete taſt gooſtly ſchewynge in that
manere the goſpel of criſt / ſche ſette and bare it euere in the
priuete of her breſt.  In the ſame manere I counſeile that
thou doo.  For among alle goſtly exerciſes I leue that this is
moſt neceſſarye and moſt profitable· and that may brynge
to the hiȝeſt degre of good lyuynge / that ſtant ſpecially in
perfite deſpiſynge of the world / in pacience ſuffrynge of
aduerſitees / and in encres and in getyng of vertues.  For
ſothely thou ſchalt neuere fynde where man may ſo perfiȝtly
be tauȝt: Firſt forto ſtable his herte aȝenſt vanytees and
diſceyuable likynges of the world· alſo to ſtrengthe hym
amonge tribulaciouns and aduerſitees· and furthermore to
be kept fro vices and to getynge of vertues / as in the bliſſed
lyf of oure lord Jeſu / the whiche was euere with oute defauȝte<EPB/><PB N="11" ID="pb.14"/>
moſte perfyte.  Firſt / I ſeie that beſy meditacioun and
cuſtomable of the bleſſid lyf of Jeſu ſtableth the ſoule and
the herte aȝenſt vanitees and deſceyuable likynges of the
world.  This is opounly ſchewed in the bleſſid virgyne
Cecile / bifore nempned / whan ſche filled ſo fully hir herte
of the lyf of Criſt / that vanytees of the world myȝt not
entre in to hir.  For in al the grete pompe of wedding /
where ſo many vanitees ben vſed / whan the orgenes blewen
and ſongen / ſche ſette hir herte ſtabely in god / ſeienge
and preyenge: Lord! be my herte and my body clene
and not defoiled· ſo that I be not confounded.</P><P>¶ Alſo as vnto the ſecounde.  Wherof han martires her
ſtrengthe aȝenſt dyuerce tourmentis / bot / as ſeynt Bernard
ſeith / in that they ſetten all her herte and deuocioun
in the paſſioun and the woundes of criſte?  For what tyme
the martir ſtant with al the body to rent / and neuertheles
he is ioyful and glad in alle his peyne· where troweſt is
than his ſoule and his herte?  Sothely in the woundes of
Jeſu.  Ȝe / the woundes not cloſed / bot open and wyde to

alday: and why ſo bot for her hertes ben more propurly
in criſtes body / be deuoute meditacioun of his bleſſed lyf /
than in hir owne bodies?</P><P>¶ And as to the thridde poynt: that it kepeth fro vices
and diſpoſeth ſouereynly to getynge of vertues· preveth
wel in that the perfectioun of alle vertues is founden in
criſtes lyf.  For where ſchalt thow fynde ſo open enſample<EPB/><PB N="12" ID="pb.15"/>
and doctrine of ſouereyn charite / of perfite pouerte / of
profounde mekenes / of pacience and other vertues as in
the bleſſed lyf of Jeſu criſt?  Herfore ſeith ſeynt Bernard:
that he trauailleth in vayne aboute the getynge of vertues
who ſo hopeth to fynde hem owhere bot in the lorde of
vertues / whos lyf is the mirrour of temperaunce and alle
othere vertues.  Lo here grete comforte and gooſtly profiȝte
in deuouȝt contemplacioun of criſtes bleſſid lyf.  Wherfore
thou that coueyteſt to fele truly the fruyte of this

in that manere make the in thy ſoule preſent to tho thynges

herdeſt hem with thy bodily eeres / or ſeie hem with thyne
eiȝen done· pyttynge awey for the tyme and leuynge alle

of this book / that is the bleſſid lyf of Jeſu criſt / be at his
Incarnacioun· neuertheles we mowe firſte deuoutliche
ymagine and thenke ſomme thinges done byfore touching

Bot thanne was a queſtioun amonge the ſuſtres committed

it is ſkilful that as he conquered man by wicked ſleiȝte

than fallynge doun alle the holy ſpirites of heuene and

othere / that oure lady tolde to that ſame womman and ſeide
in this manere: Whan my fader and my moder laften me
in the temple I purpoſed and ſette ſtably in my herte to haue
god vnto my fader· and ofte ſithes with grete deuocioun
I thouȝt what I myȝt doo pleſynge to god· ſo that he
wolde vouche ſauf to ſende me his grace: and here with
I was tauȝt and I lerned the lawe of my lord god.  In the
whiche lawe / of alle the heſtes and byddynges / principally
I kepte thre in my herte.  The firſte is: Thou ſchalt loue
thy lord god with all thyn herte / with al thy ſoule / with
al thy mynde / and with al thy myȝt: the ſecound: Thow
ſchalt loue thy neiȝhebore as thy ſelf: and the thridde is:
Thou ſchalt hate thyn enemy.  Theſe thre I kepte trewely
in herte / and anon I conceyued and toke alle the vertues
that beth conteyned in hem.  For there may no ſoule haue
eny vertue but it loue god with alle the herte· for of this
loue cometh al the plente of grace: and after it is comen
it abideth nouȝt in the ſoule / bot renneth out as water bot
it ſo be that he hate his enemyes / that is to ſaie vices and
ſynnes.  Wherfore he that wole haue grace and kepe it /
it byhoueth that he diſpoſe and ordeyne his herte to loue
and to hate / as it is ſeide.  And ſo I wole that thou doo
in manere as I didde.  I roſe vp algate at mydnyȝt and<EPB/><PB N="21" ID="pb.24"/>
went forth byfore the auȝter of the temple / and there with
alſo grete deſire and wille and affeccioun as I kowthe and
myȝte / I aſked grace of all myȝty god to kepe tho thre
heſtes and alle othere biddynges of the lawe· and ſo ſtondynge
to fore the auȝter I made vij peticiouns to god / the
whiche ben theſe.  Firſt / I aſked grace of all myȝty god /
thoruȝ the whiche I myȝt fulfille the heſte of loue / that is
to ſay / forto loue hym with al my herte / &amp;c.;: the ſecounde /
I aſked that I myȝt loue myn neigheboure after his wil
and his likynge / and that he wolde make me to loue alle
that he loueth: the thridde / that he wolde make me to
hate and eſchewe alle thing that he hateth: the ferthe /
I aſked mekenes / pacience / benignyte / and ſwetteneſſe /
and alle othere vertues by the whiche I myȝt be gracioſe
and pleſynge to goddes ſiȝte: the fifte peticioun I made to
god / that he wolde lete me ſe the tyme in the whiche that
bleſſid mayden ſchulde be born that ſchulde conceiue and
bere goddes ſone· and that he wolde kepe myne eyȝen
that I myȝt ſee hire / myne eris that I myȝt here hir ſpeke /
my tunge that I myȝt preiſe hir / myne hondes that I myȝt

myne knees with the whiche I myȝte honoure and worſchippe
goddes ſone in hir barme.  In the ſixte peticioun
I aſked grace to be obeſiaunt to the biddynges and the
ordenaunces of the biſſhop of the temple.  And in the
ſeuenthe I prayde god to kepe all the peple to his ſeruiſe.</P><P>¶ And whan the forſeide womman / criſtes ſeruaunt /
had herd theſe wordes ſche ſeide aȝeyn: A / ſwete ladye /

to ſay outake the holy grace thoruȝ the whiche I was
halowed in my moder wombe.  And furthermore oure lady
ſeide: Wite thou wele in certeyne that there cometh none

affliccioun: and after that we haue ȝeuen to god tho thinges
that we mowen / though they ben litel and fewe / than
cometh he in to the ſoule / bryngynge with hym ſo grete

Alſo ſeynt Jerome / writynge of hir lyfe / ſeide in
this manere: that the bleſſed mayden marye ordeyned to
hir ſelf this manere of rule in lyuynge / that fro the morwe
into the tierce of the day ſche ȝaf hire all to prayeres· and
fro tierce in to none ſche occupied hir bodily with weuynge
werk· and efte fro none ſche went not fro prayeres til the
aungel of god come and appered to hir / of whos hande
ſche toke mete to the bodily ſuſtinaunce: and ſo ſche profited
algate bettre and bettre in the werk and in the loue
of god.  And ſo it byfel that ſche was founden in wakynge
the firſte / in the wiſdome of goddes lawe moſt kunnynge /
in mekenes moſt lowe / in the ſonges and the pſalmes of
dauid moſt conuenient and ſemeliche / in charite moſt gracious
/ in clenneſſe moſt clene / and in all manere vertue<EPB/><PB N="23" ID="pb.26"/>
moſt perfite.  Sche was ſad and invariable· ſo ferforth
that as ſche profited better and better / ſo was there none
that euere ſyhe or herde hir wrooth.  Alle hir ſpeche was
ſo ful of grace that god was knowen by here tonge.  Sche
was contynuelliche abidynge and dwellynge in prayere and

felawes that none of hem ſchulde treſpace or ſynne in any
word / and that none ſchulde lawhe diſſolutely / and alſo
that none of hem ſchulde offende other thoruȝ pryde or
any wrong.  And euere with oute faillynge ſche bleſſid god.
And leſt perchaunce by eny gretynge or preyſinge ſche
ſchulde be letted fro the louynges of god / what tyme eny

ſche toke of the aungels hande· and that mete that ſche

Euery day goddes aungelle ſpake with hir / and als he
ſchulde to his derworthe ſuſtre or moder / ſo he ſerued
and was obeiſaunt to hir.  Thus moche ſeith ſeynt Jerome
of hir lyf.  Furthermore in hir fourtenthe ȝere that bleſſed
mayden marye was wedded to Joſeph by the reuelacioun
of god· and thanne wente ſche home aȝen in to naȝareth·
als it is writen by proces in the ſtorie of hir natiuitie.</P><P>¶ But thus myche at this tyme ſuffiſeth to haue in

For thou ſchalt vndirſtonde that this bleſſed incarnacioun

gooſtly holy chirche· in the whiche Jeſu ſchal reigne in

and the worthynes of this bleſſid child Jeſu / to that
meke mayden marie / that was choſen to his moder· than
ſche ſpak firſt to the aungel / not dredynge of his wordes

to be certified more pleynly of that ſche dredde moſte /
that was that ſche ſchulde not leſe hir maydenhode / aſked

and aſſent of his bleſſid douȝter marye / takynge hede and

Lerne thou thenne by enſample of hir to be ſchamefaſt
vertuouſly and meke· for with oute theſe two vertues maydenhode
or virgynyte is litell worth.  For as ſeint Bernard
ſeith: Virgynyte is a faire vertue / but mekenes is a more
neceſſarie· for thou mayſt be ſauf with outen the firſte /
but with oute that othere / that is mekenes / thou maiſt not.
In ſo moche that I dar hardely ſaie that with oute mekenes
the virgynyte of marie had not ben pleſynge to god· for
bot marie had ben meke the holy goſt had not reſted vppon
hir / ſeithe ſeynt bernarde. At the laſte / as the ende of the
goſpel ſeith / the mylde mayden marye / whan ſche had
herd and wiſly vnderſtonden the aungels wordes / by good
aviſement ȝaf hir aſſent in this manere / as it is writen in
her reuelaciouns: ſche kneled doun with ſouereyn deuocioun

me and fulfilled after thy worde.  And ſo in thiſe meke
and lowe wordes of marye at the ende thou haſt enſaumple
of grete mekenes / as thou haddeſt in hir ſcilence at the bygynnynge.
Lo / ſche is choſen goddis moder / and of the
aungel cleped ful of grace: and ſche nempned hir ſelf his
honde mayden.  And no wonder / for / as ſeynt Bernard
ſeith / mekenes is euere wont to be felawe with the grace
of god· but this mekenes was not litel: for / as he ſeith /
it is not moche to preiſe mekenes in abieccioun / but it is
a grete vertue and ſelden ſeyn / mekenes in worſchippe.</P><P>¶ Alſo ſone thenne as ſche had ȝeuen hir anſwere and
aſſented in the wordes forſeide / anone with oute dwellynge
goddis ſone entred into hir wombe· and thoruȝ worchynge
of the holy gooſt was made man in verray fleſche and blood
taken of hir body· and not as othere children / conceyued

and after the ſoule ſched in to the body· but anone at the
firſte inſtaunce he was ful ſchapen in alle membres and
alle hole man in body and in ſoule· but neuertheles ful
lite in quantite: for after he waxed more and more
kyndely as othere children done.  So that at the firſte he
was ful perfite god and man / as wiſe and as myȝty as he
is nowe.  And whan this was done / Gabriel / knelynge
doun with oure lady / and ſone aftir with hir riſynge vp /
toke curteiſly his leue of hir with a deuouȝt and lowe bowynge

his ſymple clothinge conforteth not hem that gone

of the whiche ſeynt Bernard ſeith thus: Goddes ſone whan

And ſithen criſt that is not begiled chas that is moſt hard
to the fleſche / ſothely that is beſt / moſt profitable / and
rather to be choſen· and who ſo techeth or biddeth othere
he is as a falſe deceyuere to be fledde and forſaken.  Al
this ſeith ſeynt Bernard.  And thus myche of theſe vertues
at this tyme.</P><P>¶ Goo we nowe furthermore to ſpeke of the forſeide

This day / as holy chirche ſyngeth in the office of the
maſſe / after the prophecie of yſaie / a child is borne to vs
that is like to vs in his manhede· and a ſone is ȝeuen to
vs that is euene to the fader of heuene in his godhede.
Alſo this day the ſonne of riȝtwiſneſſe / that was firſt vnder
cloude / ſprang openly his bemes of mercy and the liȝt of
his grace in alle the world.  And ſo this day was ſeien
that bleſſed newe ſiȝt that neuere ere was ſeien in erthe /

and vertue therof ſeynt Bernard ſpeketh deuoutly by proceſſe

was done this day worthy to be had in mynde is that this
day oure lord Jeſu bygan to ſcheden his precious blood
for oure ſake.  He bygan be tyme to ſuffre for vs / and he
that neuere did ſynne bygan this day to bere peyne in his
ſwete tender body for oure ſynne.  Myche ouȝte we to
haue compaſſioun and wepe with hym / for he wepte this

we ſchulde make moche merthe and be ioyful for oure
hele· and alſo haue ynward compaſſioun and ſorwe for
the peynes and angwiſche that he ſuffred for vs.  For as
it is ſeide bifore / this day he ſched his blood whan that /

wepte for the ſorwe that he felte there thoruȝ in his

to hem the trauaile of two monthes and more.  And that

Lorde / hou did thei there of hir liflode? or where reſted

thei that weren ſo noble and ſo worthy.  Alſo in this
forſeide proceſſe ȝif we take goode hede we mowe ſee
many goode enſaumples and notable doctrines to vs.
Firſte / ȝif we take hede hou oure lord Jeſu toke in his

he was magnified to the hirde men as god / and honoured

we ſee here the aungeles apperynge and ſpekynge of the

to god / neuertheles the apperynges of the aungel and the
reuelaciouns were not done to hym openly and in wakynge /
bot in manere of dremes and in his ſleping.</P><P>¶ The thridde notable thing that we haue enſaumple of
here is how that oure lord ſuffreth his derlynges to be
diſeſed here thoruȝ perſecuciouns and tribulaciouns· and
that ſcheweth wele here in marye and Joſeph.  What tyme
they knewen the child ſouȝte to be ſlayne· what myȝt
they here more ſorwefulle?  For thouȝ it ſo were that thei
knewen and wiſten wele that he was goddes ſone / neuertheles
the ſenſualite and the reſoun of hem myȝte kyndely
be deſtourbeled and meued to ſeie in this manere: Lord
god / fader all myȝty / what nede is it to thy bleſſed ſone /
that here is to flee / as thou myȝteſt not defende hym fro
his enemyes and kepe hym ſaaf here?  And alſo her
tribulacioun and diſeſe was in ſo moche the more that
hem byhoued to goo in to ſoo fer a londe that they knewe
not / and that by hard weies and noyouſe· ſithen they
were moche vndiſpoſed to goynge and trauaillynge / oure
lady for ȝouthe and tenderneſſe / and Joſeph for elde and
febilneſſe.  And alſo the childe that they ſchulde bere and
carie was vnnethe two monthes olde· and ȝit herewith
they ȝeden in to that londe / in the whiche thei as pore
and vnknowen had noȝt to helpe hem ſelf with.  Alle thiſe
diſeſes weren to hem mater of grete tribulacioun and
affliccioun· and therfore / thou that ſuffreſt here tribulacioun
kepe therynne pacience / and loke not to haue here
of a pryuelege of hym that wolde not take hit hym ſelf / ne
ȝeue it his moder.</P><P>¶ The ferthe notable thing that we mowe conſidre here
is the grete benignyte and mercy of oure lorde· for there
as he myȝte anone in a moment had deſtroyed his enemyes
that purſued hym· ȝit wolde he not / but benignely and<EPB/><PB N="68" ID="pb.71"/>
ſwetely he chaſe rathere to flee / and ȝeue ſtede for the
tyme to the malice and the woodneſſe of that wicked
herode / than to be venged as he myȝt riȝtwiſly of him.
And this was a profounde mekenes and a grete pacience.
In the ſame manere ſchulde we doo· that is to ſaie / not
wilfully withſtonde and ſeke vengeaunce of hem that done
wronges and purſue vs / but paciently for the tyme bere
hem and flee her malice· and more ouer ſpecially pray
for hem / as god techeth vs alſo in another place of the
goſpel to do to oure enemyes.</P><P>¶ Furthermore as to the proceſſe of the fleinge of Jeſu
with his moder and Joſeph.  Whan they comen to Egipt /
anone at the firſte entre alle the mawmettes of that londe
fellen a downe / as it was prophecied bifore by the prophete
yſaye.  And than wente they to a citee of that londe
that hiȝte lymopolus· and there they hired hem ſomme
ſymple hous / where they dwelleden vii ȝere / as pilgrymes
and ſtraungeres / pore and nedy.  Here mowe we deuouȝtly
ymagyne and thenke of the manere of liuynge of hem in
that vnkouthe lond· and how oure lady wrouȝt for hir
liflode / that is to ſeie with nedele ſewynge and ſpynnynge /
as it is writen of hir· and alſo Joſeph / worchynge in his
craft of carpuntrie· and how the child / bleſſed Jeſu / after
he cam to the age of fyue ȝere or there aboute / ȝede on
hir erandes and halpe in that he myȝte / as a pore child /
to hem ſchewynge in alle his dedes buxomeneſſe / lowenes /
and mekenes.  And ſithen hem byhoued to gete her
lyflode in that manere with her trauaille / and perauenture
with repreue ofte ſithes of hem that they dwelled among /
as it falleth comounly to ſtraungeres / and alſo with ſchame·
what hope we of her houſehold / as of beddynge / clothinge
and othere neceſſaries? whether they hadden in this ſuperfluite
or curioſite?  Nay / with outen dowte thei that<EPB/><PB N="69" ID="pb.72"/>
loueden perfiȝte pouerte wolde noȝt haue / thouȝ thei myȝte /
that that is contrarie to pouerte / as is ſuperfluyte and
curioſite.  And nameliche touchynge curioſite / trowe we
that oure lady in hir ſowynge / or othere manere worchinge /
made curious werkes as moche folk doth?  Nay / god
forbede· for thouȝ they worchen ſuche curioſitees that
taken non hede to leſen the tyme / ſche that was in that
nede myȝte not / nor wolde noȝt / ſpende the tyme in veyne
as manye done / nameliche in thiſe daies.  For thiſe vice
of curioſite is one the moſte perilous vice that is / and that
by many ſkilles may be ſchewed.  Firſte / by leſynge of
tyme that is ordeyned to the worſchippe of god· for ſuche
curiouſe werk occupieth moche more tyme than wolde
othere pleyne and ſymple werk do that were ſufficiant to
the nede· and that is a grete harme and contrarie to
goddis wille.</P><P>¶ The ſecounde harme that cometh of curioſite is cauſe
and matere of veyne ioye to the worchere· as what tyme
that a man maketh ſuche a curious werk ofte loketh he
theron with likynge / and thinketh and ymagyneth in his
thouȝt beſily· alſo whan he worcheth noȝt / and ſpecially
in tyme of goddes ſeruice and whan he ſchulde haue his
herte to god / thinketh or ſpeketh forto make that curious
werk and therby halt him ſelf ſubtile and witty / and ſo
wolde be ſeyn paſſynge othere.</P><P>¶ Alſo it is cauſe of pride to hym that the curiouſe
werk is made too· for as ſymple / pleyne / and buſtouſe
werkes ben occaſioun of lowenes and mekenes· ſo ben
curiouſe werkes as oyle noryſſhynge the fire of pride in
the holderes and haueres of hem.</P><P>¶ Alſo it is to hem that hauen likynge in ſuche curioſites
matere forto drawe hir hertes fro god and heuenly thinges·
for as ſeynt gregory ſeith: In alſo moche as a man hath<EPB/><PB N="70" ID="pb.73"/>
delite here bynethe in erthely thinges / in ſo moche he
is departed fro the loue aboue of heuenly thinges.</P><P>¶ Alſo is it one of the thre by the whiche all the worlde
is infecte in ſynne / that is the foule luſt of the eyȝen· for
ſuche curioſitees ſeruen of noȝt elles but forto fede the
eiȝen: and alſo ofte as a man likyngly and in veyne with
ſuche curioſite fedeth his eiȝen / ſo ofte the maker and the
vſere offendeth god.</P><P>¶ Wherfore men ſchulde eſchewe to make ſuche curioſites
for ȝeuynge occaſioun of ſynne.  For a man ſchulde not
aſſente to ſynne for eny cauſe / bot in alle manere abſtene
ſro the offence of god· and ſithen god ȝaf enſaumple and
commendeth and loueth pouerte / as it is ofte ſeide / with
oute dowte it foloweth that he is gretly offended in that
thinge that is directe contrarie to pouerte / that is ſpecially
curioſite.  Alſo with alle othere harmes more ouer this is /
that it is a token of a veyne and a liȝt and an vnſtable
herte and ſoule.  Wherfore he that wole liue in clenneſſe
of conſcience and withoute defoylynge of his ſoule / hym
byhoueth to abſteyne hym bothe fro the makynge and
alſo fro the vſynge of ſuche veyne curioſitees / and to flee
therefro as fro a venemous ſerpent.  Neuertheles by this
forſaide reproof of curioſite we ſchulle not vnderſtonde
generally forbeden to make faire werkes and honeſte
apparaille· for that is leueful ſo that it kepe a gode
mene / and namely in tho thynges and werkes that longen
to goddes ſeruice.  In the whiche it is nedefulle to be
warre and to eſchewe alle corupte entente of veyne ioye
or glorie / and alle falſe affecciouns and foule likynges
of worldes vanyte· ſo that the vertues mene of ſufficient
honeſte paſſe not in to the exceſſe of viciouse curioſite.

he went to the cuntre of galilee in to the citee of Naȝareth.</P><P>¶ Here mowe we ſee in the comynge aȝeyn of Jeſu / as
it was ſeide in his goynge / drede and diſeſe menged with
comforte and eſe. For what tyme thei / beynge in a ſtraunge
londe / herde of the deth of her enemyes / and that thei
ſchulde come aȝeyne in to her owne londe / no doute but
that it was grete comforte and hope of eeſe· but takynge
hede therwith to the hard trauaille by the wey / and after
whan that they comen in to hir owne londe in hope of pees
tithinges of a newe enemy come to hem and for drede of
hym beden to eſchewe his cuntrey / there was diſcomfort
and diſeſe.  And alle to oure lore / as it is ſeide.  Lorde
Jeſu / thou faire ȝonge childe that art lord and king of
heuene and erthe / what diſeſe and what trauaille ſuffredeſt
thou for oure ſake / and how ſone thou bygan!  Sothely
wele ſpake the prophete in ȝoure perſone whan he ſeith thus:
I am pore and in dyuerſe trauailes from my firſte ȝowthe.
Swete Jeſu / how ȝedeſt thou· or was caried al that longe
and harde weie / and namely thoruȝ that horrible deſerte·<EPB/><PB N="72" ID="pb.75"/>
paſſynge ouer the rede ſee / and alſo the flode Jordan / in ſo
tender age! For as it ſemeth / this aȝeyne comynge is more
trauailous and more noyous to the and to thy lederes than
was thy firſte goinge· for why that tyme thou were ſo litel
that thou myȝteſt eſily be borne in armes· but now thou
art elder and more woxen / as in the tyme of vij ȝere thou
myȝt not ſoo / and goo myche myȝt thou nouȝt for tendre

that al only this trauaile that we ſpeken now of were
ſufficient vnto ful redempcioun for mankynde.  Furthermore
as to the proceſſe of her wey: we mowe thenke that
what tyme they comen toward the ende of that deſerte
there they founden John Baptiſte / the whiche that tyme
there hadde bygunne forto lyuen in deſerte / penaunce
doynge / thouȝ it ſo were that he had no ſynne penaunce
worthy.  For / as it is ſeide / that place of Jordane in the
whiche John baptiȝed is that ſame place wherby the
children of Iſrael ȝeden drye fote whan they comen by
that deſerte oute of Egipte / and that nyhe that place in
deſerte John lyued in penaunce.  Wherfore it is likly that
Jeſu and his moder founden hym there / and that they
maden grete ioye and goſtely myrthe comynge to gidre·
and no wonder / for he was an excellent and a worthy
childe fro his firſte birthe.  He was the firſte heremyte
and the biginning of religious lyuynge in the newe lawe:
he was clene mayden and gretteſt prechour after criſt: he
was a prophete and more than a prophete / and a precious
and a glorious martir.  Wherfore we deuoutly honourynge
and worſchippynge hym / take we oure leue of hym at
this tyme / and goo we forth with oure lord Jeſu and his
moder in the forſeide wey.</P><P>¶ After they were paſſed the flome Jordan / than come
they ſurthermore to the houſe of oure lady coſyne Eliȝabeth /<EPB/><PB N="73" ID="pb.76"/>
where they weren ſpecially refreſched and maden to gidre
a grete and a likynge feſte.  And there Joſeph / herynge
that Archelaus regned after his fader herode in the cuntre
cleped Judea / by biddynge of the aungel / as it ſeide bifore /
went with the child and his moder in to the citee of galile
cleped Naȝareth· and there they dwelleden as in her owne
home / ledynge a ſymple and a pore lyf to gedre / bot in
that grete goſtly richeſſe of charite.  Loo thus is the child
Jeſu broȝt home oute of Egipte.  And than as we mowen
thynke the ſiſtres of oure lady and othere kynnes folk and
frendes comen to hem / welcomynge hem home and viſitynge
hem / with preſentis and ȝiftes / as it was nede to
hem that founden of her owne bare houſholde.  Alſo
among othere we mowe ſpecially haue in mynde that John
euangeliſte come with his moder / oure lady ſiſter / to viſite
and ſee Jeſu / the whiche John was that tyme aboute
fyue ȝere olde· for / as it is writen of hym / he deide the
ȝere fro the paſſioun of oure lorde lxti and vij / that was the
ȝere of his age xc and viij· ſo that at the paſſioun of criſt
he hadde in elde one and thretty ȝere / and criſt hym ſelf
xxxiij or litel more: and ſo at this aȝeyne comynge of
Jeſu / that was than vij ȝere olde / John was fyue ȝere
olde.  And as he was after / amonge othere choſen apoſtles
and diſciples / ſpecially biloued of oure lord Jeſu / ſo it is
likly that in this tyme of her childehode he was more
chere than othere / and as moſt ſpecial pley fere to Jeſu.
Fro this tyme vnto the xij ȝere of Jeſu his age the goſpel
maketh none mynde of the childe Jeſu.  Neuertheles it
is writen and ſeide that there is ȝit in that place a welle
wherof the child Jeſu fette ofte ſithes water to his moder·
for that meke lorde refuſed not to doo ſuche lowe ſeruices

thou knoweſt that art my hope / my lyf / and alle my

and by ſuche wordes / as we mowe deuoutely ſuppoſe /
al that nyȝt the moder cared and prayed for hir dere ſone.
After vppon the morwe erly / marie and Joſeph ſouȝten
hym by othere dyuers weies that ladden to Jeruſalem·
and furthermore ſouȝten hym beſily among her frendes
and kynneſmen: but they myȝte not here of hym.  Wherfore
his moder was ſo ſory that ſche myȝte in none manere
be conforted.  But the thridde day after / whan they comen
in to Jeruſalem and ſouȝten hym at the temple / there they
founden him ſittynge amonge doctoures of lawe / heryng

anon as oure lady had the ſiȝt of hym / ſche was alſo glad
as ſche had ben torned fro deth to lyue· and therwith

And alſo ſone as the child Jeſu ſawh his moder / he wente

in hir armes / and kyſſynge hym ofte ſithes / and haldynge

til ſche had taken ſpirite / and than ſche ſpake to hym
and ſeide: Dere ſone / what haſt thou done to vs in this

ȝe not wele that it byhoueth me to be occupied in tho
thinges that longen to the worſchippe of my fader?  But
thiſe wordes they vnderſtood not in that tyme.  And than
ſeide his moder: Sone / wolt thow not gone home aȝen with
vs?  And he mekely anſwerynge ſeide: I wole doo as
ȝe wole that I doo / and as it is pleſynge to ȝow.  And ſo
was he ſuget to hem / and went home aȝeyne with hem
in to hir citee Naȝareth.</P><P>¶ In this forſeide proces of Jeſu what hope we that he
didde? or where and in what manere lyued he tho thre
dayes? We mowe ſuppoſe that he went to ſomme hoſpitale
of pore men· and there he ſchamefaſtly prayed and aſked
herberwe / and there ete and lay with pore men as a pore
child.  And ſome doctoures ſeien that he begged in thoo
thre dayes / but therof litel forſe ſo that we folwe hym in
perfiȝte mekenes and othere vertues· for begginge withoute
forthe but there be a meke herte withynne forth is litel
worth as to perfectioun.</P><P>¶ Furthermore in the forſeide proces we mowe note
and lerne thre profitable thinges to vs.  Firſte is that he
that wole perfitely ſerue god ſchal not dwelle amonge his
fleſchely frendes and kynneſmen / bot he moſte leue hem
and goo fro hem.  In token where of the child Jeſu lafte
his owne dere moder what tyme he wolde ȝeue tente to
the gooſtly werkes of his fader· and alſo whan he was
ſowht among his frendes and kenneſmen he was not<EPB/><PB N="78" ID="pb.81"/>
founden there in that tyme.  The ſecounde is that he
that ledeth gooſtly lyf wonder not moche / ne be not diſcomforted
ouere heuely / thouȝ he be ſom tyme ſo drie in
ſoule / and as voyde of deuocioun as he were forſake of
god.  For this manere byfelle to goddes moder / as it is
ſeide bifore.  Wherefore be he not in deſpeire therby /
bot beſilich ſeche he Jeſu in holy meditaciouns and gode
werkes / and ſpecially in deuoute prayeres / and he ſchal
fynde hym at the laſte in dewe tyme.  The thridde is that
a man folowe not to moche his owne will or his owne
witt.  For oure lorde Jeſu after he ſeide that hym byhoued
to be occupied in tho thinges that longed to his fader
worſchippe· after he lafte that propir wille and folowede
his parens wille / goynge forth with hem fro the temple
home in to Naȝareth / and was ſugett to hem.  And this
is aſpecially nedefulle to religious folke to folowe by trewe
obedience to her ſouereynes: and alſo here we haue grete
enſaumple of mekenes in oure lord Jeſu / wherof we ſchole
trete more pleynely in the chapitre that next foloweth.</P></DIV2><DIV2 NODE="LoveMirrour:6.4" TYPE="chapter" ID="DIV1.22"><HEAD>¶Cam.xiijm.<LB/>¶ What manere of leuynge oure lord Jeſu hadde / and

to Naȝareth with his parens / whan he was xij
ȝere olde / as it is ſeide bifore / vnto his thrittythe
ȝere we fynde not expreſſed in ſcripture autentike
what he didde / or how he lyued· and that ſemeth ful
wonderfulle.  What ſchulle we than ſuppoſe of hym in
al this tyme?  Whether he was in ſo mochel idel that he
did nouȝt / or wroȝt nouȝt thing that were worthy to be
writen and ſpoken of?  God ſchylde!  And on the tother
ſide / ȝif he didde and wrouȝt thing that were worthy to be<EPB/><PB N="79" ID="pb.82"/>
writen and ſpoken / why is it not writen as othere dedes
of hym bene? Sothely it ſemeth merveylous and wonderfull.
But neuertheles / ȝif we wole here take good entent /
we ſchul mowe ſee that as in noȝt doynge he didde grete
thynges and wonderfull· for there is no thing of his dedes /
or tyme of his leuynge / with oute miſterie and edificacioun.
But as he ſpake and wrouȝt vertuouſly in tyme / ſo he helde
his pees and reſted and with drowe hym vertuouſly in tyme.
Wherfore he that was ſouereyne maiſtre / and came to
teche vertues and ſchewe the trewe weie of euerlaſtynge
lyf / he bygan fro his ȝouthe to doo wonderful dedes /
and that in a wonderfull manere / and vnknowen and
that was neuer ere herde bifore: that is to ſeie / ſchewynge
hym ſelf in that tyme as idel and vnkunnynge and abiecte
in the ſiȝt of men in manere as we ſchal ſeie aftir: not fully
affermynge in this or othere that we mowe not openly
proue by holy writt or doctryne appreved / bot deuoutely
ymagynynge to edificacioun and ſtirynge of deuocioun·
as it was ſeide in the proheme of this book at the bigynnynge.
And ſo we ſuppoſe that oure lorde Jeſu in that
tyme with drowe hym fro the companye and the felawſchippe
of men / and wente ofte tymes to the ſynagoge
as to chirche· and there was he myche occupied in
prayer / but not in the hiȝeſte and moſt worſchipful place /
but in the loweſt and priuyeſt place.  And after in tyme
whan he come home halpe his moder / and alſo perauenture
his ſuppoſed fader Joſeph in his craft· comynge and
goynge amonge men as he knewe not men.  Alle that
knewen hym of the comoun peple that he dwelled among /
and ſeien ſo faire and ſo ſemely a ȝong man doynge no
thing that was in to preiſynge or magnifieng of his name /
wondred gretely of hym / namely for as the goſpell ſeith
of hym whan he was ȝong and of xij ȝere age: Jeſu profited<EPB/><PB N="80" ID="pb.83"/>
in age and in wiſdom and in grace to fore god and man·
that is to ſeie / as in the ſiȝt and the opinioun of men.
But nowe whan he was of more age in to the tyme of his
thrittythe ȝere he ſchewed none dedes of commendacioun
outeward· wherefore men ſkorned hym / and helde hym
as an ydiote and an ydel man and a fole: and ſo it was
his wille to be holde as vnworthy and abiecte to the world
for oure ſauacioun / as the prophete ſpeketh in his perſone
thus: I am a worme and not a man· reproue of men and
abieccioun of peple.  But here mowe we ſee that he in
that abieccioun / as it were noȝt doynge / didde a ful grete
vertuouſe dede of worthy commendynge· and what was
that?  Sothely that he made hym ſelf foule and abiecte
in the ſiȝt of othere· and here of had he no nede / but we
hadde this nede: for ſothely as I trowe in alle oure dedes
there is no thing gretter or harder to fulfille than is this.
Wherfore as me thynketh that man is comen to the hiȝeſt
and the hardeſt degre of perfeccioun / the whiche of ful
hert and trewe will / withoute feynynge / hath ſo ouercome
hym ſelf and maiſtered the proude ſterynge of the fleſche
that he willeth not to be in reputacioun of men· but
coueiteth fully to be deſpiſed and holde as foule / vnworthy
/ and abiecte.  For this is more worthy and more
to commende than a man to be paſſyngly ſtrong and
a conquerour of citees and londes / as Salamon witneſſith.
Wherfore til we come to this degre of perfeccioun we
ſchulle holde oure ſelf as ful inperfite / and al that we
done as nouȝt to acounte.  For ſithen / in ſotheneſſe / alle
we bene but as vnworthy ſeruauntes what tyme that we
done the goode that we oweth to doo / as god hym ſelf
witneſſith / til the tyme that we come to this degre of
abieccioun and perfite reproue of oure ſelue we ben not
ſette ſadly in truthe / bot rathere in vanitee· as the apoſtil<EPB/><PB N="81" ID="pb.84"/>
openly ſcheweth in thiſe wordes: Who ſo halte hym ſelf
in his owne reputacioun as ouȝte worthy / ſithen in ſotheneſſe
he is as noȝt / he bygileth and deceyueth hym ſelf.
And ſo as we ſeide bifore / oure lorde Jeſu lyued in this
manere and made hym ſelf abiecte and as vnworthy to the
world not for his owne nede / but forto teche vs the trewe
wey of perfeccioun.  Wherfore ȝif we lerne it noȝt we
mowe not be excuſed· for it is an abhominable thing
to ſee him that is bot as a worme and wormes mete to
come forto hiȝe hym ſelf by preſumpcioun / and lifte vp
hym ſelf as ouȝte / whan that hiȝe lorde of maieſte ſo
meked hym ſelf by abiectioun / and lowed hym ſelf as
noȝt.  And that didde he noȝt by feynynge / bot as he
was ſothely meke and mylde in herte.  So alſo with oute
eny ſymulacioun he lowed hym ſelf in all manere of mekenes
and abiectioun in the ſiȝte of othere: fulfillynge firſt
in dede that he tauȝte after by word / whan he bad his
diſciples to lerne of hym forto be meke and mylde in
herte.  And in ſo moche he lowed and anentiſſhed hym
ſelf / that alſo after he bygan to preche and to ſpeke ſo
hiȝe thinges of the godhede / as the goſpell telleth / and
to worche myracles and wondres· ȝet the Jewes ſette
noȝt by hym / bot deſpiſed hym and ſkorned hym / ſeienge:
What is he this? Is not he that wriȝtes ſone Joſeph?
And alſo: In the deueles name he caſteth oute deueles.
And many othere ſuche deſpites and repreues he ſuffred
paciently and mekely / makynge ſo there thoruȝ a ſwerde
of mekenes there with to ſlee the proude aduerſarie the
deuel of helle.  And ȝif we wole ſee hou myȝtily he girde
hym with this ſwerde of mekenes / after the biddynge
of the prophete / lete vs take good hede to alle his dedes
and we ſchulle ſee in hem algate ſchewed grete mekeneſſe·
as we mowe ſee ȝif we haue in mynde in alle the proceſſe<EPB/><PB N="82" ID="pb.85"/>
that is ſeide ȝitt hider to· and alſo here after ſchal be
ſchewed more and more into his harde deth / and more
ouer aftir his reſurreccioun / and at his vpſtiȝenge to

whan he ſchal ſitte in his maieſte kyng and domeſman
of alle the worlde.  ȝit ſchal he ſchewe his ſouereyn
mekenes / clepynge his creatures his bretheren by theſe
wordes: Als longe as ȝe didde almes dedes to theſe my
leeſt bretheren / ȝe didden to me.</P><P>¶ And why hope we that he ſchewed ſo myche and
loued principally this vertue of mekenes?  Sothely for
he knewe wele that as the bigynnynge of alle ſynne is
pride / ſo the foundement of alle gode and of ſauacioun is
mekenes· with oute the whiche foundement the bildynge
of alle othere vertues is in veyne.  And therfore ȝif we

to his euene like in eſtate / and not to be hiȝed or preferred
aboue his vnderlynge.  The thridde and the ſouereyne
degree of mekenes is: to be ſugett and lowed to his vnderlynge
/ that is he that is laſſe in eſtate than he.  And this
degre kept oure lord Jeſu at this tyme whan he meked

none of his owne ſynnes / for he had none / but oure
filthes and oure ſynnes: and ſo weddynge there goſtly
to hym holy chirche generally and alle trewe ſoules
ſpecially· for in the feithe of oure bapteme we ben
wedded to oure lord Jeſu criſte.  Wherfore this is a grete
feſte and a werk of grete profite and excellence· for in<EPB/><PB N="88" ID="pb.91"/>
this worthy werk all the holy trinite was opounely ſchewed
in a ſinguler manere.</P><P>¶ Whan the holy gooſt come downe in the liknes of
a dowfe and reſted vppon hym / and the vois of the fader
ſeide: This is my byloued ſone / in whom it liketh me

worde ſeynt Bernard ſpeketh in this manere: Loo lord
Jeſu / now is tyme to ſpeke / and therfore now bygynne
and ſpeke.  How longe wilt thou be in ſilence?  Me
thynke thou haſt longe tyme holde thy pees· ȝe and ful
longe: bot now ſpeke / for now thou haſt leue of the

and the wiſdome of the fader / be hidde in the peple as
he that were feble and vnkunnynge?  Hou longe thou /
that art the worthy kyng of heuen / ſuffreſt thy ſelf to
be cleped and alſo to be ſuppoſed and holden a wryȝtes

witneſſeth / ȝit in to this tyme of his xxx ȝere Jeſu was

that arte the vertue of criſte / hou myche confoundeſt

of men· whether he dredde ouȝte veyne ioye?  What
ſchulde he dredde veyne ioye that was in ſotheneſſe the
ioye of the fader?  But neuertheles he dredde this not

nede to be adredde of that veyne ioye.  And in that he
ſpake not with his mouth / he tauȝt vs in dede· and<EPB/><PB N="89" ID="pb.92"/>
that thing that he tauȝte after by worde / nowe he ſpake
by enſaumple· that is: Lerneth of me / for I am mylde
and meke in herte.  For of the ȝouthe of oure lorde in
to this tyme of xxxti ȝere I here or rede but litel more.
But now may he no lenger be hidde / ſithen he is ſo
opounly ſchewed of the fader.  Alle thiſe ben the wordes
of ſeint Bernard in ſentence / confermynge that was ſeide
bifore in the next chapitre· hou that oure lord Jeſu
mekely hilde his pees in to this tyme / for oure doctrine
to fle preſumpcioun and kepe perfiȝte mekenes.  The
which vertue ȝit here in his bapteme he ſchewed more
growen than it was byfore· by ſouereyne loweneſſe openly
ſchewed to his ſeruaunt / makynge hym worthy and grete
and him ſelf as vnworthy and abiecte.  And alſo in an
othere poynt we mowe ſee his mekenes here growen· for
in to this tyme / as it is ſeide / he lyued lowely as in
idelneſſe and in abiectioun· but now he ſchewed hym
ſelf openly as a ſynful man.  For John preched to ſynful
men to do penaunce / and baptiſed hem· and oure lord
Jeſu cam among hem / and in her ſiȝt was baptiſed as
one of hem.  And that was a ſouereyn poynte of mekenes
namely in this tyme / whan he purpoſed to preche and
ſchewe hym ſelf as goddes ſone.  For as by weie of
mannis reſoun he ſchulde haue dredde than of that lowe
dede / leſte therby after whan he preched he ſchulde
haue be in laſſe reputacioun and deſpiſed as a ſynful man
and vnworthy.  But therfore lafte not he that was maiſtre
of mekenes to meke hym ſelf in alle manere of loweneſſe
to oure doctryne and enſaumple / ſchewyng him ſelf thing
that he was not in to deſpite and abieccioun of hym ſelf·
bot we in contrarie manere ſchewen oure ſelf that we be
not in to worſchippe and preiſynge of oure ſelf / for ȝif
there be eny thing in vs of vertue that oweth to be preiſed<EPB/><PB N="90" ID="pb.93"/>
that gladly we ſchewen and maken knowe.  But oure
defauȝtes and treſpaces we helen and hiden / and ȝit be
we in ſothenes wicked and ſynfull· and thouȝ it ſo be
that we knowen oure ſelf as in oure owne ſiȝt vnworthy
and ſynful / neuertheles we wolde noȝt be holde ſo in the
ſiȝt of othere.  And in that is oure mekenes fer fro the
perfite mekenes of Jeſu / as it was here and bifore ſchewed /
and in alle his dedes he ſchewed it as that vertue that is
moſte nedefulle to vs.  Wherfore loue we it and beſy
we vs principally in alle oure dedes to kepe it / not
dredynge thereby to be the more vnable to profite of
othere.  For as he was in this tyme of his ſouereyn

and fourty nyȝtes / noȝt etynge or drynkynge· and / as
the euangeliſte Marke telleth / his dwellynge was there
with beeſtes.  Now ȝeue we here good entente to oure
lord Jeſu ſpecially and to his dedes· for here he techeth
vs and ȝeueth vs enſaumple of many grete vertues: as in
that that he is here ſolitarie / and faſteth / and prayeth /
and waketh / and lieth and ſlepeth vppon the erthe / and
mekely is conuerſaunt with beſtes.  In the whiche proces
ben touched foure thinges that longen ſpecially to gooſtly
exerciſe and vertuous lyuynge / and that wonderfully
helpen eche othere to gidre: that is to ſaie / ſolitarie
beynge / faſtynge / prayere / and penaunce of the body.
By the whiche we mowe come beſte to that noble vertue /
that is clennes of herte· the whiche clennes we oweth
ſouerenly to deſire / in alſo moche as it is mooſt nedefulle
to vs / and comprehendeth in it ſelfe alle othere vertues /
in manere that is to ſaye charitee / mekeneſſe / pacience /
and alle othere vertues.  And alſo it putteth away alle
vices· for with vices / or with defaute of vertues / clannes
of herte may not ſtonde and laſte· and therfore in that
book that is cleped <FOREIGN>Collaciones patrum</FOREIGN> it is ſeide that all
the exerciſe of a monke ſchulde be principally to gete
and haue clenneſſe of herte: and no wonder / for there
by a man ſchal deſerue to ſee god / as criſt hym ſelf
witteneſſeth in the goſpel / ſeieng thus: Bliſſed be the
clene in herte / for they ſchullen ſee god.  And as ſeint
Bernard ſeith: the clenner that a man is / the nerre he
is god / and the more clerely ſeeth hym.  Wherfore
to geten and haue this noble vertue / that is to ſeie
clenneſſe of herte / principally helpeth beſy and deuoute
prayere / of the whiche we ſchul ſpeke after.  But for as
moche as prayere with glotonye / or with luſte and the
likynge of the body / and ydelneſſe / is litel worth· therfore<EPB/><PB N="92" ID="pb.95"/>
it byhoueth that there be therwith faſtynge and
bodely penaunce· and that with diſcrecioun / for bodily
penaunce with oute diſcrecioun letteth alle goode werkes.
Alſo for the kepynge and fulfillynge of alle tho thre
forſeide thinges helpeth moche the ferthe· that is ſolitarie
beynge / for with moche noyſe and turblynge prayer
wil not wele and deuoutly be ſeide.  And he that ſeeth
and hereth many thinges ſchal ful harde eſkape vnclenneſſe
of herte and offenſe of conſcience· for ofte ſithes
deth entreth by oure wyndowes in to the ſoule.  Wherfore
thou that wilt be knytt goſtly to oure lord Jeſu criſt / and
coueyteſt in clennes of herte to ſee god / by enſaumple
of hym goo into ſolitarie place· and in alſo moche as
thou maiſt / ſauynge thyn eſtate / fle the companye of
fleſchely men· ſeke not by curioſite newe knowelecches
and frendſchippes· fille not thyn eiȝen and thyn eeres
with veyne fantaſies: for it was nouȝt with oute cauſe that
holy fadres here bifore ſouȝten deſertes and other ſolitarie
places fer fro the comoun converſacioun of men· and alſo
it was nouȝt for not that they tauȝten and beden hem that
dwelled in religious congregacioun that thei ſchulde be
blynde / defe / and doumbe· and therfore alle that may
lette and diſtourble reſte of ſoule flee as venemouſe to
the ſoule.  This ſolitarie beynge and this fleynge / as ſeint
Bernard ſeith / is more vertuouſly in ſoule than in body:
that is to ſaie / that a man in his entencioun / in deuocioun
and in ſpirite / be departed fro the world and men /
and ioyned ſo in ſpirite to god / that is a ſpirite and aſketh
not ſolitarie beynge of body bot in manere and in tyme /
as ſpecially in tyme of ſpecial prayer and alſo in other
tyme / of hem that owen by wey of her degre to be ſolitarye
/ as recluſe and ſome religiouſe.  And therfore ſeith
the ſame ſeynte: Thou that art among many bodily / thou<EPB/><PB N="93" ID="pb.96"/>
maiſt be ſolitarie and alone goſtly ȝif thou will not and
loue not theſe worldely thinges that the comunalte loueth·

ſolitarie in body / thou art not allone trewely in ſoule: and
generally in what manere companye of men that thow
art conuerſaunt be warre ſpecially of tweie thinges / ȝif thou
wilt be truly ſolitarie in ſpirite· that is that thou be noȝt
a beſy and curious ſercher of othere mennis conuerſacioun /
or elles a preſumptuouſe and temerarie demere of othere
men.  This is ſeynt Bernardes ſentence of ſolitarie beyng·
by the whiche we mowe vnderſtonde that bodily ſolitude
ſuffiſeth not with oute goſtly· but for to haue the goſtly
the bodily helpeth ful moche / puttynge away occaſioun
with outeforth that myȝte drawe the ſoule with ynneforth
fro the onynge and knyttynge to hir ſpouſe Jeſu criſte.
Wherfore that we mowe be ſo knytte to hym by grace /
be we aboute with all oure wille and myȝte to folwe hym /
that is to ſay in trewe ſolitarie beynge / as it is ſeide / and in
deuoute prayere / in faſtynge and discrete bodily penaunce
doynge.  And furthermore in that that his conuerſacioun

ſymplely and bere vs lowely in what manere congregacioun
we ben· and there with to bere paciently and ſuffre alſo
hem that ſemen to vs as vnreſonable and beſtial in maneres

of leuynge of oure lorde Jeſu criſt in deſerte ſo in penaunce
tho xl dayes / euery criſten ſoule ouȝte ofte tyme viſite hym
there by deuoute compaſſioun / and ſpecially in that tyme
bygynnynge at the Epiphanie / whan he was baptiſed / in to<EPB/><PB N="94" ID="pb.97"/>
xl dayes after / in the whiche he faſted and lyued there /
as it is ſeide.</P><P>¶ But now furthermore as to his temptacioun.  Whan
tho xl dayes of his faſtynge were complete / oure lorde
Jeſu hungred· and anon that falſe temptour / the fende /
that was beſy aboute to knowe whether he were goddes
ſone / cam to hym / and gan to tempte hym of glotonye
and ſeide: Ȝif thou be goddes ſone / ſeie that theſe ſtones
be made and torned in to looues.  But he myȝte not with
his trecherie deceyue hym that was mayſter of truthe·
for he anſwered hym ſo wiſely / that neither he was
ouercome by the temptacioun of glotony and ȝit the
aduerſarie myȝte not knowe that he deſired· for neither
he denyed / ne affermed that he was goddes ſone / but
concluded hym by auctorite of holy writt.  And ſo haue
we here enſaumple of oure lorde Jeſu to withſtonde the
vice of glotonye: for there moſte we bygynne ȝif we wil
ouercome othere vices / as the enemy comounly bygynneth
therwith to aſſaile hem that taken hem to gooſtly lyuynge.
Wherfore as it ſemeth he that is ouercome with that vice
of glotonye / that while he is feble and vnmyȝti to ouercome
and withſtonde other vices· as doctours ſeien in this place
of the goſpell / that bot glotonye be firſt refreyned / man
trauailleth in veyn aȝenſt othere vices.</P><P>¶ Afterward the deuel toke hym vppe and bare hym
in to Jeruſalem / that was fro that place aboute viij myle
as men ſeien / and there he ſette hym vppon the pynacle
of the temple where he tempted hym of veyne ioye /
coueitynge to knowe as he didde bifore whether he were
goddes ſone.  But here was he alſo ouercome by auctorite
of holy writte· ſo that he loſte fully his purpos: in that
he hirte hym not as a man by pride / and hym ſelfe was
neuere the wiſere of his godhede.  And here haue we<EPB/><PB N="95" ID="pb.98"/>
enſaumple of pacience / conſiderynge the grete benignyte
and pacience of oure lord Jeſu / that ſuffred hym ſelf to
be handeled and borne of that cruel beeſt that hated hym
and al that he loued.</P><P>¶ And after that tyme / as ſeint Bernard ſeith / the
enemy ſeeng that he ſchewed no thing of the godhede /
and ſuppoſynge therby that he was not god / tempted
hym after as a man.  At this thridde tyme whan he toke
hym vp efte and bare hym aȝen in to a ful hiȝe hille / by
ſide the forſeide hille of Quarentena / as the ſpace of two
myle / and there he tempted hym of auarice and therwith
of ydolatrie.  But therfore was he there opounly reproued
and fully venquyſched and ouercome / as dyuerſe doctoures
tellen that expownen more pleynely thiſe temptaciouns and
this goſpelle· and therefore we paſſen ouer the ſhortlyere
here / as we done in othere expoſiciouns / ſtandinge principally
in meditaciouns / as it was ſeide at the bigynnynge
of this book.</P><P>¶ Ȝif we take then here good hede hou oure lord Jeſu
was handeled and tempted of the enemy / we ſchulle not
wondre thouȝ we wrecches be ofte ſithes tempted· for
not only he was tempted in thiſe thre tymes / but alſo / as
Bernard ſeithe / in other dyuerſe tymes / as the apoſtil
ſeith that he was tempted in all manere temptacioun that
longeth to the infirmyte of man / with oute ſynne.</P><P>¶ Furthermore whan the enemy was fully ouercome /
and gone awey / aungels come and ſerued and myniſtred
hym.  But here take we now good hede and byholde
ynwardly oure lord Jeſu etynge allone and the aungelles
aboute hym· and thynke we deuoutly be ymaginacioun
tho thinges that folowen here after / for thei ben ful faire
and ſtiringe to deuocioun.  And ſo firſte we mowe aſke
what manere of mete it was that the aungeles ſerued hym<EPB/><PB N="96" ID="pb.99"/>
of after that longe faſte.  Here of ſpeketh not holy writt:
wherfore we mowe here ymagyne by reſoun and ordeyne
this worthy feſte as vs liketh / nouȝt by errour affermynge /
bot deuoutly ymagynynge and ſuppoſinge / and that after
the comoun kynde of the manhede· for ȝif we take hede
and ſpeke of his myȝt after the godhede there is no
queſtioun / for it is no dowte that he myȝte make what
that hym leſte / and alſo haue of thoo that bene or weren
made at his owne wille.  But we ſchulle not fynde that
he vſed this myȝt and this powere for hym ſelf / or for his
diſciples in her bodily nede / but for the peple to ſchewe
his godhede.  We reden that at tweie tymes he fedde
hem myraculouſliche / in grete multitude / of a fewe loues
and fiſches.  But of his diſciples is writen that in his
owne preſence they plucked eres of corne and eten hem
for honger / as it ſchal folwe here after.  Alſo what tyme
he hym ſelf was wery of the wey / and ſatte vppon the
welle / ſpekynge with a womman Samaritane / we reden
not that he made mete forto ete / but that he ſente his
diſciples in to the citee to bygge her mete· and ſo it is not
lickely at this tyme after his faſte and bodily honger he
purueiede his mete by myracle / ſithen in this tyme he
ſchewed only his manhede.  And alſo there was no peple
there forto worche myracle to her edificacioun as comounly
he didde / bot only aungels weren there preſent.  And ſithen
in that hille was none dwellynge of men / ne mete redy
diȝte / we ſchulle ſuppoſe that aungelles brouȝten hym
mannis mete al redy diȝt fro another place / as it byfel
to the prophete Daniel.  For as holy writt telleth what
tyme daniel was putte in to pitte of lyouns / and abakuc /
another prophete / bare mete to his reperes on the felde /
goddes aungel took hym vp by the here of his hede and
bare hym fro thens in to Babiloyne to Daniel forto be fedde<EPB/><PB N="97" ID="pb.100"/>
with that mete / and after anone he was borne aȝeyne.
And ſo in that manere leten vs ymagyne here and with
goſtly merthe / as it were / rehetynge oure lord Jeſu at
this mete· and alſo hauynge in mynde ſpecially his dere
moder / thynke we deuoutely in this manere.  What tyme
Sathanas was reproued as a falſe temptour and ouȝterly
dryuen away / holy aungeles in grete multitude commen
to oure lorde Jeſu after his victorie / and fallynge doun
to the erthe deuoutely honoured him and ſalued hym as
her lorde and almyȝty god· and oure lorde benignely
and ſwetely toke hem vp and enclynynge to hem with
his hede / as it were knowelechynge him ſelf verray man /
and in that ſomewhat laſſe and lowed fro aungelles.  And
then ſpeken the angeles and ſeiden thus: Oure worthy
lorde / ȝe haue longe faſted and it is nowe tyme to ete·
what is ȝour wille that we ordeyne for ȝow?  And than
he ſeide: Gooth to my dere moder / and what manere
of mete ſche hath redy bringe it to me· for there is no
bodily mete ſo likynge to me as that is of hir diȝtinge.  And
anone tweyne of hem goynge forthe ſodeynely weren bifore
hir / and with grete reuerence gretynge and ſaluynge hir
on hir ſones byhalue / tolden hir meſſage.  And ſo of
that ſymple mete that ſche hadde ordeyned to hir ſelfe
and Joſeph the aungels token with a lof and a towaile
and othere neceſſaries and brouȝten to Jeſu / and perauenture
therewith a fewe ſmale fiſches that oure ladye hadde
ordeyned then / as god wolde· and ſo therwith the
aungels comynge ſpradden the towayle vppon the grounde
and leiden brede theron / and myldely ſtoden and ſeiden
graces with oure lord Jeſu / abidynge his bliſſynge and
til he was ſette.</P><P>¶ Now take good entente here / ſpecially thou that art

allone / as with oute mannis felawſchippe / the manere of
this mete and how lowely oure lord Jeſu ſitteth downe
to his mete on the bare grounde / for there had he neither
banker ne kuſchyne.  And take hede how curteyſely and
how ſoburly he taketh his mete· not withſtondynge his
hunger after his longe faſte.  The aungeles ſerued hym
as her lorde / perauntre one of brede / another of wyne /
another diȝte fiſches / ſome ſongen in the ſtede of mynſtralcie
that ſwete ſong of heuene· and ſo they reheteden
and conforted her lorde / as it longed to hem / with myche

hadde eten and ſeide graces / that is to ſeie thonkynge
the fader in his manhede of that bodily refeccioun / he
badde the aungelles bere aȝen to his moder that was laft /<EPB/><PB N="99" ID="pb.102"/>
tellynge hir that he ſchulde in ſchort tyme come to hir

aȝeyn to my fader and to ȝoure bliſſe / and recommendeth
me to hym and to alle the court of heuene· for ȝit it
byhoueth me to doo my pilgrymage awhile here in erthe.
And anon therewith they fallynge doun to the erthe and

we at this tyme ſchullen ſuppoſe / after the comoun

ordeyne therfore certeyne dayes bifore· ſo that whan
othere geſtes were beden / ſche was there all redy and
homely bifore.  The ſecounde euydence is that ſche knewe

The thridde euydence hereof is that ſche badde the ſeruauntes

goſtly matrymoyne is moche more worthy and perfyte.
Alſo in that harde anſwere and ſtraunge / as to ſemynge /
that he ȝaf to his moder whan he ſeide: What is that to
me and to the / womman?  As ſeynt Bernard ſeith / he
tauȝte vs that ben religious and haue forſake the worlde

it and forſake oure ſelf / myche more we be free and

the monke anſwered and ſeide that ſo was he dede to the

hem and enforme hem the perfeccioun of the
newe lawe / he ladde hem vp in an hille / that
is cleped Thabor / aboute two myle fro Naȝareth after
the comoun opinioun· and there he made to hem a longe
ſermoun and full of fruyte / the whiche as ſeynt Auſtyn
ſeith in the byginnynge of his book that he made of that
ſame ſermoun: It conteneth all the perfeccioun of criſten
lyuynge· for in that ſermoun he tauȝte hem firſte whiche
men ben bleſſed of god and worthy to haue his bliſſe.
Alſo he tauȝte hem the trewe manere of prayere / of
faſtynge / and of almeſdede / and othere vertues longynge
to the perfite lyf of man: as the texte of that goſpelle
opounly telleth / and dyuers doctoures and clerkes expownen
it ſufficiently· the whiche proceſſe we paſſen
ouer here / for as moche as it is writen bothe in latyn
and in engliſche in many othere places· and alſo it were
ful longe proceſſe to touche alle the poyntes thereof here
as by manere of meditacioun.  Wherfore at this tyme we
ſchulle ſpecially note that oure lorde bygan this ſermone
firſte at pouerte / doynge vs to vndirſtonde that pouerte
is the firſte grounde of all gooſtly exerciſe· for he that is
ouerleide and charged with temporel goodes and worldely
richeſſes may not frely and ſwiftly folowe criſt / that is<EPB/><PB N="110" ID="pb.113"/>
the myrour and enſaumple of pouerte· namely he that
hath his likynge and his affeccioun vndir thiſe worldely
goodes / for he is not fre / but thralle and as in bondage
of hem.  For of that thing that a man loueth inwardely
and by affeccioun he is made wilfully thralle and ſeruaunt·
and therfore is the pore man bleſſed: that is to
ſay / he that ynwardely loueth no thing but god or for
god / and therfore he deſpiſeth alle othere worldely thinge
for god / for in that is he knytte to god as for the more
parte.  Wherfore ſeith ſeynt Bernarde in a ſermone / that
pouerte is a grete fethere / or a grete wynge / thoruȝ the
whiche a man fleeth ſo ſone into the kyngdome of heuene.
For as to othere vertues that folowen in this place of the
goſpelle / the mede of hem is byhiȝt forto come as in tyme
that foloweth after.  Bot to the vertue of pouerte / it is
nouȝt only byhiȝte forto come / but as in tyme that is
now preſent it is ȝeuen of criſt by the forſeide wordes at
the bygynnynge of his ſermone / that ben theſe: Bleſſed
ben they that ben pore in ſpiryte· for her mede is the
kyngdom of heuen.  Loo / he ſeith not: Here mede ſchal
be / bot as now: Here mede is.  Alſo thei that ben not only
pore / but pore in ſpirite ben bleſſid· for thereynne ſtant
the vertue of pouerte.  And he is pore in ſpirite that hath
litel of the ſpirite of pride / that is comoun to mankynde by
the firſte ſynne / as a man is cleped pore worldely that hath
litel of worldely goodes.</P><P>¶ But now leuynge this matere torne we vs to the

his bliſſed face / and heren the ſwete wordes / and ſetten
hem beſily in her mynde: and ſo haue they grete ioye
and goſtely likynge / bothe in his ſpeche and in his ſiȝte·
and ſpecially / as I hope / they were conforted in that
noble ſchort prayere that he tauȝte hem amonge othere
in that tyme / that is the <FOREIGN>Pater noſter</FOREIGN> / and that for the
grete fruyte that thei feleden therynne / and alſo for
the grete triſte and hope that they were putte ynne
therby.  For as we mowe wele ſuppoſe as to the firſte /
that is the fruyte therof / not only they vnderſtode it aftir
the lettre / but alſo therwith they hadden thoruȝ his grace
the gooſtly vndirſtondynge eche parte and peticioun
thereof· and ſithen therynne is conteyned the aſkynge
of alle that vs nedeth to the body and to the ſoule / and
that touchinge oure temporel lyf in this worlde and the
lyf euerelaſtynge in another world / and alle comprehended
in ſo ſchorte wordes / no wonder thouȝ they hadde grete
likynge and comforte in that prayer by the grete fruyte
that thei taſteden therynne.  And ſo hauen alle thei that
thoruȝ grace felen the gooſtly fruyte and the ſwete taſte
therof.  Alſo as to the ſecounde comforte in that prayere /
that is triſte and hope: how myȝt her triſt and hope be
more ſtabled and ſtrengthed than to ſe hym that all
onely knewe what was nedefulle and ſpedefulle to hem
to aſke / and that myȝt only ȝeue it hem? teche hem
that peticioun by the whiche they myȝte not erre in her
aſkynge / ne faille of her aſkynge?  And ſo he that was
domeſman made the libelle in her cauſe / aȝenſt the whiche
he myȝte not ȝeue his dome and his ſentence.  Alſo he
that was lorde made the bille to his ſeruauntes / forto aſke
onely thoo thinges that were nedeful to hem / and likynge
to hem forto graunte: more comforte myȝte not be touchynge
prayere and aſkynge in nede.  And alſo more ouere<EPB/><PB N="112" ID="pb.115"/>
this comforte of this prayere was the more / for alſo moche
as next byfore in the ſame place of ſermone he reproued
the prayere of ypocrites and othere that weren not worthy
to be herde· and ſo was the medecyne more comfortable
and likynge / that the defaute and the ſekeneſſe was
oponed and tolde bifore.  All this comforte ſchulle we
fynde in this forſeide prayere <FOREIGN>Pater noſter</FOREIGN> / ȝif we ſeie it
deuoutly and not in dedly ſynne· for oure lord Jeſu
made not only this prayer to his diſciples that were
that tyme ſpecially with hym in that hille / but alſo to
vs and alle criſten men generally that ſchulde make here
prayere to the fader of heuene in his name vnto the
worldes ende.  But the more harme is / here is myche
peple diſceyued that leueth to moche this moſte worthy
prayere and beſte by ſynguler deuocioun in othere priuate
prayeres / or ſeienge it with oute deuocioun· as we mowe
ſee alday many men and wommen berynge bedes with
trillynge on the fyngres and waggynge the lippes / bot
the ſiȝt caſte to vanytees and the herte that only god
knoweth / as it is to drede / ſette more vppon worldely
thinges.  Of the whiche manere of peple ſpeketh oure
lord god by the prophete / and ſeith thus: This peple
prayeth and honoureth me with hir lippes / bot her herte
is fer fro me.  But for alſo moche as this mater is ſpoken
of in many othere tretys and bookes bothe in latyne and in
Engliſche / and this prayer ſufficiently expowned / therfore
we paſſen ouer more ſchortly at this tyme hereof.
But one thing touchinge this prayer: ſothely I trowe that
whoſo wil ȝeue his entent forto ſeie it with deuocioun /
and hath an ynward deſire to the goſtly vnderſtondynge
therof / ſettynge his herte therto alſo myche as he may
whan he ſeith it bothe yn comune and in priuete / he ſchall
thoruȝ grace by proceſſe of tyme fynde ſo moche comforte<EPB/><PB N="113" ID="pb.116"/>
therynne that there is non other prayer made of man
that ſchall be to hym ſo ſauery and ſo effectuele in what
ſo euere he nede / or caſe he be ſtirede ſpecially to praye
for remedie and help to god· and ſo ſchal he fynde in
his ſoule whan god wil ȝeue his grace with grete likynge
dyuerſe vnderſtondynge thereof moſte pertenent to his
deſire / and that othere than is writen in the comoun
expoſicioun thereof / or perauenture than he can telle.
But myche folk / as ſeruauntes and hirde men / haue
more wille to praye for ſpecial mede that they coueiten
here / than as trewe ſones for the loue and the pleſynge
of oure fader / god of heuene· and ſo they ſetten more
here likynges and beſyneſſe in a priuate prayer / made of
man / to oure lady or to othere ſeyntes of heuene / than
thei done in this general prayer / made of god hym ſelf·
the whiche with outen dowte is moſte pleſynge to hym
and moſt ſpedful to vs· and therefore thei ben diſceyued
in many maneres.  I ſpeke not here of the pſauter and
the ſeruiſe in holy chirche.  Neuertheles alſo othere

to othere ſeyntes of heuene bene gode to ben ſeide after
that the deuocioun of men is ſtired to ſeie hem in couenable
tyme / ſo that they ſette not her affeccioun the laſſe vppon

that with outen doute ſchal gete vs moſte effectuely of

with deuocioun· and ſpecially by that peticioun and
aſkynge: <FOREIGN>Fiat voluntas tua ſicut in celo et in terr</FOREIGN>a / that is
to ſaie: Oure fader in heuen / thy wille be done in all
thing / as in heuene ſo in erthe.  And ſo ȝif it be beſte to
vs forto be kept fro fire / or water / or ſodayne deth / or any
other bodily perile / with outen doute oure fader of heuene /
god / wille ȝeuen it vs after the forſeide peticioun with
riȝtwys lyuynge / and elles not / ſaye we neuere ſo manye
ſuche priuate prayeres.  For as we rede al day of dyuerſe
martires and ſeyntes / that ſome weren brent / ſome
drowned and in other dyuerſe maneres putte to ſchameful
deth as to the worlde· and that was beſte to hem and
encreſe of here ioye in the bliſſe of heuene: wherfore
it hadde be a grete open folie to hem / as we wele mowe
wete / to haue prayed forto be kepte fro ſuche bodily
harmes or periles.  And as anemptes ſodeyn deth / it is
ſpedefulle to many men forto haue ſuche deth ſchameful
to mannis ſiȝte / as ſeynt gregory telleth by enſaumple of
the prophete Abdo / that was weryede of the lyoun / that
god purgeth often tyme here riȝtwys men by ſuche ſchameful
deth· for as holy writte witneſſith ſothely:  The
riȝtwiſ man ȝif he be ouercome by eny manere of bodily
deth / his ſoule ſchal be ſaued / and he ſette in reſte euere
laſtynge.  Amen.  Neuertheles we praien ofte and that
leefully to be kepte fro ſodeyn dethe: bot that is vnderſtonden
that we be not combred with dedly ſynne / thereynne

effectuele prayere the <FOREIGN>Pater noſter</FOREIGN> / ſpecially in the tweyne

prayen all myȝty god / fader of heuene / that he ſuffre vs
not to falle and to be combred with temptacioun of
dedely ſynne / but that he kepe vs and delyuere vs fro
all wickedneſſe.  Amen.</P><P>¶ And though it ſo be that the mater of this worthy
prayere be ſo plentevous / and alſo the deſire of the
writer hereof were to ſpeke more thereof / neuertheles
for it is writen in ſo many othere places as I hope
ſufficiently / and alſo for the grete proceſſe that foloweth
after / we leuen this mater at this tyme / and all that
fructuouſe ſermoun that oure lord Jeſu made to his diſciples
in that hille biforeſeide.  Goynge downe with him
by deuoute contemplacioun and byholdynge how that
after that noble leſſoun tauȝt in the hiȝe hille / as it was
ſkilfull for the hiȝe perfeccioun thereof / oure lorde Jeſu
came downe with that meke flokke of the diſciples / ſpekynge
alſo homely with hem by the wey· and they / as the
briddes or chykenes of the henne / folowen hym with moche
gooſtly lykynge / coueitynge eche byfore other to be next

What tyme he ſent his diſciples in to the citee forto bigge

bot only the clene water of the welle or the ryuere / etynge

Alſo in that he anſwered to his diſciples firſte whan thei

paſſed in perfeccioun the hiȝeſt degre of wilful pouerte
of othere withoute compariſoun· for othere mennis
pouerte that haue forſaken for criſtes loue alle richeſſes

in alſo myche as it is holden vertuouſe / as it is· bot his
pouerte was in reprofe and deſpite of men in alſo myche
as it was not knowen that he toke this pouerte priuely /
bot as of nede· as it ſemed in the forſeide proceſſe of hym

and he halp hem not / and in many othere places of the

myche as that pouerte that cometh of nede and not of wille

that he hadde neither houſe ne poſſeſſiouns / they had hym
in the more contempte· for comounly ſuche nedful pore
men ben deſpiſed of alle men and ſette at nouȝt / bot neuertheles
they mowe be ful honourable in his ſiȝt / that thus
ȝaf enſaumple therof:  wherefore it is full perilous forto

to ſeie the firſte of actif / the ſecounde of contemplatyf /
and the thridde / that is the ſecounde of actyf: the whiche
we paſſe ouer with grete proceſſe of contemplacioun and
manye auctoritees of ſeynte Bernarde.  For fewe there ben/
the more harme is / outher in ſtate of contemplatif lyf
touchinge the ſecounde poynte byfore ſeide / or in the
ſtate of perfiȝte actif lyffe touchynge the thridde poynt/
that comen to her aſtate by the trewe waye / that is declared
bifore.  And that is the cauſe that in this tyme manye there
ben / bothe men and wymmen / in the aſtate of contemplatyf
lyffe/ as eſpecially ancres and recluſes/ or heremytes/
that wyten litel as in effecte truly what contemplatyf lyffe
is by defaute of exerciſe in actif lyf / as it is bifore ſeide.
And therfore it is ful perilous and ful dredful to be in
eſtate of perfeccioun and haue a name of holyneſſe / as
hauen ſpecially thiſe recluſes / bot the lyuynge and the
gooſtly exerciſe of hem be accordynge therto.  For ſeint
gregorie ſeithe / that there be manye that fleen occupacioun
of the worlde and taken hem to reſte / bot there with thei
ben not occupied wyth vertues· and therfore ofte ſithes
it falleth that the more ſikerly that they ceſſe fro outwarde
occupacioun / the more largely thei gedre in to hem by
ydelneſſe the noyſe of vnclene thouȝtis.  And ſo of euerich
ſuche ſoule that ſpendeth her tyme in ydelneſſe and ſlouthe
ſpeketh the prophete Jeremye in his lamentaciouns in this
manere: <FOREIGN>Viderunt illam hoſtes et deriſerunt ſabbata eius</FOREIGN> /<EPB/><PB N="161" ID="pb.164"/>
that is to ſaye: The wicked ſpirites / enemyes of mankynde

that ſche is ferre fro outeward occupacioun and therby
is trowed to ſerue god in holyneſſe / in ſo myche ſche
ſerueth the tyraunterie of tho wicked ſpirites in ydelneſſe.
Alſo the ſame holy clerk gregorie in the ſame book / after
ſpekynge of theſe tweyne lyues / actyffe and contemplatyffe
/ ſeithe that mannis ſoule ſchulde firſt be wyped and
made clene of the deſire of temperel ioye and veyne glorie /
and of alle delectacioun or likynge of fleſchely luſt and
deſire· and then may he be lifte vppe to the ſiȝt and degre
of contemplacioun.  In figure and token herof whan god
ȝaf Moyſes the lawe the comune peple was forbeden to
neiȝhe the hille· in token that thei that ben of weyke wille

that is to ſeie that thei knowe hem ſelf beſily ȝif they done

the ſtorie of the tweyne douȝtres of Laban / the whiche
Jacob toke to his wifes / that weren i-cleped the eldre
Lya / that was ſore eiȝed but plenteuouſly berynge children /
by whom is tokened actiue· the ȝonger was Rachel / faire

ſchulde be byfore contemplatyf lyffe / as it is ſeide: and this
ſtorie is pleynely treted in many places to this purpoſe / and
therfore we paſſe ouer ſo ſchortly.</P><P>¶ But forto ſpeke of the manere of lyuynge in thiſe
tweyne lyues / actyfe and contemplatyfe / in ſpecialle / and
namely of actyfe lyfe that ſtant in ſo many degrees as of
ſeculeres and religioufe / and lered and lewed / it were

hauen habundaunce of temperel goodes in euery degre
is writen ſufficiently / as I hope· and therfore I leue
to ſpeke more of this mater at this tyme / ſaue to make an
ende accordynge to the bygynnynge of the mater byforeſeide
in the goſpelle of thiſe tweyne ſiſtres / Martha and
Marye· by the whiche ben vndirſtonden theſe tweyne
lyffes / actyf and contemplatif / as it is ſeide.  Firſt / they

vertue that is ſouereynly nedefulle to hem in alle her

be with oute dedly ſynne· for elles Jeſu wolde not dwelle
in her hous nor accepte her ſeruice.  Alſo as to othere /
that they deme not ne deſpiſe othere / the whiche perauenture
done not ſo manye vertuouſe dedes as to mannis
ſiȝte as thei done· for they mowe not knowe the priue
domes of oure lorde Jeſu that accepted more pleſyngly
and preferred the priue contemplacioun of Marie / that
ſatte at his fete in ſilence / as ſche hadde I-be ydel / byfore
alle the grete beſy ſeruice of Martha· and that was for the
feruent loue that ſche hadde in contemplacioun of hym: and
ȝit was the ſeruice and the beſyneſſe of Martha full pleſynge
to Jeſu and medeful to hir / as actyf is good but contemplatyf
is better.</P><P>¶ And ſo furthermore it is to note that / notwithſtondynge
the grete commendacioun of oure lorde Jeſu touchynge
Marye and the preferrynge of hir parte / Martha grucched
not of hir parte / but contynued forthe in her manere of

dyuerſe places what longeth to mekeneſſe· ſothely elles
alle his byldynge of contemplacioun be it neuere ſo hiȝe

herto is pacience in ſuffrynge falſe demynges / ſcornes /
and reproues of the worlde that he ſchal ſuffre that fully
forſaketh and deſpiſeth the worlde as it nedeth to the trewe

his cauſe to his aduoket Jeſu / withouten anſwere reprouynge
aȝeyne / as Marye didde whan the phariſee
demed and reproued hir.  Alſo hir ſiſtre playned vppon
hir / and the diſciples hadde indignacioun and grucched
aȝenſt hir· but in alle thiſe ſche kepte ſcilence / that is the
thridde vertue nedefull to the contemplatyfe.  And ſo
ferthere forth ſche ȝaf enſaumple of ſilence / that we fynde

thouȝ the dede folowe not after / he is acounted as a

manere of gooſtly dethe is vndirſtande by that firſte dede
body that oure lorde Jeſu reyſed in the hous / that was
the douȝter of the prince of the ſynagoge / or the mayſtre

telleth that he came to oure lorde Jeſu / prayenge hym
that he wolde come to his hous and hele his douȝter that

grace and endeles goodneſſe was euere redy to helpe and
hele alle thoo that aſked hym trewely / was goynge with
hym towarde his houſe there came worde to the forſeide
prince that his douȝter was dede / and therfore they beden
hym that he ſchulde not make the maiſter / that is Jeſu /
trauaille in vayne· for they trowed wele that he was of
myȝt to hele the ſeeke / bot not to reyſe the dede.  And
neuertheles oure lorde Jeſu letted not for her myſbileue

For as ſeynt Auſtyne ſeithe / it falleth all day that a man

And this is the firſte manere of dedly ſynne and liȝteſt forto

neuertheles this manere of dedly ſynne that is onely in

it be gooſtly / as hiȝe pryde or envye: for as ſeynt gregor

hou vppon a tyme whan oure lorde Jeſu walked in the

Salamonis porche / in the feſte of the dedicacioun of the

that ȝif he hadde openliche knowlecched that he was criſt /
that is to ſaye anoynte kyng / than forto han taken hym
and accuſed hym as traytour to Ceſar / the Emperour of

ſoburly and mekely ſeide to hem aȝeyne: I ſpeke to ȝow
and ȝe leue me not· bot the werkes that I doo in the
name of the fader / tho beren witneſſe of me what I am.
And after more ouer whan he ſeide: I and my fader
aren all one· they token vppe ſtones forto haue ſtoned
hym as blaſfeme / makynge hym ſelf god.  And ferthermore<EPB/><PB N="171" ID="pb.174"/>
whan oure lorde hadde concluded hem in that partie
by reſoun and auctorite of holy writte / that they myȝt not

went with his diſciples byȝonde Jordane in to that place
where John Baptiſte firſt baptiſed / aboute xviij mile fro

now to oure purpos / laȝar / the brother of Martha and

This infirmyte is not to deth· but for the louynge of

telleth that he ſeide theſe wordes to hem / bot it ſpecifieth
not to whome· for the ſiſtres that ſenden to hym were
not that tyme preſent / but a grete wey fro hym / as it
is ſeide.  Neuertheleſs we mowe vndirſtonde / as by the

as it is moſte likkely.
</P><EPB/><PB N="172" ID="pb.175"/><P>¶ A lorde / what comforte was this to the ſiſtres whan
they herden of the meſſager thiſe wordes that Jeſu ſeide:

that they wolde haue hadde hym preſerued fro the dethe

falleth ofte ſithes with hem that god loueth and bene in

that comforte that thei aſken and deſiren / but ſuffreth
hem as for the tyme to be in deſpeyre of her deſire· and

oure lorde Jeſu was certified of the ſeke laȝar / and had

Go we aȝen in to Jury.  And they aferde of this worde

And wole ȝe not ȝeue counſeile to me / ſithen it is nede to

Mary ſatte ſtille at home til after that ſche was cleped

theſe tweyne ſiſtres / Martha and Maria / dyuerſly hadden

gooſtly here / as he doth in othere places / the dyuerſe

it is no dowte but that Marie loued Jeſu als mykel as her

badde hem alway doo her dewete after the lawe / and commended

And ſo he was occupied fro the morwe in to the euentyde

abydinge til it was made redy for hem in the forſeide hous
alofte.  And whanne alle thinges weren redy / ſeint John /
that was moſte homely and famylier with oure lorde Jeſu /
and that beſily went too and fro to ſee that all that neded
were ordeyned and done / came to hym and ſeide: Sire /
ȝe mowe goo to ſopere whan ȝe wole· for alle thinges ben
redy.  And than anon oure lorde Jeſu with the xij apoſtles
went vppe· bot John allgate next hym and by his ſide
with oute departynge· for there was none that ſo truely
and famyliarly drowȝ to hym and folowed hym as he
didde· for whan he was take he folowed hym whan
othere fledde / and was preſente at his crucifienge and at
his deth· and after he lafte him nouȝt til al was done and
he was buried: and ſo at this ſopere he ſatte next hym /
thouȝ he was ȝonger than othere.  What tyme thanne
oure lorde Jeſu with the xij apoſtles came vppe to the
borde where vppon thei ſchulde ete· firſt ſtondynge there
aboute they deuoutely ſeiden graces / and after he hadde
bliſſed they ſeten downe alle aboute that borde / but John
next Jeſu / and that vppon the grounde / as the manere was
of olde men byfore.</P><P>¶ But here we ſchulle vnderſtonde alſo that that borde
was ſquare / as men ſuppoſen / made of dyuerſe bordes
ioyned to gidre· and / as men ſeien that han ſeen it at
Rome in the chirche of lateranenſis / it conteyneth in<EPB/><PB N="199" ID="pb.202"/>
euery parte of the foure ſquare the ſpace of tweye armes
lengthe and ſomwhat more· ſo that in euery ſide of the
ſquare borde thre diſciples ſeten / as men ſuppoſen / thouȝ
it were ſtreiȝtely / and oure lorde Jeſu in ſome angule· ſo
that they alle myȝte reche in to the myddes and ete of one
diſſhe: and therfore they vnderſtode hym not what tyme
he ſeide:  He that with me putteth his honde in to the
diſche or dobeler / he ſchal betraye mee.  Thus we mowe
ymagyne and ſuppoſe of the manere of her ſittynge at the
borde.</P><P>¶ Alſo we mowe vndirſtonde in the etynge of the paſke
lombe that in that tyme they ſtoden aboute the borde vppe
riȝt / haldynge ſtaffes in her hondes / after the biddynge of
moyſes lawe / that oure lorde come to fulfille: ſo that thouȝ
they ſtoden in that tyme / neuertheles they ſeten alſo in
other tyme / as the goſpell telleth in dyuers places· and
elles myȝte nouȝt John haue leide his heued and reſted
hym in manere of ligginge vppon the breſt of Jeſu.</P><P>¶ What tyme the paſke lombe was brouȝt to the borde /
roſted after the lawe / oure lorde Jeſu / that was ſothefaſte
lombe of god with outen weme of ſynne / and that was in
myddes of hem / as he that ſerueth and mynyſtreth / toke
the lombe in his bliſſed hondes and kutte it and departed
it and ȝaf to the diſciples / biddynge hem eten gladly and
confortynge hem with louely chere.  Bot thouȝ it ſo was
that they eten as he badde· neuertheles comforte they
myȝte none haue / for alſo moche as they dredde all wey
leſt there ſchulde falle ouȝt aȝenſt her lorde in that nouelte.
And ſo as they eten he tolde hem the ſorwful dede more
opounly and ſeide: I haue deſired forto ete with ȝow this
paſk lambe byfore I ſuffre the deth / for ſothely on of ȝow
ſhal betray me.  This ſpeche went to her hertes as an
ſcharpe ſwerde.  Wherfore they ceſſeden of etynge and<EPB/><PB N="200" ID="pb.203"/>
lokeden eche on othere / and ſeiden to hym: Lorde /
whether I be he?</P><P>¶ Here ȝif we take good hede we oweth to haue
ynward compaſſioun / bothe of oure lorde Jeſu / and alſo of
hem· for it is no dowte they were in ful greet ſorwe.  But
the traytour Judas lafte not of etynge / for thiſe wordes of
betrayenge ſchulde not ſeme as perteynynge to hym.</P><P>¶ Than John at the inſtaunce of Petir aſked of oure
lorde and ſeide: Lorde / who is he that ſchal betraye the?
And oure lorde Jeſu priuely tolde hym / and / as to hym
that he loued more ſpecially / ſpecified who was that traytour.
And John thereof gretly aſtonyed / and wounded
with grete ſorwe to the herte / nouȝt wolde telle Petir /
but turned him to Jeſu and ſoftely leide doun his heued
vppon his bliſſed breeſt.  And / as ſeynt Auſtyn ſeith / oure
lorde wolde not telle Petir who was the traytoure· for
and he hadde wiſte / he wolde haue al to toren hym with
his teeth.</P><P>¶ And as the ſame ſeint Auſtyn ſeith / by petre ben
figured and vndirſtande thei that ben in actyfe lyffe· and
by John they that ben in contemplatyf.  Wherfore we
haue here doctrine and figure that he that is contemplatyf
meddeleth hym not with foreyn worldely dedes· and alſo
he ſecheth not vengeaunce with outeforthe of the offences
done to god / but is ſory with ynneforth in his herte· and
torneth hym onely to god by deuoute prayeres / and the
more ſaddely tornynge hym and drawynge hym to god
committeth alle thing to his diſpoſicioun and ordynaunce.
Thouȝ it ſo be that he that is contemplatyf ſomme tyme
goth oute by ȝele of god and profite of mannis ſoule / as
whan he is cleped therto.  Alſo in that that John wolde
not telle peter that he badde hym aſke of the traytour / we
mowe vnderſtonde that the contemplatyf ſchal not reuele<EPB/><PB N="201" ID="pb.204"/>
the priuete of his lorde· as it is writen of ſeynt Fraunceys:
that priue reuelacions he reueled not with oute forthe /
bot what tyme that nede made hym fore hele of mannis
ſoule / or the ſterynge of god by reuelacioun meued him
therto.</P><P>¶ Now forthe in oure proceſſe / byholde we the grete
benignyte of oure lorde Jeſu that ſo homely ſuffereth his
derlynge John enclyne and reſte vppon his bliſſed breeſt.
Lorde / hou tenderly and trewely they loueden to gidre!
This was a ſwete reſte to John / and a profitable to alle
criſten ſoules· in the whiche / as clerkes ſeyn / he drank
of that welle of euerelaſtynge wiſdome the preciouſe drynk
of his holy goſpell / with the whiche after he conforted
all holy chirche and ȝaf it as triacle aȝenſt the venyme of
dyuerſe heretikes.  Byholde we ferthermore othere diſciples
ful ſory of the forſeide worde of betrayenge of oure
lorde Jeſu / not etynge bot lokynge echone on othere / as
they that wiſte not what counſeile or comforte they myȝte
haue in this caas.  And thus moche at this tyme ſuffiſeth
touchynge the firſte article of that bodily ſoper / and of the
etynge of the Paſke lombe in fulfillynge of the lawe and
endynge of the figure that oure lorde Jeſu didde it fore.
And as clerkes ſeien / we fynde not that oure lorde ete
fleſche in all his lyf / bot onely at this tyme in etynge of
that lambe / more for myſterie than for bodily fode.</P><P>¶ Touchynge the ſecounde poynt / that is the waſchynge
of the diſciples feet.  We ſchulle vnderſtande that
after the forſeide proceſſe oure lorde Jeſu roſe vppe fro the
forſeide ſopere / and alſo his diſciples anon with hym / vnwetynge
what he wolde doo ferthermore / or whider he
wolde goo· and than went he with hem downe in to the
neither hous / vnder the forſeide lofte / as they ſeien that
han ſeen that place.  And there he badde alle the diſciples<EPB/><PB N="202" ID="pb.205"/>
ſitte adowne / and made water be brouȝt to hym· and
than he caſte of his ouerclothes / that weren peraunter
cumbroſe and lettynge to that he thouȝte doo / and girde
hym with a lynnen clothe / and putte hym ſelf water in to
the baſyne that was of ſtone / as men ſayen / and bare it
and ſette it byfore Petres feete / and kneled doun forto
waſche hem.  But Petir gretly abaſched and aſtonyed
of that dede / as no wonder was / firſte forſoke to haue
that ſeruiſe of his lorde as inconuenient to hym· but after
he herde his threte that elles he ſchulde haue no parte
with hym in bliſſe / turned his wille into better and mekely
ſuffred hym to done his wille.</P><P>¶ Now ȝif we ȝeue here good entent to the dedes of
oure lorde Jeſu and all that foloweth in this tyme / ſothely
we mowe with grete wonder be ſtired ſpecially bothe to
the loue and drede of hym.  For what was that to ſee the
kynge of bliſſe and that hiȝe lorde of maieſtie knele doun
and bowe hym to the feete of a pore fiſſhere / and ſo forthe
to alle othere that there ſeten aboute· and ſo with thoo
bliſſed handes waſche her foule feete and after tendirly
wipe hem / and more ouer deuoutly kiſſe hem.  Sothely he
that was ſouereyne mayſter of mekeneſſe ſchewed vs in
this dede and tauȝt vs a perfiȝt leſſoun thereof· and ȝit
more ouer in that he didde the ſame lowe ſeruice to his
treytour commendeth ſouereynly his paſſynge mekeneſſe.
But wo to that harde herte / ȝe harder than the adamaunde
or eny othir thing hardeſte· that melteth not or ſofteth
not with the hete of ſo grete fire of charite and profounde
mekeneſſe / and that dredeth not that lorde of maieſte in
that dede· but aȝeynewarde frowardely thenketh and procureth
dethe and deſtruccioun of hym that euere was ſo
innocent and ſo trewe louynge.  Wherfore it is bothe
wonderfull and dredfull the grete benygnyte and mekeneſſe<EPB/><PB N="203" ID="pb.206"/>
of oure lorde Jeſu / and the grete obſtynaſie and
malice of that traytour Judas aȝeynwarde.</P><P>¶ Whan this waſchynge was done in myſterie / as it is
ſeide / he went aȝen vppe to the place of the forſeide
ſopere· and whan he was ſette with hem / he tolde hem the
cauſe of the forſeide dede· and that was that they ſchulde
folowe hym in mekeneſſe eche to other / as he ȝaf hem
enſaumple that was her lorde and maiſtre· and that they
ſchulde not onely waſſhe othere feete / but alſo forȝeue
treſpaſes done to othere· and wille and doo good to
othere / as it is vndirſtande by his wordes that folowen
after whan he ſeide to hem: Ȝif ȝe knowe thiſe that I haue
done to ȝow / ȝe ſchulle be bliſſed ȝif ȝe fulfille hem in
dede.  Here alſo aftir the firſte meſſe that was the paſke
lombe / as it is ſeide bifore / whan they were waſſhen and
made clene / he ſerued hem withe the ſecounde meſſe
of his owne precious body / that was deynte of alle deyntees:
as men vſen in bodily fedynge and feſtes / firſt to be
ſerued with boyſtous and homely metes / and after with
more delicate and deyntees.  Where of foloweth here after
touchynge the thridde article.</P><P>¶ As anemptes the thridde article of that hiȝeſt ſacrament
of Jeſu preciouſe body / lyfte we here vppe oure

this manere.  Whan he hadde waſche his diſciples fete
and was gone vppe aȝeyn with hem there he byfore ſatte
at the ſopere / as it is ſeide / as for an ende of the ſacrifices
of the olde lawe and bygynnynge of the newe teſtament /
makynge hym ſelf oure ſacrifice / he toke brede in his<EPB/><PB N="204" ID="pb.207"/>
holy handes and lifte vp his eiȝen to his fader / al myȝty god /
and bleſſed the brede and ſeide the wordes of conſecracioun
there ouere· by vertue of the whiche wordes brede
was turned into his body· and than he ȝaf it to his diſciples
/ and ſeide: Taketh and eteth / for ſothe this is my
body that ſchal be taken and ȝeuen for ȝowe.  And after
in the ſame manere takynge the chalys with wyne / ſeide:
Taketh and drinketh alle here of / for this is my blood
that ſchal be outſchedde for ȝow and manye in remiſſioun
of ſynnes.  And after he ȝaf hem power of that conſecracioun
and alle preoſtes in hem / and ſeide: This doth ȝe as
ofte as ȝe take it in mynde and commemoracioun of me.</P><P>¶ Take now good hede here thou criſten man / but
ſpecially thou preoſt / how deuoutly / how dyligently
and trewely thy lorde Jeſu criſte firſte made this preciouſe
ſacrament· and after with his bliſſed handes mynyſtred
it and communed that bliſſed and his byloued meigne.
And on the tother ſide take hede with what deuoute
wondre firſte they ſeie hym make that wonderfulle and
excellent ſacrament· and after with what drede and
reuerence they toke it and reſceyued it of hym.  Sothely
at this tyme they lefte al theire kyndely reſoun of man /
and onely reſtede in trewe byleue to alle that he ſeide
and didde / byleuynge with oute eny dowte that he was
god and myȝt not erre.  And ſo moſte thou doo that wolt
fele and haue the vertue and the goſtly ſwetneſſe of this

memoriale that ſouereynly makith mannis ſoule worthy
and pleſyng to god alſo ofte as it is dewely reſceyued /
other by trewe deuoute meditacioun of his paſſioun / or
elles / and that more ſpecially / in ſacramentale etynge
there of.  Wherfore by reſoun this excellent ȝifte of loue
ſchulde kyndele mannis ſoule and enflawme it all holy<EPB/><PB N="205" ID="pb.208"/>
in to the ȝeuer therof / oure lorde Jeſu criſt· for there
is no thing that he myȝt ȝeue and leue to vs more derworthe
/ more ſwete / or more profitable than hym ſelf.
For with outen eny dowte he that we reſceyuen in the
ſacrament of the auȝter is he that ſelue goddes ſone Jeſu /
that took fleſche and blood and was borne of the virgyne
marye· and that ſuffred deth on the croſſe for vs / and
roos the thridde day to lyffe· and after ſteyhe vp into
heuene / and ſitteth on the fadres riȝt ſide· and that
ſchal come at the day of dome and deme all mankynde·
in whoſe power is bothe lyf and dethe· that made bothe
heuene and helle· and that onely may ſaue vs or dampne
vs euer with outen ende.  And ſo he that ſelf god and
man is conteyned in that litel ooſte that thou ſeeſt in
forme of brede· and euery day is offred vp to the
fader of heuene for oure goſtly hele and euer laſtynge
ſaluacioun.  This is the trewe byleue that holy chirche
hath tauȝt vs of this bliſſed ſacrament.</P><P>¶ But ȝit more ouer lete vs ſitte a litel lenger at this
worthy lordes borde / Jeſu· and take we hede ynwardely
to oure goſtly fode and comforte / more ſpecially of that
preciouſe and moſt deynteth mete that is there ſette byfore
vs / that is the bliſſed body of oure lorde Jeſu in
this holy ſacrament bifore ſeide.  And ſo by inward
conſideracioun taſte we the ſwetneſſe of this heuenly
foode / hauynge firſte in mynde the gracious and reſonable
makynge and ordynaunce of that bliſſed ſacrament· and
after the grete worthyneſſe and merveillous worchynge
there of in choſen ſoules to comforte and ſtrengthinge
of oure feithe.  As anemptes the firſte poynte / we ſchulle
vndirſtonde that all myȝty goddes ſone / the ſecounde

endeles godeneſſe to make vs pertyneres of his godhede<EPB/><PB N="206" ID="pb.209"/>
he toke oure kynde and by came man to make men as
goddes.  And ferthermore that he toke of oure kynde
that was fleſche and blode: al he ȝaf to vs for oure hele
and oure ſaluacioun· for he offred to his fader of heuene
vppon the auȝter of the croſſe his bliſſed body for oure
reconſilynge· and he ſchedde his precious blode in to
priſe forto bygge vs oute of oure wrecched thraldome /
and to waſſhe vs and make vs clene of all ſynne.  And
for alſo mykel as he wolde that the mynde of that hiȝe
grete benefice ſchulde dwelle in vs euerlaſtyngly / he ȝaf
to alle trewe criſten puple his body in to mete and his
blode in to drynke / vndir the likkeneſſe of brede and
wyne / in manere as it is ſeide bifore in the firſte makynge
of this bliſſed ſacrament.</P><P>¶ But now here byholde we inwardely and take we
gode hede what wonder thing it was to the apoſtles than
to ſee oure lord Jeſu / verray man as they were / ſittynge
with hem bodily· and there with holdynge in his hondes
that ſelf body in that that ſemed to hir bodily ſiȝt nouȝt
elles bot brede· affermynge thus ſothely: This is my
body that ſchal be ȝeuen for ȝow· and alſo of that that
in the Chalice ſemed onely verray wyne:  This is my
blood that ſchal be ſchedde for remiſſioun of ȝoure ſynnes.
And ſo that ſelfe body that they ſeiȝen with hir bodily
eyȝe byfore hem was ſothely vndir that fourme of brede·
and that ſelfe blode that was alle hole in his bodye was
there in that chalice in the forme of wyne.  But than
was not that brede as it ſemed / and as it was byfore the
wordes of conſecracioun· ne wyne as it ſemed in ſelue
manere: but only the liknes or the forme of brede and
wyne / conteynynge verrey criſtes fleſche and blode / as
it is ſeide.  But what mannis reſoun or witte myȝt comprehende
this at that tyme? Sothely / none.  And therfore<EPB/><PB N="207" ID="pb.210"/>
the trewe apoſtles at that tyme laften alle her bodily reſoun
and witte / and reſted only in trewe byleue to her lordes
wordes / as it is ſeide bifore / ſaue Judas that was reproued
for his falſhede and myſbyleue / and therfore he reſceyued
that bliſſed Sacrament in to his dampnacioun.  And
ſo done alle thoo that bene nowe of his parte· the
whiche falſely byleuen and ſeien that the holy Sacrament
of the auȝter is in his kynde brede or wyne / as
it was bifore the conſecracioun / bycauſe that it ſemeth
ſo to alle her bodily felynge / as in ſiȝte / taſte / and
touchynge.  The whiche ben more reprouable as in that
parte than Judas· for they ſeen not Jeſu bodily byſide
that ſacrament as he didde· and therfore it is liȝter to
hem forto byleue / and more to here dampnacioun ȝif
they byleued not / as god hym ſelf and holy chirche
hathe tauȝte: namely / ſithe that trewe techynges of this
bliſſed ſacrament hath be holden ſtedfaſtly ſo manye
hundred ȝere / and of ſo many holy men / martires and
confeſſoures / and othere trewe criſten men· the whiche
in to her laſte dayes ſtoden with outen doute in this feithe
and deiȝeden therynne.  The whiche feith is this in ſchorte
wordes: that the ſacrament of the auȝter duely made by
vertue of criſtes wordes is verrey goddes body in forme
of brede / and his verray blode in forme of wyne· and
thouȝ that forme of brede and wyne ſeme as to alle the
bodily wittes of man brede and wyne in his kynde as
it was bifore· neuertheles it is not ſo in ſotheneſſe / bot
onely goddes fleſche and blode in ſubſtaunce.  So that
the accidentes of brede and wyne wonderfully and myraculouſly
/ aȝenſt mannis reſoun and the comoun ordre
of kynde / ben there in that holy ſacrament with oute her
kyndely ſubiecte· and verray criſtes body that ſuffred

vndir the fourme and lickeneſſe of brede / and his verray
blode vndir likneſſe of wyne ſubſtanciallye and holly with
outen eny feynynge or diſceyte / and not onely in figure
as the falſe heretike ſeithe.</P><P>¶ Theſe termes I touche here ſo ſpecially by cauſe of
the lewed lollardes that medlen hem aȝenſt the feith
falſely.  And more ouer this feith of this excellent ſacrament
/ tauȝt by holy doctoures and worthy clerkes / is confermed
by many maneres of myracles / as we reden in

here lawheth the lollarde and ſkorneth holy chirche

ne feleth the gracious worchynge thereof in hym ſelf /
therfore he leueth noȝt that eny othir dothe.  But here in
confuſioun of alle falſe lollardes / and in comforte of alle
trewe loueres and worſchipperes of this holy ſacrament /
and principally to the louynge and honour of the hiȝe

oure lord Jeſu voucheth ſaufe to touche hym of his grace /

of the ſelf ſothefaſtneſſe.  For what tyme that oure lorde
Jeſu criſt appereth in that bliſſed ſacrament to ſtrengthinge
of byleue / or to comforte of his choſen derlynges / outher
in likneſſe of a litel childe / as we reden that he didde to

hede / thou criſten ſoule that haſt eny liȝt withyn the of the
fire of loue / how this ſouerayne ſcole mayſter / Jeſu criſte /
made to his diſciples a noble ſermoun fulle of goſtly ſwetneſſe
and brennynge coles of loue and charitee.  For whan
he hadde ȝeuen that bliſſed ſacrament to his diſciples and /
amonge othere / of his hiȝe charitee to his enemye / that
wicked Judas / he ſeide to hym: <FOREIGN>Quod facis</FOREIGN> / that thou
purpoſeſt to do / <FOREIGN>fac cicius</FOREIGN> / do it anone: als who ſeithe: I
wote where aboute thou ert / and therfore delyuere the by

none of his othere diſciples that wiſte to what ende that
Jeſu ſeide thoo wordes.  And anone this curſed treytour
wente forthe to the princes of preoſtes / to whom he had
ſolde hym the Wedneſday byfore / as it is ſeide / and
aſked of hem companye to take hym.</P><P>¶ And in the mene tyme oure lorde Jeſu made this
forſeide longe and worthy ſermoun to his diſciples.  Of
the whiche profitable ſentence / firſte commendynge pees
to his diſciples / we mowe vnderſtonde alle the effecte
comprehended ſchortly that he enfourmed hem ſpecially
and betauȝte to hem with pees thre principal vertues / that
is to ſeie: feithe / hope / and charite.  Firſte he bytauȝt to
hem charite ofte ſithes and moſt beſily whan he ſeide: <FOREIGN>Mandatum
nouum do vobis</FOREIGN> / I ȝeue ȝow a newe maundement /
and that is that ȝe loue to gidre / <FOREIGN>vt diligatis inuicem.  In

they ſchulde trewely kepe this charite by worchynge in

mandata mea ſeruate</FOREIGN> / ȝif ȝe loue me / kepeth myn heſtes.
And alſo after: <FOREIGN>Qui diligit me / ſermonem meum ſeruabi</FOREIGN>t /
whoſo loueth me / he ſchal kepe my worde / <FOREIGN>et pater

we ſchulle come to hym and dwelle with hym.  And in
other dyuerſe places ſpecially he commendeth to hem
charite and pees as a principall byqueſt in his teſtament
at this tyme / as the proceſſe of the goſpel telleth.</P><P>¶ In feithe alſo he enformed hem and ſtabled hem
more perfitely in byleue of his godhede / ſeienge in theſe
wordes: <FOREIGN>Non turbetur cor veſtrum neque formidet</FOREIGN> / be
not ȝoure hert troubled and drede it not: <FOREIGN>Creditis in deum
et in me credite</FOREIGN> / for as ȝe byleuen in god / ſo ȝe moſte
byleuen in me.  And after he tauȝt hem in this byleue /
that the fader and he ben one god / and thouȝ he be leſſe
than the fader after the manhede / neuertheles he is euere
euene with the fader after the godhede· and therfore he
reprehendith Philippe that badde hym ſchewe hem the fader
/ and ſeide: <FOREIGN>Qui videt me / videt et patrem</FOREIGN> / that whoſo
ſeeth me / ſeeth the fader.  And after in concluſioun of
this feithe he ſeide to his diſciples: <FOREIGN>Non creditis quia ego
in patre et pater in me eſt?</FOREIGN> leue ȝe not that I am in the
fader and the fader is in me?  <FOREIGN>Alioquin propter opera ipſa
credite</FOREIGN> / elles for tho werkes that ȝe ſeen byleueth.</P><P>¶ In hope alſo he comforted hem in many maneres:
and firſte touchynge the effecte of preyere / ſeyenge to
hem in theſe wordes: <FOREIGN>Si manſeritis in me / et verba mea in<EPB/><PB N="213" ID="pb.216"/>

ȝif ȝe dwelle in me and my wordes abyden ſtedfaſtly in
ȝow / what ſo euere ȝe wole aſke it ſchal be ȝouen ȝowe.  Alſo
he comfortede her hope aȝenſt tribulaciouns and hate of
the worlde / ſeyenge thus: <FOREIGN>Si mundus vos odit / ſcitote
quia me priorem vobis odio habuit</FOREIGN> / ȝif the world hate

ſo forthe as the tixt telleth / comfortynge her hope in
pacience of perſecucioun by enſaumple of hym ſelfe that
was her lorde.  In the thridde manere he comforted hem
to hope with oute deſpeyre by cauſe of the withdrawynge
fro hem of his bodily preſence / tellinge hem bifore that
they ſchulde haue grete ſorwe for the abſence of hym
thoruȝ his harde deth / but afterwarde that ſorwe ſchulde
be torned into endeles ioye by his glorious reſurreccioun
and aſcencioun to the fader / and ſendynge of the holy
gooſt to hem· the whiche ſouereynly ſcholde comforte
hem in alle diſeſe and teche hem alle ſothefaſtneſſe.  And
than he concluded in thiſe wordes: <FOREIGN> Hec locutus ſum
vobis / vt in me pacem habeatis</FOREIGN> / alle thiſe wordes forſeide
I haue ſpoken to ȝow / vnto that ende that ȝe haue pees in

the fader / liftynge vppe his louely eiȝen to heuene / and
commendynge firſte hym ſelf after the manhede / and after

not only for hem / bot alſo for all hem that ſchulde

Sothely he prayeth the fader / ȝif it be his wille that he be

And therfore / my lorde / what deme ȝe now in this

I will in all manere the hele and ſaluacioun of ſoules· and

than ſaide the aungel to hym: Beth now of good comfort

ſo ſolempne and ſo ioyeful a feſte / ne neuere perauentre
ſchal be / but at the laſte after the day of dome / when alle

of this chapitre / this ſollempnite / alle thinges conſidered
/ paſſeth alle othere.  Take hede of eche of hem /
and ſee whether it be ſooth that I ſeie: Firſt / the Incarnacioun
of oure lorde Jeſu is a ſolempne feſte and worthi·
for that was the bygynnynge of alle oure gode and oure
ſauacioun: but that was oure ioye and not his / for he
was thanne cloſede in his moder wombe.  Alſo the
Natiuite of hym is a ſolempne and hiȝe feſte / and worthily
merthe to be made therynne: but that is alſo as on oure
ſide / for as on his ſide we oweth to haue compaſſioun
of hym that was for vs borne in ſo greet pouert / hardneſſe
of weder / and other abieccioun.  Alſo / as to vs his
paſſioun is a grete feſte / thoruȝ the whiche we bene
brouȝt out of the fendes thraldom / and alle oure ſynnes
ben forȝeuen and done aweie· and / as ſeynt Gregor
ſeith / hit hadde nouȝt availled vs to be born / but hit hadde
alſo profited vs forto be bouȝt.  Neuertheles for the grete
tormentis of hym / and that hardeſt and moſte deſpitous
deth that he ſuffrede for oure redempcioun and bieng /
there was thanne no mater of ioye / but rather of ſorwe·
bothe to hym in that peynfull ſuffrynge / and to vs for<EPB/><PB N="294" ID="pb.297"/>
oure ſynfull deſeruynge.  Ferthermore ȝit / the reſurrexioun
of our lorde Jeſu is a gloriouſe / ſolempne / and
ioyful feſte bothe for hym and for vs· for than was his
body glorified and alle peyne and ſorwe paſſed / and we
iuſtified / and haue an erneſt and enſaumple withouten
dowte alſo of oure laſte vpriſynge in body and ſoule.  And
therfore of this worſchipful and ioyful day ſpecially
ſyngeth holy chirche by the wordes of the prophete
dauid: This is the day that oure lorde made· be we
mery theryn and glad.  And as ſeynt Auſtyne ſeith in
a ſermoun: This day is holyeſte of alle othere.  But that
may be vnderſtonde of alle othere bifore that day: for
this day of the Aſcencioun by reſoun is grettere and
holyere· and that touchynge thre partes· that is to ſeie /
oure lorde hym ſelf / the bleſſed ſpiritis in heuene / and
mankynde in erthe.  For as to the firſte: thowh oure
lorde hadde thanne gloriouſly in body and ſoule vpriſen
fro deth to euerelaſtyng lyfe· neuertheles he was bodily
ȝit as a pilgryme in erthe / fro his owne kynde heritage
and rewme.  Alſo as to the ſecounde: ȝit ſeie not the
aungeles here felawſchip encreſede by ſeyſone taking of
mankynde with hem in bliſſe.  And as anentis the thridde:
ȝit was cloſed and ſtoken the ȝate of heuenly paradys·
and ȝit were not the holy fadres and ſoules preſented to
the fader of heuene.  The whiche all thre were complete
and fulfilled in this holy aſcencioun.  And if we take
good hede we mowe ſee that all that god wrouȝte and
dide / he dide forto come to this ende· and withoute
this alle his werkes hadde be as imperfite.  For loo /
heuene and erthe and all that is made in hem is made
for man / and man forto haue the bliſſe of heuene· and
therto myȝt no man come after he hadde ſynned in to
this day / were he neuere ſo good and riȝtwys.  And ſo<EPB/><PB N="295" ID="pb.298"/>
we mowe ſee how worthy this holy day is.  Ȝit more ouer
the feſte of Pentecoſt is hyȝe and holy / and worthily holi
chirche maketh it ſolempne· for than was ȝeuen therto
that hyȝe worthyeſte ȝifte / that is the holy goſte: but
this is to vs and nouȝt to hym.  But this aſcencioun day
is propurly the moſte ſollempne feſte of oure lorde Jeſu·
for this day firſt in his manhede he bygan to ſitte on the
faderes riȝt hande in bliſſe / and toke ful reſte of all his
pilgrymage bifore.  Alſo this is propurly the feſte of alle
the bleſſed ſpirites in heuene· for this day they hadde
a newe ioye of her lorde / whom they ſeie neuere bifore
there in his manhede.  And alſo for this day bygan firſt
to be reſtored the fallynge doun of her felawes / and that
in ſo grete multitude and noumbre of bleſſid ſoules of
patriarkes and prophetes and alle tho holy ſoules that this
day firſt entrede in to that bliſſed citee of heuenly Jeruſalem
/ here kynde heritage aboue.  Wherfore ſithen we
maken ſollempne the feſte of one ſeynte that is paſſed out
of this worlde to heuene / miche more we oweth to do of ſo
many thowſandes / and ȝit paſſyngly of hym that is ſeynte
of alle ſeyntes.  Alſo this is ſpecially the feſte of oure
lady· for alſo moche as this day ſche ſeye hir bliſſed ſone
Jeſu / verrey god and man / ſo gloriouſly crowned as
kyng / ſtey vp to heuene.  Ȝit alſo this is propurly oure
feſte· for this day was firſte oure kynde exalted and lift
vp aboue the heuenes.  And alſo for but if criſt hadde
ſo ſteye vppe / that worthy ȝifte of the holy gooſt / wherof
we maken ſolempnyte / we myȝte not haue receyued· as
he ſeide to his diſciples: Hit is ſpedeful to ȝow that I goo
vp to the fader· for but I goo ſo fro ȝow / the holy goſt
comfortour ſchal not come to ȝow.  And therfore ſeith
ſeynt Bernard in a ſermoun of this feſte of the aſcencioun /
<FOREIGN>Sermone iiijo</FOREIGN> / in confirmacione of my forſeide ſentence /<EPB/><PB N="296" ID="pb.299"/>
that this glorioſe feſte of the aſcencioun of oure lorde Jeſu
is an ende and fulfillynge of alle othere ſolempnitees and
feſtes / and a bleſſed conclucioun of all the iourney of
oure lorde Jeſu after his manhede.  Thus mowe we
opounly ſee that this day and this feſte is moſte hiȝe
and ſolempne of alle othere.  And that ſoule that loueth
trewely oure lorde Jeſu ſchulde this day be more rauiſched
to heuene and more gooſtly ioye haue in herte thanne yn
any day of the ȝere.  For thus ſeide oure lorde Jeſu to his
diſciples: If ȝe loueden me / ſothely ȝe ſchulde be glad
and ioyful that I goo to the Fader.  Wherfore I leue that
I ſeide truely bifore / that there was neuere in heuene
a day ſo ioyful and ſo ſolempne as this day.  And ſo this
ioye and this ſollempnyte durede in to the day of pentecoſte
/ wherof we mowe deuoutely ymagyne and haue
meditacioun in this manere.</P><P>¶ The Aſcencioun of oure lorde was at the ſixte houre·
for byfore he ete with his diſciples at terce.  Thanne
mowe we thus ymagyne that thoo ten dayes fro that
houre that he aſcended in to the houre of the holy goſt
ſende / the nyne ordres of aungelles with the holy fadres
and ſoules that he toke vp with hym made hym ten
feſtes· and he aȝeynwarde rewarded hem ſpecially in ſom
ſinguler coumforte euery day.  And ſo though alle that
were thanne in heuene generally were of his aſcencioun
ioyeful / and made ſo murye a feſte that no tonge can telle·
neuertheles ſpecially the firſte day fro the houre of his
aſcencioun in to ſexte of the next day folowynge aungelles
made her feſte.  The ſecounde day in the ſelf manere
maden her feſte archaungeles: the thridde day / vertues:

And ſo theſe nyne ordres of aungeles contynuede here
feeſtes in to the ſixte houre of the vigile of pentecoſt·
and fro thennes in to terce of the day folwyng / that is of
the ſonday in pentecoſt / the holy fadres with here felawſchippe

god and bleſſynge oure lorde.  And whan the tenthe day
was comen fro his aſcencioun / that was the fifte day fro
his reſurrexioun / oure lorde Jeſu ioynynge the figure of
the olde teſtament with the newe / for alſo moche as the
tyme of grace was in that day come / he ſeide to the fader
thus: My fader / haueth now in mynde the byheſte that
I made to my bretheren of the holy gooſt.  And the fader
anſwerde: My dere ſone / I am wel apayde of that byheſte·
and now is tyme that hit be fulfilled.  And more

goo doun to oure diſciples / and that thou fille hem of thy
grace: coumforte hem / ſtrengthe hem / teche hem / and
ȝeue hem habundaunce of vertues and ioye.  And anon
the holy goſt came doun with a wonderful noyſe / in brennynge

gedered that tyme to gideres / and filled hem with all
ioye / vertues / and grace: by vertue wherof the diſciples
ſtrengthed / tauȝte / liȝtned / and enflawmed / ȝeden after
by alle partes of the worlde and made it ſuget to hem in
greet partie.</P><P>¶ This is a worthy feſte· and this is / among othere /
a ſwete and a louely feſte· for this is the feſte of hym that
is loue propurly / as ſeynt Gregorie ſeith / that the holy
gooſt is loue.  Wherfore he that loueth god ſchulde in
this feſte ſpecially be enflawmed with loue or / at the leſte /
with a brennynge deſire to loue.  But thus wole not bee
with fleſchely or worldly loue medled / as ſeynt Bernard
ſeith in a ſermoun of the aſcencioun in this manere ſentence:
He erreth gretely what ſo he is that weneth forto

of fleſchely likynge· or that ſwete gooſtly bawme with
this venyme· or thoo graciouſe ȝiftes of the holy goſte
with theſe foule ſtynkynge luſtes.  And no wonder / for
as the ſelf Bernard ſeith: The apoſtles for the tyme that
they hadde oure lorde bodily preſent with hem for the
loue that they hadde to his body / though it was holy and
good / ȝit for that tyme they were vnable to reſceyue parfiȝtly
the holy gooſt / as he ſeide hym ſelf: <FOREIGN>Niſi ego abiero /
paraclitus non veniet ad vos</FOREIGN> / But I goo fro ȝow / the holy
gooſt ſchal not come to ȝow.  Miche more than he that
is knitte with loue to roten mukke / or to a ſtynkynge
kareyne / is in all manere vnable to that clenneſt and ſwetteſt
loue of the holy gooſte· for there is non accorde nor
knettynge to gidre of ſothfaſtneſſe and vanyte / of liȝt and
derkneſſe / of the ſpirite and the fleſch / of fire and of

what ſchal I do thanne while I fele not that gooſtly loue?
Seynt Bernard anſwereth thus and ſeith to the: Forſake
firſte fully and truely alle veyne worldes coumfort and all
fleſchely loue and likynge / and abyde awhile in deuout

ſchalt fele withyn ſchort tyme that he ſchal come and
coumforte the bettre than thou kowdeſt byfore knowe or

worldly comfort for god / the ſame ſeynt Bernarde concludeth
in theſe wordes: The apoſtles in this abydynge
ſeten perſeueraunt with one wille to gidre in preyere

Oure lorde / merciful and mercy ȝeuere / hath made a
mynde of hiſe merueyles / in that he hath ȝeuen mete to
hem that dreden hym.  This mete is that preciouſe goſtly
mete of the bleſſed body of oure lorde Jeſu in the ſacramente
of the auȝtere / that he of his ſouereyn mercye
ȝeueth euery day in forme of brede to alle thoo that truely

he ȝeueth· and hath made therby a ſpecial mynde of his

bleſſed paſſioun / and of his merueillous reſurrexioun / and
of his merueylouſe and gloriouſe aſcencioun / and generally

of hym in his bleſſed lyf here in this worlde: the whiche
is treted in all this book bifore writen.</P><P>¶ Forto bygynne firſt at his merueylouſe incarnacioun.
Loo / hou expreſſe mynde therof is this mete that
he ȝeueth to vs in the ſacramente of the awtere· for thereynne
is he verreily / and in that ſelf body that was ſo
merueyloſly conceyuede by the holy gooſt aboue kynde /
and alſo merueyloſely born of his bliſſed moder Marye
with oute ſorwe or weme of ſynne· and ſo forth of alle
the merueyloſe werkes and dedis of hym in this goſtly

and that we haue of none othere: for all othere thinges
that we haue mynde of we conceyuen in ſpirit and in herte /
ſo that thereby we haue not the bodily preſence of hem.
But in this goſtly mete and ſacramentale commemoracioun
of oure lord Jeſu he is verrely and bodily preſent with vs
vndir another forme / but ſothely in his owne propre ſubſtaunce
verray god and man.  For what tyme he ſchulde
ſtie vp into heuene he ſeide to his apoſtles and her
foloweres in theſe wordes: Loo / I am with ȝow alle the
dayes into the worldes ende· coumfortynge hem by this
benigne promiſſe that he ſchulde dwelle with hem / not
onely by the goſtly preſence of his godhede / but alſo by
the bodily preſence of his manhede / that he ȝeueth to vs
in this forſeide mete of his fleſche and blood / but in
mynde of his meruailles generally / as hit is ſeide / moſt
ſpecialy in mynde of that bleſſed paſſioun that he ſuffrede
for vs.  For what tyme he ſchulde paſſe out of this
worlde to the fader / the nyȝt bifore his paſſioun / at that
worthy ſopere with his diſciples / as hit is ſeide bifore / he
made and ordeynede this ſouereyne and moſt worſchipful
ſacrament of his fleſche and blood / ȝeuynge his body in to

that firſte makynge of this heleful ſacrament: This dothe
ȝe in my mynde.  So that the ſouereyne and moſte
worthy mynde of his paſſioun and paſſyng loue to vs
ſchulde be euermore this hiȝe worſchippeful ſacrament.
This is that precious goſtly mete and ſpecial mynde of
oure lorde Jeſu / in the whiche is hadde all gooſtly
likynge and the ſauoure and taſte of all ſwetneſſe.  And
alſo this is that ſwete memorial / wherthoruȝ we bene
with drawen and kepte fro wickedneſſe / and coumforted
and ſtrengthed in godeneſſe / and profiten euery day in
encreſe of vertues and of grace.  In ſothfaſtnes this is
that hiȝe ȝifte and moſte noble memoriale that oweth
worthily to be prentede euere in oure mynde and to be
beſily i-kept in the ynwarde affectioun of the herte / in to
contynuele mynde of hym that ȝeueth vs this ſwete memoriale
and preciouſe ȝifte· for whos ȝifte is ofte tyme ſeene /
his mynde is likyngly prented in the herte.  Thus oure
lord Jeſu of his greet mercye hath made a likyng mynde
of his merueyles in this gooſtly mete / the whiche is moſte
merueyle of alle merueyles / ȝeuyng this mete ſpecially to
hem that dreden hym.</P><P>¶ And here we ſchole vnderſtande that in tweyne
maneres men dreden god· and there after he ȝeueth
this mete dyuerſly to hem.  For ſome dreden god as
ſeruauntes dreden her lorde / leuynge and eſchewynge
to ſynne onely for drede of peyne.  And to theſe manere
of men / if they ben oute of dedly ſynne and in grace /
oure lorde ȝeueth this forſeide mete as to here goſtly
ſuſtenaunce / but alſo to here ſouereyn likynge: ſo that
by the vertue thereof they ben ſuſteyned in lyf of ſoule and
kepte fro euere laſtynge deth.  But othere ben that
dreden god as trewe children dreden to offende here<EPB/><PB N="304" ID="pb.307"/>
fader for loue of hym.  And to this manere men oure
lorde god ȝeueth this preciouſe mete / not onely to here
goſtely ſuſtenaunce / but alſo to here ſouereyn likynge and
wonderful comfort in ſoule.  And of this manere of
dredyng folke ſpeketh the ſelf prophete Dauid / in theſe
wordes: <FOREIGN>Quam magna multitudo dulcedinis tue domine /
quam abſcondiſti timentibus te </FOREIGN>/ that is to ſeie : A lorde
god / how mykel is the manyfolde plente of thy ſwetneſſe /
the whiche thou haſt hidde to hem that dreden the.  But
they that dreden not god hauen neyther goſtly ſuſtenaunce
nor heleful likyng of this preciouſe mete / but thoruȝ
her owne wickedneſſe and vndeſpoſynge in ſoule taken
hit and eten hit to here gooſtly deth and euere laſtynge
dampnacioun.  And that bene tweyne manere of peple:
one is of hem that drede not to reſceyue this holyeſte
ſacrament in dedely ſynne / or elles by defaute of drede
contynuen in her ſynne· for as the wiſe man ſeith: The
drede of god caſteth oute ſynne: and therfore who ſo
contynueth in dedely ſynne hit is an opoun prefe that
he dredeth nouȝt god· and than is he vnable to reſceyue
and helefully ete this worthy ſacrament.  Another manere
peple that lakken the drede of god ben heretikes· the
whiche in defauȝte of boxum drede to god and holy
chirche / preſumptuouſly lenynge vppon hir owne bodily
wittes and kyndely reſoun / leuen not that holy doctoures
hauen tauȝt and holy chirche determynede of this bleſſid
ſacrament / but falſely trowen and obſtynately ſeien that it
is brede in his kynde as it was byfore the conſecracioun·
ſo that the ſubſtaunce of brede is not turnede
in to the ſubſtaunce of goddis body / but dwelleth ſtille
brede as it was byfore / by cauſe that it ſemeth ſo to alle
her bodily wittes.  The whiche errour and hereſye / and
alle othere of this holyeſte ſacrament / with oute doute<EPB/><PB N="305" ID="pb.308"/>
ſpringen of gooſtly pryde / and preſumpcioun of kyndely
witte / in defaute and lak of lowely drede.  For outher
ſuche men leuen that god may worche alle thoo merueyles
abouen the comune courſe of kynde / as holy chirche
techeth in this holy ſacrament / or nouȝt· and ȝif thei
leue not that he may / thanne dreden they hym nouȝt
as god all myȝti· and ſo ben they worſe than Jewes or
ſarecenes· for bothe byleueth that god is almyȝty.  And
on the tother ſide if thei ſeien and leuen that god for he is
all myȝty may worche tho meruayles / but they leue not
that he doth ſo for alſo moche as here kyndely reſoun
telleth hem the contrarie / thanne drede they not forto
aȝeyn ſeie the ſouereyn goodneſſe and loue of god to mankynde
/ as in that partye that holy chirche techeth and
byleueth of this holy ſacrament· and in that they preue
hem ſelf gret fooles.  For thouȝ it were ſo that it were
in doute / whether the techynge and the byleue that holy
chirche hath of this holy ſacrament were ſothe or nouȝt /
or elles alſo ſette caſe that hit were not ſothe· ȝit the ſiker
parte were to byleue as holy chirche techeth with a
buxome drede.  For in that we leuen oure owne kyndely
reſoun / and ben obeyſaunt to god and holy chirche / as
hym ſelf biddeth vs· and alſo we withdrawen not in oure
byleue of the myȝt of god / nor of his loue and ſouereyn
goodneſſe to vs / but rather maken it more / if hit ſo were
that hit were not ſooth as we byleuen and that were litel
perel or rather none / but mede to vs in alle partes for
oure good wille to god and holy chirche.  And alſo in
that byleue there is none perile of ydolatrie / as the falſe
heretikes ſeith that we honouren and maken brede oure
god· for we ſeien and byleue that in that holy ſacrament
brede is turned into goddis body by vertu of criſtes
wordes· and ſo we honoure not brede but all holely god<EPB/><PB N="306" ID="pb.309"/>
and his bleſſed body in forme of brede / that is to ſeie in
that likneſſe of brede that we ſene with oure bodily
eyȝen: we honouren goddes body that we ſene by trewe
byleue in ſoule with oure goſtly eyȝen.</P><P>¶ Thus we hauinge loue drede of god / and ſtandynge
ſtedfaſtly in the byleue that holy chirche hath tauȝt vs
ſpecially of this holyeſte ſacrament / we ſchulle conſidre
and ynwardly byholde to kyndelynge and noriſchynge
of oure loue to oure lorde Jeſu / that ȝeueth vs of his hiȝe
grace this preciouſe mete of his bleſſid body / the merueyles
that he maketh and worcheth therynne / ſpecially
in tweyne maneres: that is to ſeie / in one manere euery
day priuely / wherof we haue knowynge onely by beleue
with ynneforthe: and alſo in another manere ſomtyme
openly / wherof we haue knowynge by trewe tellynge of
myracles with outeforth ſchewed.</P><P>¶ Touchynge the firſte manere of merueyles: hit is a
ful greet merueyle that by vertue of criſtes wordes brede
is turned in to goddes body / and wyne in to his blode.
And to ſtrengthe vs in byleue of this merueyle we ſchole
haue in mynde that he with the ſelf myȝt of his worde
made all the world of nouȝt· and of the ribbe of Adam
made Eue in fleſche and blood· and turnede the wyf of
loth in to an ymage of ſalte· and moyſes ȝerde tornede
in to a ſerpente· and the welles and wateres of Egipte
turnede in to blode.  Wherfore ſithen god all myȝty wrouȝte
alle theſe merueyles and many moo aboue the reſoun
of man and the comune curſe of kynde· why may he
not alſo by the ſelf myȝt turne brede in to his body?  There
is non reſoun to preue the contraire but if we wolde ſeie
that god were not all myȝti / that god forbede.</P><P>¶ Alſo hit is a grete merueyle that the ſelf body of oure
lord Jeſu / that ſitteth in heuene vppon the fader riȝt half/<EPB/><PB N="307" ID="pb.310"/>
is verreyly and holely in alle places of the worlde where
this holy ſacrament is treted / ſothely contynede in that
ſacrament in that ſelf fleſche and blode / that was conceyuede
of the holy gooſt / and borne of the bleſſed
virgyne Marye / and henge vppon the croſſe for oure
ſauacioun.  This may not be comprehended fully by
mannis reſoun / but onely ſtondeth in byleue.  Neuertheles
there is a manere of like merueyle in kynde: that
a word ſpoken of one man to myche peple is holy in hym
that ſpeketh hit / and alſo in alle tho that heren hit / be
they neuere ſo manye.  Hit is alſo a greet merueyle that ſo
grete a body of oure lorde Jeſu is fully and holy comprehended
in ſo litel a quantite of the hoſte· and therwith
alſo if that hoſte be departed in to many ſmale partes
hit is as fully in euery parte as hit was in all the hole.
Hereto alſo is a manere likkeneſſe that we ſene in kynde:
how the ymage of a mannis grete face and of a grete body
is ſene in a litel myrour· and if it be broken and departed /
ȝit in euery parte hit ſemeth al the hole ymage / and not
in partie after the partes of the glaſſe ſo broken.</P><P>¶ Many othere wonderful merueyles oure lorde god
all myȝty worcheth in this preciouſe ſacrament / of his
endeles mercy / to oure gooſtly comfort and hele of ſoule·
the whiche we mowe not comprehende by kyndely reſoun
and oure bodily wittes / but onely by trewe byleue.  And
therfore hit is greet folie and goſtely perile to ſeke curiouſely
in ymaginacioun of reſoun the merueyles of this worthy
ſacrament.  But hit is moſte ſiker / namely to a ſymple
ſoule / and ſuffiſeth to ſauacioun touchynge the forſeide
merueyles and alle othere of this bleſſed ſacrament to
thynke and fele in this manere.  Thus hauen holy doctours
tauȝt and holy chirche determynede· and therfore thus I
trowe and fully byleue that it is in ſotheneſſe / thouȝ my<EPB/><PB N="308" ID="pb.311"/>
kyndely reſoun aȝeyn ſeie it.  For as ſeint Gregory
techith / that feith hath no merite to the which mannes
reſoun ȝeueth experience.</P><P>¶ Touchynge the ſecounde manere of merueyles and
meracles ſchewed with outeforth by vertue of this holy
ſacrament and in this holy ſacrament / as we fynden wreten.
For thre ſkilles oure lorde ſchewed in dyuerſe maneres tho
myracles and merveiles in this precious ſacrament· that
is to ſay / ſomtyme to comforte hem that bene in trewe
beleue of this bleſſid ſacrament / and to kyndele her loue
therby more feruently to god and to worſchippynge of that
ſacrament: alſo ſomtyme be ſpecial grace forto conuerte
and turne to trewe beleue hem that bene out therof: and
alſo ſomtyme to open preef of grete vertu therof in deleueraunce
of peynes and ſauyng fro bodily meſcheef and
gooſtly.  And of yche of theſe thre I ſchall telle ſchortly
ſome merveyles and myracles that I ſynde wreten· the
whiche ben of ſo grete auctorite / as to my felynge / that
ther may no man aȝenſtonde nor agaynſay hem but he be

ſomtyme ſcheweth openly myracles and merveyles of this
bleſſid ſacrament to comforte hem that leuen in trewe

loue of god.  We fynde writen in the lyf of the holy confeſſoure

cleped leueriche / the whiche with his noble wyf Godeȝue

kyng / with loutynge of his heed honourynge the preſence
of goddes mageſte / mekely with all the body dede Reuerence
to ſo worthy a bleſſynge.  But the Erle that ſawe
that ſelf ſight / noght knowyng what was in the kynges
herte / and alſo deſirynge that the kyng ſcholde be partyner
or parceyuer of that grete and ſo worthi a ſight /
bygan to goo toward the kyng fro his place / that was
perauenture aſide benethe / as longid for his aſtate.  But
the kyng / vnderſtonding what was his entente / ſeide to
hym in this manere: Stonde / lyveryche / ſtonde! for
that thou ſeeſt / I ſee alſo.  After this they bothe / of ſo
ioyfull a ſight gooſtely comforted and turned all in to
devoute prayer and ſwete wepynge teres / weren made
gooſtly dronken of the plente of goddis hous / and fedde
with the ryver of his ſouereyne ioye and gooſtly likynge.
And after the ende of the meſſe they that weren ſo bliſſfully
refetid with that gooſtly mete comuned to gedre of
that forſeide heuenly ſiȝt / with ſwete teris and ynward
ſyghynges ofte ſithes brekyng her ſpeches.  And than
ſeide ſeynt Edwarde: My dere lyveriche / I preye the and

Erle was goon fro the kynges courte / by the inſpiracioun
of the holy gooſt / as it is to beleue / he was taught ſo
that he kepte the biddynge and the heſte of his lorde.
And ȝit therwith that hye vertuous myracle ſcholde not be

blynd and ſeke in the feith / I vſed to ſynge my meſſe
boldely and dredde not to trete and receyue that worthi
ſacrament of criſtes precious fleſche and blode.  And
vppon a day / as I was at my meſſe in tyme of conſecracioun
/ fel to my mynde the grete horrible ſynne that I<EPB/><PB N="314" ID="pb.317"/>
hadde ſo longe tyme contenued inne· and amonges
othere wrecchid thouȝtis of my blynde herte / I thouȝt
in this manere: Loord / whether that precious body in
fleſche and blood of my lord Jeſu / that is clepid briȝtnes
of euerlaſtynge lyf / and that gooſtly mirrour of the godhede
with oute wemme / is now made / treted / and
receyued verreyly of me / ſo foule and abhomynable
ſynner.  And ſo hauyng in mynde ſweche vnthrifty thouȝtis /
when it come to the tyme of the fraccioun / and as the
vſe is I hadde broken the hooſte in two / anone freſche
blood ran out therof· and that parte that I helde in myn
honde was turned in to fleſche and all ouer wette with
reed blood· and therwith I / ſeynge al this / was al
aſtonyed and abaſchid and wel nere oute of my witte and /
ſo as forloſte the counſele of al reſoun / alle that I helde
in myne handes I lete falle downe in to the chalice.  There
was than to ſee / and ȝit now is / a wonderful myracle:
that is to ſeyne wyne turned openly to mannis ſight in to
blood / and brede in to fleſche / declarynge expreſſely the
foorme and the ſoothneſſe of that bleſſid ſacrament.  Furthermore
/ he ſeide / whan I ſawe theſe manere of likneſſis
abyde ſtille / with oute anye turnynges or chaungynges /
I durſte no more touche hem / but priuely I hilede the
chalice with the patene and the patene with the corporaſe.
And after the meſſe was done and the peple awey paſſede /
I ſette the chalice with the holy relyques / that ȝit in to
this daye beeth contenede therynne / in a convenient
place beſyde the awtere / with due reuerence to be kept.
After this I went to the pope and made to hym myne
confeſſioun· with ſothfaſt tellynge of al the caſe byforeſeide
/ and of al my ſynne.  And after he hadde enioyned
me penaunce and dewe ſatiſfaccioun / he aſſoillede me /
and let me goo.  And ſo aftir the myracle pupliſched and<EPB/><PB N="315" ID="pb.318"/>
knowen there comen fro dyuers contrees mykel folk to
ſee tho preciouſe relikes· with grete reuerence magnyfieng
oure loord Jeſu / that alone wircheth ſuche hye
merveyles.</P><P>¶ And than at the ende / the forſeide preeſt preyde the
clerkes of ſeynt hughe / to the whiche he tolde all the forſeide
tale / that they wolde alſo telle it to hym / ſo that he
myȝte be holpen as anentes god thoruȝ his holy prayers.
And whanne they hadde ſo done / ſuppoſynge that he
wolde with a grete deſire haue gone forto ſee the forſeide
merveyles / he anſwerde in this manere ſentence that is
worthely to be noted touchynge the feith of this holy
ſacrament: Wele / he ſeide / in the name / lete hem haue
to hem ſelf tho tokenes of her myſbileue.  What is that
to vs of theſe thinges· whether we / that euery day ſeen
with the treweſt ynnere ſight of oure ſoule alle holy and
fully this heuenly ſacrifice / hauen in merveyle the partyculers
ymages of this ȝifte of god / as who ſeith nay?
But lette hym goo ſee tho litel ſmale porciouns therof
with his bodily eyȝe / that ſeeth not alle the hole with his
ynnere goſtely eyȝe.  And whan he hadde thus ſeide /
ȝeuynge his bleſſynge to the preoſt at his goyng / afterward
he reprehended his meyne of here curioſite· and
not only ſtabled hem in byleue / but alſo declared opynly
that thoo thinges that oure feith techith vs ſchulde be
vnderſtonde and holde more certeynly of trewe byleuynge
men than thoo thinges that this erthely light by reſoun
ſcheweth to bodily ſight.  Thus oure loord of his ſpecial
grace by opoun myracles and merueyles / ſchewed in this
bleſſid ſacrament / draweth ſom folk out of here myſbyleue
and ſtableth hem and ſtrengtheth in trewe bileue / as
hit is now ſchewed in tweyne maneres.</P><P>¶ Touchynge the thridde cauſe of ſchewyng myracles<EPB/><PB N="316" ID="pb.319"/>
and merveyles in this bleſſid ſacrament / that is to opyn
preef of the grete vertu therof in delyueraunce of peynes
and ſauynges fro bodily meſchief and gooſtly / Seint
Gregory tellith in his dyaloges and alſo in a Omeleye
vppon that goſpel of luke <FOREIGN>Si quis venit ad me / &amp;c.</FOREIGN>; how
there was not longe bifore his tyme a man taken by
enemyes and lad in to fer contreyes / and there leyde
in priſoun and ſette in hard bondes longe tyme· and after
many dayes his wyf / that herde na more of hym and
ſuppoſed that he had be dede / lette ſynge euery wyke
ones a meſſe / and offred the ſacred hooſte for his ſoule·
and alſo ofte as tho meſſes were ſo done for his ſoule /
ſo ofte tymes his fetres and bondes were looſed in that
priſoun.  For longe tyme after / whan he was delyuered
out of priſoun and come home in to his owne contrey / he
tolde his wyf with grete merueylle / how that certeyn
dayes euery wyke his bondes were looſed and vndone.
And his wyf / beſily acountynge and notynge thoo ſelf
dayes / vnderſtood wele and hadde knowleche that as ofte
as ſche lete offre the ſacrede hooſt for hym / ſo ofte was he
looſed and his bondes vndone.  And thanne the forſeide
ſeynt Gregor concludith in this ſentence: Wherfore / dere
bretheren / herof in certeyn conſideracioun taketh and
gadreth in to ȝour mynde of the ſacrede hooſt / that is
offred of vs: how moche hit may in oure ſelf vnbynde the
gooſtly bonde of oure herte / ſithen that hit offrede of oon
man was of ſo grete vertue that hit myghte looſe in
anothere the bonde of his bodye.  Wherfore moche
oweth euery preeſt to loue forto ſynge his maſſe ofte
ſithes / and forto diſpoſe hym therto by clene lyf and contricioun
and confeſſioun.</P><P>¶ To the ſelf purpos alſo the forſeide ſeynt Gregor
telleth in that book cleped <FOREIGN>Dyalogus</FOREIGN> / how vppon a tyme<EPB/><PB N="317" ID="pb.320"/>
whan a biſchope was in the ſee toward Rome / and there
came vppon hym ſo grete a tempeſt that he was in
deſpeyre euere to ſcape and come to lande / the ſchipman
that was in a litel bote folowynge the ſchippe / after
that the rope wherwith the boot was bounden to the
ſchippe by violence of that tempeſte was broken / ſodenly
with the ſelf boote he was ſo caſt amonges the wawes of
the ſee that the biſſhop ſawe no more of hym.  And afterward
whan the biſſhoppes ſchippe after many periles was
dryue to lande in a certeyne Ile / the thridde day he
wente by the ſee ſide beſily lokynge whether he myȝte
haue ſeyn of the bote or of the ſchipman byfore ſeide.
But whan he myȝte nouȝt ſee of hem in any partie of
the ſee / ſuppoſynge that the ſchipman was drowned and
deed / hauynge greet ſorwe for hym he lette ſynge a maſſe
and offre the helefulle ſacrifice of goddes body for the
aſſoillynge of his ſoule.  And afterward / in the ſelf
ſchippe reſtored / he took the ſee toward Itale· and whan
he came to the hauene of Rome / there ſodeynly he fonde
alyue the forſeide ſchipman that he wende had be dede·
wherof gladde and ioyfulle / he aſked hym in what manere
he myȝte lyue ſo many dayes in ſo grete perile of the ſee.
And he anſwerde and tolde how ofte ſithes in the floodes
of that tempeſte he was caſt vp and downe / now aboue
the bote ful of water and now vnder· and at the laſte /
what for trauaylle and what for faſtynge / whan he was ſo
ouercome and nere dede that he wiſte neyther forſothe
whether he ſlepte or woke / ſodeynly hym thouȝt that one
appered to hym in myddes of the ſee and ȝaf hym brede
to ete· the whiche alſo ſone as he hadde eten he toke
ſtrengthe: and ſone after in a ſchippe that came therby
he was taken and brouȝt to lande ſaaf.  And whan the
biſſhop hadde aſked of hym and vnderſtande the day in<EPB/><PB N="318" ID="pb.321"/>
the whiche he hadde reſceyued the forſeide brede and was
refreſched / than knewe he well that it was the ſelf day in
the whiche he lete the preeſt ſynge for hym and offred the
ſacred hooſte in the forſeide yle for his ſoule.</P><P>¶ Thus ſcheweth oure loord openly by myracles and
merveyles the ſouereigne vertu of this bleſſid ſacrament·
and that not only in helpynge and ſauynge of men alyue /
as it is now here byforeſeide / but alſo / that is more to
charge / in looſyng and vnbyndynge of ſoules hens paſſid
out of the fyre and the peynes of purgatorie / as the ſelf
ſeint Gregor telleth in the forſeide book pleynly of
a monke that for the ſynne of proprete was in the
peyne of purgatorie· and after that the ſacrede hoſte
was offrede for hym thritty dayes / he was releſed and delyuered
out of peyne.  And alſo how another ſoule was
delyuered out of peyne by vertu of that bleſſid ſacrament
offred for it alle the dayes of a wyke.</P><P>¶ And here mowe we ſeen open preef of the paſſynge
profite and vertu of ſpecial meſſes done and ſongen bothe
for quyke and for dede. For as the ſelf ſeint Gregor ſeith /
the holy ſacrede hoſte ſyngulerly and ſouereignly helpeth
to vnbynde oure ſoules fro ſynne / and moſt principally
pleſeth the kyng of heuene and maketh hym ſawht to
vs whanne he cometh to deme vs· ſo that it be offred
with teris of compunccioun / and clanneſſe of herte.  For
he that in hym ſelf ryſinge fro deeth ſchal neuer dye· ȝit
by this bleſſid hooſte in his myſterie ſuffreth oft for vs.
For as ofte as we offren to hym the hooſte of his paſſioun /
ſo ofte we maken newe to vs his paſſioun to oure vnbyndynge
fro ſynne.  Thus oure lorde Jeſu / fulle of mercye /
and ſchewyng to vs ſouereynly his endeles mercye in
makynge and ȝeuynge of this moſt preciouſe gooſtly mete
of his bleſſid body / worcheth in dyuers maneres / as it is<EPB/><PB N="319" ID="pb.322"/>
ſeide / his merveyles and myracles openly ſchewed in this
excellente ſacrament and ȝit conteyneth priuely and wonderfully
there he voucheth ſaaf in hem that by trewe
byleue and loue dreden hym.  But this loue and drede
wanteth many grete clerkes / the whiche leuen ſo mykel
vppon her owne kyndely reſoun and the principles of
philoſophie / that is mannis wiſdom grounded only in
kyndely reſoun of man / that they wole not leue the trewe
feith taught by holy chirche of thes bleſſed ſacrament·
and therfore they fele not the ſothfaſt confortable effecte
of the merveylous myracles byforeſeide / neyther opoun
nor pryue / touching this holy ſacramente.  Wherfore
mychel folk is deceyued in that partie that rather ȝeuen
credence to that a grete clerk techeth acordynge to
kyndely reſoun / than to that holy chirche techeth here
of onely in byleue aboue reſoun.  For there may no man
ſonnere erre in byleue of the ſacramentis of holy chirche /
and ſpecially in this hye wonderfulle ſacrament of criſtes
precious fleſche and blood / than may grete clerkes but
they haue grace of trewe mekeneſſe and loue drede /
wherby they leue her owne witte and kyndely reſoun
and ſubmytte hem lowly by trewe byleue to the doctryne
of holy chirche.  That grace god graunte vs ſpecially of
his grete mercy in theſe laſte dayes that bene / as hit
ſemeth / nygh to the comynge of antecriſt and his diſciples·
the whiche ſchulle principally fonde to deſtroye
the trewe feith of his bleſſid ſacrament· and that by grete
clergie of mannis cunnynge / and by merueyles and
myracles worchyng / as ſeint Gregor in his morales vppon
that word of Criſt in the goſpel / ſpekynge of antecriſt and
his diſciples / ſeith in this ſentence: There ſchole riſe vp
falſe criſten men and falſe prophetes / and thei ſchole
ſchewe and worche grete ſignes and wondres· in to ſo<EPB/><PB N="320" ID="pb.323"/>
muche that they that beeth goddis choſen folk / if it may
be / ſchole be brouȝt in to errour.  Sothely / ſeith ſeint
Gregor / now oure trewe martires worchene merueyles
what tyme they ſuffren turmentis and peynes / but thanne /
that is to ſeie at the comynge of antecriſt his diſciples /
whanne they ȝeue turmentis and peynes they ſchole alſo
therwith worche merueyles.  Lete vs thanne thinke and
haue in mynde what temptacioun of mannis thouȝt that
ſchal be / whan the meke martir ſubmytteth his body
to tormentis / and neuertheles the turmentor byfore his
eyȝen worcheth myracles.  Whos vertu ſchal than be ſo
ſadly grounded in byleue that ne he ſchal be meued in
his thouȝt what tyme he ſeeth that he that tormentith alſo
therwith by ſignes and tokenes opunly ſchyneth?  For
thanne ſchal antecriſt be hye in worſchippe by merueyles
worchynge / and harde and ſcharpe by cruelte of turmentynge.</P><P>¶ Theſe ben the wordes of that holy doctour ſeint
Gregor / and many mo / ſpekynge of the wonderful myght
of antecriſt and his diſciples· and the grete temptacioun
that ſchal be in that tyme of criſten men.  And it is likly
by reſoun that as the moſte confort of oure criſten byleue
ſtant in the moſt excellent ſacrament of criſtes body / ſo
antecriſt and his diſciples ſcholen principaly worche in to
deſtruccioun firſt of the trewe byleue of this bleſſid ſacrament
in the forſeide tweyne maneres / that is to ſeie: by
clergie and euydence of worldes kunnynge acordynge to
naturel reſoun / and by merueyles and myracles worchynge
in falſe decepcioun.  And of the firſte manere
worchynge / we haue ſeyn in oure dayes how the diſciples
of Antecriſt / that ben cleped lollardes / hauen made
moche diſſencioun and diuiſioun in holy chirche / and
putte many men in to errour of this bleſſid ſacrament by<EPB/><PB N="321" ID="pb.324"/>
the falſe doctryne of her mayſter· the whiche thoruȝ his
grete clergie and kunnynge of philoſophye was deceyued
in that he ȝaf more credence to the doctryne of Ariſtotil /
that ſtant only in naturel reſoun of man / than he dide
to the doctryne of holy chirche and the trewe doctoures
therof touchynge this preciouſe ſacrament.  For Ariſtotel
techeth / as kyndely reſoun acordeth / that the accidentes
of brede or wyne / that is to ſeie the colour / the ſauour /
and ſo forth of other / mowe not be but in the ſubſtaunce
of breed or wyne after her kynde.  But the doctryne of
holy chirche is: that in this bleſſid ſacrament by ſpecial
myracle of god aboue kynde the colour / the ſauour / and
other accidentes of breed and wyn been there with oute
here kyndely ſubiecte / that is to ſeie with oute the ſubſtaunce
of breed and wyne that was byfore the conſecracioun.
And for as meche as this doctryne of holy chirche
is aȝenſt the principles of philoſophie / that is naturel
ſcience· therfore the forſeide maiſter of lollardes reprouede
hit and ſcornede hit: and ſo he errede hym ſelf
and made many othere to erre touchinge the byleue of this
holyeſt ſacrament / the whiche ȝeue more credence to hym
for the opynyoun of his grete clergie / than to the trewe
doctryne of holy chirche.  And thus ȝit in oure dayes
hath antecriſt wrouȝt in the firſte manere byforeſeide by
this falſe maiſter of lollardes / and many othere of his diſciples
/ into deſtruccioun of trewe criſten byleue touching
this bleſſid ſacrament of criſtes body / and many other
poyntis aȝenſt holy chirche / with oute the ſecounde

the whiche bileue by reſoun we ſchulde be ſo ſadly ſette
that after the ſentence of the apoſtle poule: Thogh ther
cam down an aungel fro heuene and tauȝte the contrarie /
we ſcholde not ȝeue credence to hym / but holde hym as

teche the contrarye of the byleue of holy chirche· and
therfore he that ſo dooth is the aungel of Sathanas and

the whiche haue neyther trewe drede / nor parfite loue of
oure lord Jeſu· and therfore they fele not the gooſtly
