It was encoded by Kenneth Church and mark-up was revied by Catherine Paul.</P><P>The Herrtage edition has been rearranged slightly. When a second
version of a story exists, the print edition splits the page in two,
with the primary verion appearing on consecutive tops of pages and the
second version appearing on bottoms. These stories have been brought
together at the DIV1 level, with each version contained in a DIV2.
There is a BIBL tag at the beginning of each DIV2 showing its manuscript source, and milestones reveal the manuscript pagination.</P><P>The front matter of the Herrtage edition--the title page, contents, introduction, comparative table of manuscripts, and additional notes (pp. v-[xxxiii])--have been omitted, and this electronic text begins on page one, with the opening of the Wynken de Worde edition.</P><P>In the Wynkyn de Worde edition presented herein (the last eight
stories), the moral of the story is not distinguished by a heading and
is sometimes included in the preceding paragraph. When the typography
of the chapter does not make it clear where the two parts meet, the
DIV2 and/or P have been split according to the
context, and a head supplied to indicate the beginning of the moral.</P><P>In four instances, folio markings were listed as numbered footnotes
but their corresponding number did not appear in the text itself.
This happened with text pages 225, 240, 244, and 273; these are leaf
188 col. 2, leaf 192 col. 1, leaf 191 back col 1, and leaf 198 col. 1,
respectively.  We do not have an alternative edition of this
manuscript to which to refer for placement of the milestone tags.  Milestone tags have been inserted for these leafs where it was estimated that they
would have been.</P><P>The 'sic' and 'corr' tags used in this document refer to the
changes made by the original editor, Sidney Herrtage.</P><P>The Addit.
9066 is quite similar to Cambr. MS Kk. 1. 6. The differences between
the manuscripts are provided in footnotes in the edition from which
this electronic text is taken, with the Addit. as the primary text and
Cambr.'s differences in the notes. In the electronic edition,
footnotes have been replaced by &lt;note type=variant&gt; followed by
the difference or "omitted." The * character is used as a left
boundary to the text of Addit. 9066 that is affected by the note and the
note appears at the right boundary. If no * is present before the
note, the replacement or omission is interpreted to indicate the
single word that the note follows.</P><P>Beginning on page 429 of Herrtage's edition is a series of addtional stories not given in any of the manuscripts, but present in Wynkyn de Worde's Edition (c. 1510). These have been separated from the stories presents in the manuscripts by being enclosed by a separate DIV1.</P></EDITORIALDECL></ENCODINGDESC><PROFILEDESC><LANGUSAGE><LANGUAGE ID="LAT">Latin</LANGUAGE></LANGUSAGE></PROFILEDESC></HEADER><TEXT><FRONT><TITLEPAGE><DOCTITLE><TITLEPART>THE<LB/>

Neuertheles, notwithstondyng̘ aƚƚ this, he yede

Aftir þe maister of̘ þe Shippe wolde haue layn̛

"Whens art þou, frend̛?"  "Sir," quoþ þe

and þe lion̛ wold neuer leeve him, til tyme þat

þer was no man þat wolde chalenge hem.  And then Gwido
solde þe marchauntyse, and bouȝt him tenementys and othir

þe Ape, þe whicℏ he drowe out of þe pitte,
sitting̘ in þe top of a tre, and with hire tetℏ and
with hire pawis roggyd and Rent a-downe branchis and wode, in as
mocℏ quantite as Gwido hadde nede of to charge with his asse; and
whan þe asse was chargid̛, þe ape ran to þe

and cutte a-downe wode; and thenne he sawe þe serpent come to
him, whom he helpyd owt of þe dicℏ; and she hadde in hire
mowthe a ston̛ y-colourid̛ with a threfolde colour, and she
late hit faƚƚ in þe lappe of gwido.  Whenne she hadde so
y-don̛, she kist his feet, and ran to the wode aȝen. And
thenne gwido hiely mervelid̛ of what vertu þis stone was,
and went to a stoner, and saide to hym, "good̛ man̛, I pray
þe teƚƚ me þe vertu of þis ston, and I
shaƚƚ rewarde þe for þi meede."  Thenne when þe
stoner hadde I-seyn̛ þe ston̛, he saide to hym, "I
shaƚƚ ȝive þe an C. marke for þis ston̛."
"Nay," quoþ Gwido, "I woƚƚ not seƚƚ it, tiƚƚ tyme
þat I knewe þe vertu þerof."  Thenne saide þe
stoner, "Þis ston̛ hathe iij. vertuys; the frust vertu is,
þat who so euer have <MILESTONE N="199, col. 2" UNIT="leaf"/>

Receyve þerfor as muche as it is wortℏ; For if he do
þe Contrary, þe ston̛ shaƚƚ come to him
aȝen."  And thenne gwido was glad̛ y-nowe, and saide, "in a
goode tyme I drowe out þe bestis out of þe dicℏ."
And by vertu of þe ston̛ he gate many and gret habundances
of goodis, so þat he was a grete and a myȝty man, and gret
was his possession̛.  And withInne short̘ tyme, word come to
þe Emperour, howe Gwido had a ston̛ of grete vertu.  And
þenne the Emperour sent to him, and bad̛ þat he
sholde come to him.  And when he was y-come, þe Emperour saide
to hym, "Deer̛ frend̛, I hurde telle þat þou
were some tyme in a gret pouerte, and nowe þou art a gret riche
man, thorowe vertu of a precious ston̛; I pray þe selle to

þat; For I am sikir of iij. thingis as long̘ as I haue
þat ston̛, scil. to haue ioy withoute sorowe, habundaunce
withoute defaut, and liȝt withoute derkenesse."  And when
þe Emperour hurde þis, he was þe moor̛
y-temptyd̛ to þe ston̛ then he was afore, and
þerfor̛ he saide to him in þis maner, "Chese þe
on of theise two, or to passe out of myne empire for euer, with

I woƚƚ warne þe of þe periƚƚ, scil.  þat

saide þe Emperour, "I shaƚƚ ȝive þe a M.  marke

þe ston̛, and ȝede hom, and tolde his wife of þe
bargayne.  And as soone as þey openyd̛ hire cofer, for to

When þe Emperour hurde þat, he was hiely mevid in mynde

case, for some are prowde, that they come of noble kynne, and̛
sayne they are Gentilmen̛.  But forsothe and̛ we be-holde

There come to hym̛ a riche man̛ and̛ a good̛

arte a Gentilman̛ on thy Fadres syde, but thy modre was a

the Eyre was with a byshope. the byshope mych worshipped̛ the

"sir," he seide, "if̘ here had̛ ben̛ a good̛ Eyre,

when̛ he was sekere of this maner, and̛ had̛ it in his

oon̛ of his knaues. se then̛, Frendes, here is a falle! for
alse longe as he myght gyve, he was had̛ in worship, but when his
