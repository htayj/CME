Sidon went into hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> warderop and sche made [come] a damesell named Ellious, the whiche sche loved myche and trusted vnto more than to any othi<ABBR>r</ABBR>, and she said to hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> that she hade grete desi<ABBR>r</ABBR> to se the fai<ABBR>r</ABBR> childe Ponthus, of whome all men spake.

<P>Then the knyght kneled doune and said, "Ma dame, I crie you mercy, and be <MILESTONE N="169b."

<P>The senysshall went his way to fetche hym. Sydon went <MILESTONE N="5"/> into hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> warderopp to loke att the wyndowe, if she myght se hym come.

<P>The Erle said, "Ay swete frende, howe durste ye come thus, for if ye we<ABBR>r</ABBR> asspyed, ye be bot deid."

<P>"The<ABBR>r</ABBR> be nomore to doo," said the knyght, "bot lete ordayne you<ABBR>r</ABBR> battelles and putt theym the<ABBR>r</ABBR> as I shall tell you <MILESTONE N="20"/> in oon p<HI REND="italic">ar</HI>tie."

<P>And when the Erle of Destrue sawe his sonne Pollides, which was a fai<ABBR>r</ABBR> knyght, he blessed hym and said, "This assemblye be made by ou<ABBR>r</ABBR> Lorde Ih<HI REND="italic">es</HI>u Criste, which has gyven vs grace to fynde the ryght lorde of this contrey." <MILESTONE N="30"/> And then he said, "Lordes, ordayne you in array, <MILESTONE N="193."

<P>Then the Erle toke his leve and dep<HI REND="italic">ar</HI>ted and come to the toune ryght erly. He come to the kyng as man affrayd; the kyng rose vp, and he saluyd hym by Mahounde; and then he said vnto the kyng, "Se<ABBR>r</ABBR>, the Cristen be comen to robbe and <MILESTONE N="10"/> to pyll the contrey, and they be bot a leke from the toune." "Be they mony?" said the kyng.

"Ay S<HI REND="italic">er,</HI>" said the Erle, "ye shuld not beleve in dremes." "Ye say sothe," said the kyng. "Goo and make to bloo trumpettes and doo crye that eu<HI REND="italic">er</HI>y <MILESTONE N="20"/> man arme hym.

"Ye say wele," said the Erle, whiche thoght that itt shuld not be so.</P>
<P>The Erle went furth and armed hym and made to crye that <MILESTONE N="25"/> eu<HI REND="italic">er</HI>y man shuld arme hym. So eu<HI REND="italic">er</HI>y man armed hym and leped on hors bak.

<P>Ponthus had ordaned his batelles and had sett in a valey iiij thovsand men of armes for to fall betwene theym and the toune. And S<HI REND="italic">er</HI> Patryke come with v hunderyth men into a

<P>The kyng smote his hors with the spurres on that partie whe<ABBR>r</ABBR> as he sawe the smoke and loked to the see and sawe not past lx schippes, and said, "Nowe on theym!

And yitt he ordaned so that a grete partie was in orden<HI REND="italic">au</HI>nce, for he was a wyse knyght and a hardye in armes; and as he made an orden<HI REND="italic">au</HI>nce, he herd a grete crye betwen hym and the toune and sawe his men flee toward hym. Then he said, "There is <MILESTONE N="15"/> noo fleyng. Rynne we vpon [theym] sharpely." So he smote his hors with the spurrys and assemelyd with the batelles. So he iusted with Geffray de Lazynyen, the whiche was not all redye, and they gave grete strokes. Bot the kyng toke Geffray at a trave[r]s and ou<HI REND="italic">er</HI>threwe hym.

So the<ABBR>r</ABBR> was stronge batell betwen theym, for the kyng was ryght strong and of grete hertt; bot Ponthus gave hym so mony strokes that he mad hym all astoned and to stowpe; and then he cutted the lases of his helmete, and then the kyng had bot litle strenght <MILESTONE N="15"/> to endure.

<P>Sydone was all abasshed, and thoght in hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> hert that it was not the furst treson and falsnes that he had doone.

<P>So he come into hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> chaumbre and when he fonde hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> not, <MILESTONE N="5"/> he serched the warderoppes, whe<ABBR>r</ABBR> as he did fynd a gentyll∣woman, the whiche tolde hym that she was withdrawn into the toure, and how she had vitelled it and stuffed it; and when he herd that, he luked as a wodeman and come before the toure and p<HI REND="italic">ra</HI>yd hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> full fayre to open hym the dore, and <MILESTONE N="10"/> swore by his feith that he wold not mysdoo hi<ABBR>r</ABBR>.

<P>So he toke the kyng and put hym in p<HI REND="italic">ri</HI>sone, for fere that he shuld gedre men of armes aganes hym; and then he come to the burges and said vnto theym, howe Sydone was yeven hym of hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> husbonde by goode l<HI REND="italic">ett</HI>res, and also the kyng hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> fadre was accorded therto by cause that she wold <MILESTONE N="25"/> haue ben weddyd to a man of noght, which wolde haue hated and dystroyed the contree; "bot," said he, "if that I haue hi<ABBR>r</ABBR>, I shal kepe you<ABBR>r</ABBR> fraunches and you<ABBR>r</ABBR> libertees and I shall kepe you as the gold doos the stone.

And also he had mony straunge souldeoures.</P>
<P>When he had spoken to the burges and to the people, he <MILESTONE N="5"/> come to the toure and assaled itt. So the<ABBR>r</ABBR> was within bot v men a[nd] fou<ABBR>r</ABBR> wo<HI REND="italic">m</HI>men, that threwe doune grete stones and defended wele the toure.

The sawte lasted a grete while and Guenelete had <MILESTONE N="10"/> fayled of his entente; so he was ryght sorofull and angree and thoght at the lest he wold famyshe theym. "In goode faith," said Sydone, "we haue vytell enughe for a monethe day, and in the meane tyme God may helpe vs and sende vs rescouse." When Guenelete vnd<HI REND="italic">re</HI>stode hi<ABBR>r</ABBR>, he went to haue <MILESTONE N="15"/> ronne wode for angre; for he was half dystrakked <MILESTONE N="197b."

<P>And then he bethoght hym of a grete malice, for he come to the kyng and p<HI REND="italic">ra</HI>yd hym to goo to his doght<HI REND="italic">re,</HI> for he knewe wele that he myght turne hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> of hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> folye that she has taken on honde; and tolde hym that he wold not famyshe hi<ABBR>r</ABBR>, <MILESTONE N="25"/> bot fall into a tretee.

<P>Guenelete asked the kyng, that he sawe aboue at the wyn∣dowe, "S<HI REND="italic">er,</HI> what wolle she doo?" "So helpe me God," said <MILESTONE N="5"/> the kyng, "I may not spede, for she be yitt all sorowfull and angree for hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> lorde, wherfor I may haue no goode answe<ABBR>r</ABBR>." "No!" said Guenelete, "by the faith that I owe to God, ye shall abyde with hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> and be<ABBR>r</ABBR> he<ABBR>r</ABBR> fellishipp, forto ete pesen and ploumes; for ye shall bot <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">W, <HI REND="italic">bothe.</HI> R, <HI REND="italic">tous deux.</HI></NOTE> twoo dye for hungre, bot <MILESTONE N="10"/> if I may haue hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> fellysshipp." So the kyng abode with his doghtre, wherfor she had the titte<ABBR>r</ABBR> pitee for the hungre and the dysease of hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> fadre.

She loked often tymes oute at a wyndowe toward the citee and the see, if she myght se any thyng. So she wyshed ofte tymes aftre Ponthus and then she weped and made myche sorowe, desyryng hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> awn dethe, and said to the kyng, "Ay my lorde, it had ben bettre for you that I had ben <MILESTONE N="25"/> deid long agoo, then ye to soffre suche payne and so myche hungre for me." The kyng weped and sayd, "I had leu<HI REND="italic">er</HI> dye for hungre then to se yonde traitou<ABBR>r</ABBR> gete you by this meane." Sydone called hym,—"Fals traitou<ABBR>r</ABBR> and vntrewe, howe may thou soffre the kyng to dye, that is so trewe <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">W, <HI REND="italic">good.</HI> R, <HI REND="italic">bon.</HI></NOTE> a <MILESTONE N="30"/> man?

<P>The kyng was almost deid for hungre and lay in his bed and myght not styrr<HI REND="italic">e.</HI> And when Sydon behelde hym she said that she we<ABBR>r</ABBR> leu<HI REND="italic">er</HI> to dye, or to sorowe all hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> live then <MILESTONE N="5"/> to see hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> fadre dye for hi<ABBR>r</ABBR>.

The kyng weped and wyst not what to say; forto <MILESTONE N="10"/> see that he shuld haue hys doghtre by this way, it greved hym sore, and on that othre side, to see hym selfe and hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> to dye to gedre, itt did hym grete harme, for she shuld be cause of hi<ABBR>r</ABBR> awn dethe. So he sorowed sore and said that he had to long lived. So he couthe not councell hym self and said <MILESTONE N="15"/> vnto hi<ABBR>r</ABBR>, "Fai<ABBR>r</ABBR> doghtre, I wote not how we may doo. I ne wote what counsell I may yeve you—so myche sorowe I haue, bot to see you dye, I may not see it; and I wold that the dethe toke me, so that Ponthus we<ABBR>r</ABBR> in this toune on live on the strong p<HI REND="italic">ar</HI>te, for he wold venge hym wele on the trai∣tou<ABBR>r</ABBR> <MILESTONE N="20"/> that wold have you agane you<ABBR>r</ABBR> wyll."
