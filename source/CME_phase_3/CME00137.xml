<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>EARLY ENGLISH RECEIPTS FOR PAINTING, GILDING, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The old monastic artists frequently inserted in the margins or blank pages of a manuscript, receipts and directions for the different materials and processes connected with their work. These receipts deserve being collected: they are curious illus∣trations of the progress of art, and they may even afford valuable hints for modern times. The colours used in the Middle Ages were often more brilliant and durable than any we have at present. The following examples of these receipts are furnished by a manuscript in the British Museum, (MS. Harl. No. 2253. fol. 52. v<SUP>o</SUP>.,) written at the beginning of the reign of Edward II., and therefore in, or soon after, 1307.</P>

"Sinopim, colorem videlicet illum cujus tres sunt species, videlicet rubea, subrubea, et inter has media, invene∣runt primitus, ut scribit Ysidorus, viri regionis Ponticae in urbe eorum quam solent ipsi Sinopem vocitare."]</NOTE>.
