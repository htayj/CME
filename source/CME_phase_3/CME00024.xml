<HEAD>IV. SHILLINGFORD TO HIS FELLOWS. London, 2 Nov. 1447.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>He has made a present of fish to the Chancellor. The cause was adjourned till Saturday. He has spoken about it to the Justice, who urges him to make a composition, which Shillingford refuses to initiate. The cause was again adjourned till Monday, when it came before the Chancellor and the two Justices. He describes the proceedings mi∣nutely. On Tuesday All Hallows Eve he received the Answers to the City's Articles in which he is greatly libelled, desires money may be sent him, that the answers may be well understood and replied to, and that the Black Roll <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI REND="italic">Black Roll.</HI>—This was a roll containing the Customs of the City of Exeter. It was considered of great authority and value, and on it the Mayors were sworn. It was lent to Sir William Cecil in the reign of Edward VI., and is stated by Izacke (Memorials of Exeter, p. 95) and by Oliver (History of Exeter, p. 309) never to have been returned. In a paper dated 1 March, 1552-3, entitled "Remembrances for the Parliament," occurs the following memorandum about it: "Item to speke to Mr. Cicell for the Blake rolle which Griffyn leyfft in his custody." [Letters, &amp;c. among the Archives of the Corpo∣ration, No. 31.] It was delivered to Grffin Amerideth 22 Dec. 1 Edw. VI. (Act Book, ii. p. 88), but it had found its way back to Exeter in the first year of James L, for there is in the Act Book of that year (vi. p. 59) an order <Q>that the Blacke rolle shall be broght into the Council Chamber, and Mr. Chamberleyn shall write oute of the said roll into some booke in the Chamber fitt for the sam, such speciall thynges therein contained as shall be necessary, and he to be allowed for his peynes therein.</Q> Neither the copy nor the original can now be found.</NOTE> may be sent him.</P>

<P>Dowrish and Speere saw the Chancellor on the Sunday before his arrival. New bonds are ordered to be sealed to entreat for a composition till Candelmass. Dowrish and Speere were before the Chancellor on Monday; the cause was postponed. Shilling∣ford arrived in London on Tuesday, he has not seen the Chancellor yet because he waits for the "buckhorn" <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">buckhorn.—This appears to have been a kind of fish. In the Receiver's Account it is stated that 400 of bukhorn was bought to be given to the Chancellor. In the Household Account of the Countess of Devon (State Papers, Henry VIII. iii. p. 1403) amongst other fish there is an item for "6254 buckernes, 35<HI REND="italic">s.</HI> 10<HI REND="italic">d.</HI>"</NOTE> which was to be presented. Upbraids one Germyn for his negligence in not sending it.</P>

<P>The Lords before whom the matter is "in compremys" have postponed it until Candelmass with a command that the parties should endeavour to agree at home, as appears by a letter lately sent by the Chancellor to the Bisshop. The Mayor and Comonalty are ready to agree. The City did not wish to dispute the Bishop's right to the Fee. The Church and Cemetery are distinct from the Fee and not the same thing as it is now desired to be set up this last term contrary to the Bishop's first answer to the City's articles.

that my lorde of Excetre should come so, but that the seyde Mayer with other of his felowship sholde come to hym at his assignement and callyng as their parte is, and wolde w<SUP>t</SUP> right gode will to comyne after the commaundement and the entent of the seyde letter, and thought that my lord of Exceter were avysed and ruled so to come for so myche as the matter of the seide letter by my lord of Exceter was leide apart as is aboveseide, and a nywe fourme of entrety take and entred yn entrety, and the matter ajorned over by avys of bothe counseyll as hit is aboveseide.

And that hit pleased hym to assigne hym an oure the morun, &amp;c. My seide lorde seide he myght not tary, but be agone anon. The Maier seide that he cowde not comyne with hym sodenly and with so shorte avys and by hym self, and my lorde Chauncelleres commaundement was that y sholde have w<SUP>t</SUP> me at this communicacion of my felows suche as hit pleased yow. And at your commaundement my seide lorde seide y sholde take wham that y wolde, there stode right y nogh <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">ynogh—first written "ynowe."</NOTE> abowte.

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P>As to the first Article of the saide Maier Baillifs and Comy∣nalte the saide Bisshop Dean and Chapiter seyen that thei doute of Vaspasions being atte Excestre and so atte Burdeaux and Jerusalem to sille xxx Jewes hedes for a peny; and thei sey that trewe it is that the saide nowe Citee of Excestre was of old tyme a Burgh and atte all tymes hath be, and is aunceon demene, but never under the name of a citee byfore the stallacion of Leofrik in the said Cathe∣drall Chirch, first Bisshop ther stalled by the hondes of Saint Edward and Edithe his Quene, which Saint Edward cursed all such that in any wyse fro the saide Chirch withdrawett eny right or ayens the saide Chirch maligne; atte which tyme the saide Chirch Cimitery paleys and other londes and tenements longing therto were separate and distincte fro the saide Citee and no parcell therof as it appereth in the Boke of Domus Day; afore which tyme ne seth was no mayer ne fee ferme bore for the saide nowe Citee to the progenitoures of our Soverayne Lord the King unto the regne
<PB N="96" REF="124"/>
of King Henry the Thirde, butte the rentz and revenues comyng of the saide towne nowe Citee were answered to the noble progeni∣toures of our saide Soverayn Lord in their Escheker atte West∣minster as of partie of the shire of Devenshire by the honds of the Shereve of the same shere for the tyme being and by none other as it appereth by matier of recorde in the saide Escheker; atte which tyme the Bisshop of Excestre that tyme being was seised of the saide Chirch Cimitery palies lands and tenements aforsaide and all his predecessours afore him were seised of the same contynuelly fro the tyme of the saide Saint Edward; which Chirch Cimitery palies lands and tenements ben named and knowen by the name called the Bisshopes Fee, otherwyse called Saint Stephen's Fee, distincte and separate fro the saide Citee and oute of the jurisdiccion of the same, withoute that that at the dayes or many dayes setthen tyme of mynde any such Mayer Baillifs and Comminalte as thei surmytten where yn the saide Citee knowen by the name of Maier and Com∣minalte. And there as the saide Mayer and Com∣minalte seyen that they and their predecessors citezeins of the same Citee have had and hold the saide Citee in fee ferme of Oure Soverayne Lord the King that nowe is and his noble progenitours oute of tyme that no mynde is; the saide Bisshop Dean and Chapitre seyen that byfore the tyme of Richard King of Almayn which had xiii<SUP>li</SUP> ix<SUP>s</SUP> to his sustentacion atte will of his brother King Henry the Thirde and no thing ells in the saide Citee over xxv<SUP>li</SUP> xii<SUP>s</SUP> vi<SUP>d</SUP> comyng of the rent of the saide nowe Citee yeven to the hous of Crichirch in London by the graunt of King Henry the First and Malde his wif paied to them by the hendes of the saide Shereve, ther was in Excestre nether Mayer ne Baillifs ne under that name Mayer and Comminalte but an auncean demene as the saide Mayer and Comminalte have articled and the saide Bisshop Deane and Chapitre confessed; which Richard King of Almayne graunted first by the name of Baillifs and citezeinis the saide Citee to fee ferme, havyng none oper estate than is above rehersed; wherfore the saide Citee with all the appurtenaunces in King Edwardes dayes the thirde was
<PB N="97" REF="125"/>
seised in to the saide King Edward's hondes as more plainly ap∣pereth in the replicacion late made by the saide Bisshop Dean and Chapitre; in the which replicacion all other matiers of the saide Article be sufficeantly replied to as troueth asketh and requireth, as well to the jurisdiccions libertees fraunchises and power to hold plees &amp;c., as in their compleynts been comprehended, as to all other. And as to the disclaunder which the saide Mayer and Comminalte have putte upon the saide Hue Lucas, the saide Bisshop Dean and Chapitre seyen that thei know him for no such misgoverned man, neither thei knowe in no wyse of affray that he shuld make upon Richard Attewode atte the Gilde Hall dore ner of eny arrest ther upon him had after the manner and fourme that the saide Mayer and Comminalte have articled. But thei seyen that thei knowe well that the saide Hue was furiously dreven into the saide Cathedrall Chirch by officers and other of the saide Citee with swerdes daggers and other invasif wepen ayens the pees drawen, the mynysters of the saide Chirch the same tyme being in theire habits atte divine service, which mynysters as prestees ought to do in all that thei godely myght laboured to save the saide Hues lyf, being in right grete perell therof, withoute comaundement or knouleche of the saide Dean and Chapitre or eny harme doing or menyng to ony maner officer of the saide Citee or in enywise smyting eny man or mace; but one of the saide officers violently with a custrell smote one John Pawton a mynyster of the saide Chirch upon the hede, he being in his habite; by the which and other abhomynable mysgovernaunce ther made by the saide officers the saide Chirch was peluted in maner and fourme as it more pleinly appereth by the examynacion therupon had and by the Article of replicacion of the saide Bisshop Dean and Chapitre late made &amp;c.</P>

<P>Item as to the seconde Article of theire compleints the saide Bisshop saieth as he seide in his thirde replicacion &amp;c. withoute
<PB N="98" REF="126"/>
that that the saide Bisshop atte eny tymes hath had or kept eny part of such money so sette to his owne use. And there as it is supposed by the saide Maier Baillifs and Comminalte that eny such dyme which shuld be due in William Upton's tyme was with∣drawen, hit was paied and delyvered to the saide William Upton and by him receyved as depute of the Kings collectours in the shire of Devenshire by the honds of Water Hert Baillif of the saide Bisshop. And as to the paiement of eny dyme in the tyme of the saide John Cotiller, the saide Bisshop saieth that the tenants of his saide fee were not warned to come to the saide Gild Halle to the assession therof, and that the saide Maier and Comminalte assessed and sette the saide tenants, in whom thei had no such power, of malice to a importable sume otherwise then ever thei were wont to paie, so that ther would have remayned in the saide Maiers honds a grete sume therof above the saide dyme, like as there hath remayned in other Maiers honds somtyme vii<SUP>li</SUP> sumtyme C<SUP>s</SUP> and sumtyme more sumtyme lesse.
