<HEAD>Of St. George's Company.</HEAD>
<P>As this Company has been so much talked of, and con∣tinued so long, my intention is to give a full account thereof, from its first establishment to its final period and dissolution. I shall first treat of the nature and constitution of this So∣ciety; in order to which, I must begin with their first Charter (which may be thought tedious by some, though approved of by others), without which I could not have been so particular as I intend to be. I had copied this their Charter from a folio manuscript which belonged to the said Company: Book I., marked A.</P>
