<P>SELECT ENGLISH WORKS OF JOHN WYCLIF</P>
<P>EDITED FROM ORIGINAL MSS. BY THOMAS ARNOLD, M. A. OF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, OXFORD</P>
<P>VOL. II <HI REND="italic">SERMONS ON THE FERIAL GOSPELS AND SUNDAY EPISTLES. TREATISES.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NOTICE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the Introduction to the first volume was written, evidence, not hitherto noticed, has come to light, which identifies Wyclif as the author of this entire collection of Sermons beyond any reasonable doubt. This evidence consists of two distinct references made by Thomas Walden in his <HI REND="italic">Doctrinale</HI> to passages, one of which will be found at p. 78, the other at p. 364, of the first volume of this work. Walden, a Carmelite friar, confessor to Henry V, and a man of great ability, died in the year 1430; his evidence, therefore, is very nearly contemporary. In ch. 86 of Book II. of the <HI REND="italic">Doctrinale,</HI> he charges Wyclif with having multiplied his iniquity, 'concedens consequenter Spiritum Sanctum columbam, sicut septem spicae fuerant septem anni, et sacer panis est veraciter corpus Christi, immo et quodlibet esse, esse Deum.' The reader who will refer to Sermon XXX of vol. i. p. 78 will see that this is a plain discription (though not quite a fair one, for the explanatory matter added by the preacher is omitted,) of Wyclif's commentary on the descent of the dove at the baptism of Christ.</P>
<P>Again, in ch. 66 of Book III. of the <HI REND="italic">Doctrinale,</HI> Walden says, after declaring that he could with difficulty be persuaded that the Wycliffites had derived their doctrine of clerical celibacy from their master—'Tarde igitur mihi venit ad manus, quod in vulgari dicat in sermone evangelii natalis festi beati Joannis Baptistae Witcleff. Hic possum, inquit, dubitare et tractare de statu et vitâ sacerdotum, qualiter sunt dotati et innupti contra auctoritatem divinam. Nam inhibuit Christus dotem, tam in se quam in apostolis, et approbavit nuptias apostolorum pluriumque aliorum.' This is an accurate translation of a passage which the reader will find at the top of p. 364 in the first volume.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Two sections of the Sermons, published in this edition, those on the Sunday Gospels, and those on the Gospels for the Proprium Sanctorum, are thus identified with Wyclif on the authority of Thomas of Walden. But as the entire collection is found in the best and oldest MSS., and is internally connected together in various ways, the authenticity of the whole is raised to the highest degree of probability.</P>
<P>The present volume contains the remaining two sections of the Sermons, those on the Ferial Gospels, and those on the Sunday Epistles. To these are subjoined two polemical tracts, the <HI REND="italic">Vae Octuplex</HI> and the <HI REND="italic">Of Mynystris in the Chirche,</HI> which accompany the Sermons in all the best MSS., and seem to have been regarded as intrinsically a part of the collection. The miscellaneous works, properly so called, are reserved for the third volume.</P>

<P>EVANGELIA FERIALIA.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="preface">
<PB REF="19"/>
<P>[THE gospels for the Sundays and Saints' days present no difficulty to the English reader, but when he comes to the 'gospels for the ferias' he may expect some words of explanation. In ecclesiastical parlance all the days of the week, except Saturday, are ferias. The name, however, is never applied to the first day, or Sunday; but Monday is the second feria, Tuesday the third, and so on, to Friday, the sixth feria: Saturday being, in ecclesiastical language, <HI REND="italic">Sabbatum.</HI> This use of the term seems to have arisen in the following way. Among the Romans there were established feriae, or holidays; the thirty days of the Feriae Latinae, when the sacrifice was offered to Jupiter Latiaris on the top of the Alban mount on behalf of all the Latin communities, being the most important of these seasons. Among the early Christians the word soon came to be used mystically in the sense of a rest from sin (feriari a peccato), as well as in the original sense of a rest from toil and secular business. Easter, in the conception of the primitive Christian, was the central point of the year; it was the season at which, having accomplished his reconciliation with God, he com∣menced again the round of common duties and trials; and the week days following Easter day he called and kept as 'feriae,' abstaining on them from all secular work, but having undoubtedly the spiritual meaning of the term fully present to his mind also. Now just as all the Sundays in the year came to be regarded as involving a renewal on a small scale of the Paschal solemnity,—(Keble beautifully takes up the thought in his hymn for Easter day:—
<Q><L>'Sundays by thee more glorious break,</L>
<L>An Easter day in every week,')</L></Q>
so the week days throughout the year gradually came to be called 'feriae,' because the Paschal week days were so called. That Sunday should have been included numerically among the feriae must be accounted for by the influence of the spiritual acceptation of the word already mentioned; but the name of 'dies Dominica,' established since the times of the apostles, could not of course be superseded. Nor, again, could the seventh day of the week be called by any other name than 'Sabbatum,' consistently with a due reverence for the elder dispensation and the rest of the Creator; although it is practically treated as a feria for ritual purposes. (Ducange, Bingham, Wezer and Welte, <HI REND="italic">Kirchen-Lexicon;</HI> the article in Herzog is tedious and confused.)</P>
<P>All the sermons which follow, except the last five, are on gospels taken from the 'Temporale' of the Sarum missal. The last five are on gospels appropriated to a few of those special occasions, for which the same missal, in the portion of it following the Commune Sanctorum, contains a great number of separate offices.]</P>

<P>As men shulden trowe in Crist þat he is boþe God and man, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The paramount authority of the words of Christ.</NOTE> so men shulden trowe bi hise wordis þat þei ben soþe, and wordis of liif. And þus Crist in his laste departing bad hise Apostlis to preche þe gospel. And in oþer place he bad þat Petre shulde fede his sheep; not wiþ bodili fode, siþ Crist wolde þat he hadde no moneye; and Mathew telliþ how a servaunt shal come to blisse for sich fode, and prelat þat fayliþ of sich foode shal be dampned depe in helle. And Luk seiþ þat he is blessid þat heeriþ and keepiþ Goddis word; and siþ a lordis word is worshiped after þe gretnesse of þis lord, and Crist is more wiþouten mesure þan ony kyng or erþeli lord, how loveþ þe peple Crist, but <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">So in E; om.

Cursid be he <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">So E; om.

For as no word of Goddis lawe haþ ony strengþe, but as Crist spekiþ it, so no word of mannis lawe shulde be loved but if Crist speke it. For Crist is treuþe, and noo word shulde
<PB N="2" REF="21" MS="y"/>
be loved but for it is trewe. Take we noon heede to beestis skynnes, ne to enke, or oþer ornamentis, but to treuþe þat Crist spake, in which stondiþ oure bileve. For as we trowen þat Crist was man, so we trowen þat he spake þus; and his wordis myȝten not be amended, siþ he is God þat seiþ þis treuþe. And for dispite of Cristis wordis, and for defaute of love of hem, ben many men <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI REND="italic">grete men,</HI> E.</NOTE> cursid of God; for þei maken Cristis wordis unworshipid, and magnifien þer owne wordis, as þei wolden take fro God his worshipe. But, as Poul seiþ, noon shulde be trowid but aftir þat Crist spekiþ in him. As we ben certeyn of þe gospel, þat Crist, God and man, spake it, so we ben certeyn of þe treuþe, þat it is faire and profitable.</P>
<P>þis <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In G the sermon begins at this point.</NOTE> gospel of Mark bigynneþ, how Crist was teld in þe <NOTE PLACE="marg">The office of John the Bap∣tist as fore∣runner.</NOTE> olde lawe, and how al his lyf was figurid boþe in patriarkis and prophetis. þis, seiþ Mark, <HI REND="italic">is þe bigynning of þe gospel of Jesus Crist, Goddis Sone. As is writun in Isay þe prophete:</HI> Many men ben Goddis sones, taken bi grace of þer fadir; but Crist is Goddis Sone kyndely, and þe same God wiþ him. Þe Fadir seiþ to þis Sone bi Isay þe prophete: <HI REND="italic">Lo, Y sende myn angel bifore þi face, which shal make redi þi wey tofore þee.</HI> Þis aungel was Baptiste, þat witnesside þe comyng of Crist and hiȝenesse of his state, boþe to Godhede and to manhede. And sich an angel mai be clepid every good Cristen man, þat makiþ redi weie to Crist bifore Cristis laste comyng. Þis <HI REND="italic">Joon was a vois of a cryer in desert.</HI> So Joon was vois of Goddis word, and knewe mekeli his own freelte; and so Crist criede in desert, bi Baptist þat was his whistle, siþ <NOTE PLACE="marg">Is. x. 15.</NOTE> alle creatures ben instrumentis to Goddis word. For, as Isay seiþ, man is a sawe to God þat worchip.

þat þei croken not from him, ne fro þe endis þat he ordeyneþ. And þus þese newe religiouse, biside Cristis lawe, ben bi paþis; but to crokid and to foule to ony man to go to hevene, for hem wantiþ riȝtnesse þat þei feynen in þer signes. For þer signes serven of nouȝt but to crye her holynesse, þat þei ben bifore oþer chosen of God to his service; and so þei menen þat in blis þei ben <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI REND="italic">pey ben in blis,</HI> E.</NOTE> bifore seculer men. But it mai falle þat many men at þe dai of dome come bifore; and so þis Lord shal seie þanne, to shame of þes ypocritis, Ȝyve ȝe stede to þis man, and remove hem from þis boord. For alle þes ordres ben leeves of wordis, and fantasies of feyned colouris; and so þes paþis ben not riȝt, for þei leden men to ypocritis placis.</P>

For in state of innocence mannis craft shulde not serve here. <HI REND="italic">And Joon eet eerbis and hony of þe woode,</HI> as he found hem in wildernesse; and oþer housis hadde he noon but þis wildernesse and cope <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><HI REND="italic">coope,</HI> E.</NOTE> of hevene.

But as a vois bereþ þe witt of þe word wiþinne þe soule, so Baptist bare þe witt of Goddis word wiþouten error. Þis Joon hadde cloþis of þe heeris of camelis, and a girdil of skyn aboute his leendis, and þe mete of þis Joon was fruyte of þe erþe and hony of þe woode. For, as Ysay seiþ of Crist þat

siþ for tyme þat he growide he was moost growinge hooli man. And herfore seiþ Crist aftir, <HI REND="italic">But he þat is lesse in þe rewme of hevene is more þan he,</HI> for more hooli.

bisynesse aboute sich bodili mete, and more love þerof þan love of goostli mete. Crist telliþ here two skiles, to prove þat goostli mete is betere. Oon, for bodili mete mut perishe, and goostli mete lastiþ evere. Anoþer, for goostli mete bringiþ man to þe liif þat evere shal laste, but no bodili mete fediþ a man but for a tyme. Goostly mete lastiþ wiþ man, boþe here and in heven, siþ vertues bigynnen here, and ben betere in hevene wiþ man. But Crist techiþ his Godhede, whanne he seiþ þat mannis sone shal ȝyve þis mete of vertues, for þei ben of Goddis grace. Þ<HI REND="italic">is</HI> Crist <HI REND="italic">markide God þe fadir,</HI> for to ȝyve þe mete of vertues.</P>
<P>Þ<HI REND="italic">es Jewis seiden herfore to Crist, What shulen we do, for to worche Goddis werkes?

For noon bileveþ in a man, but ȝif he leeve þat he is God. <HI REND="italic">And herfore þei seiden to Crist, What signe doist þou, þat we see and trowe to þee? what þing worchist þou?

God breed <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Can the reference be to Gen. i. 29?</NOTE>. Also, þe sacrid oost is clepid breed in Goddis lawe; and þus þe myddil persone of God is breed, for he foundiþ bileve. And þus þe oost of þe auter is verri breed, to many wittis; it is breed maad of whete, and eke it is Goddis bodi; and so it groundiþ bileve, and it is an object of virtues.

An important error in the text, as printed (solely from Bodl. 788) in the first volume, can now be corrected by the help of these ad∣ditional copies.

<P>Here may we see how pryvey shrifte is auctorisid of <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI REND="italic">in,</HI> E.</NOTE> oure <NOTE PLACE="marg">Private con∣fession,</NOTE> Jesus. For but in þis place aloone men shulen not grounde þis oonly shrifte. But bi þe sentence of þe gospel, ȝif man have ful sorew for his synne, ȝif he speke not aftir oo word, but do wel and leve to synne, God forȝyveþ þis synne, as he forȝaf þis wommans synne. And neiþer gospel ne resoun mai aȝen-seie þis sentence. And so þe pope haþ newe founden a rownyng shrifte, and beden it streitly; and þis shrifte doiþ <NOTE PLACE="marg">its effects partly good and partly evil.</NOTE> sum tyme good, and also myche harm in þe Chirche; for bi þis han prelatis men undir foot, and spulen hem of worldly goodis. And þus boþe prestis and þer sugettis synnen many gatis in þis point. And þus men erren in bileve, boþe preestis and þe peple. For an hundrid pointis ben feyned of assoilinge and cursinge þat han no ground in Goddis lawe, and ȝit men doren not aȝen-seie hem. And fro þe tyme þat þe fend was unbounden, þe þridde pope Innocent brouȝte þis inne <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">At the fourth council of the Lateran, A.D. 1215.</NOTE>. And siþ þis doiþ myche good to many men to be þus shryven, and to many it doiþ harm,—and herof þei hem silf shulden be juge,—men seien þat it is nedeful to many men to be þus shryvun, but whanne and to whom men shulden be shryvun is in þer owne discrecioun. As etynge of mete is nedeful, but not ever in ech place; and maner of metis þat ben founden men shulden take after þat þei done hem good. Þe popis lawis in þis mater ben litel worþ for to trowe, but inasmyche as þei ben groundid of Goddis lawe or of resoun. And it semeþ hard þat þe Chirche shulde be nurishid wiþ newe fode, and leve fredom þat Crist haþ ordeyned, and be constreyned to take þis fode. Shryve a man him wel to God; þis suffisiþ a man to soulis helþe. And ȝit it is nedeful þat sum men shulden shryve hem þus.</P>
<P>But for þe firste part of þe gospel we shulen wite þat þer ben <NOTE PLACE="marg">Two kinds of usury, the human and the divine.</NOTE> two usuris. Summe usuren here in erþe for þer prou, and want of love; and þus usure is forfendid, for it smatchiþ coveitise. But oþer usure is ȝovun to God, whanne he ȝyveþ men his
<PB N="207" REF="226"/>
ȝiftis to profite wiþ and disserve hevene, to avantage of mennis silf. But God wole wite how men han chaffarid, al ȝif God ȝyve hem al þe vantage. And þus God usuriþ for oure prow, for alle þingis þat God ȝyveþ us he ȝyveþ us for þis eende, wheþer þei ben goodis of grace, or kynde, or goodis of fortune þat he ȝyveþ us. And of þis usure spekiþ þe gospel here, and in many oþir placis. And þus he to whom God ȝyveþ more shulde more love his God; and þis more love is encrees þat God axiþ for his ȝifte. And þus Marie Mawdeleyn ȝaf to God a greet encrees, ȝhe, more þan þis Pharisei, as she hadde more grace of God. And ȝit God axiþ þis encrees for mannis helþe, and not for his. But we shulen undirstonde here how Crist techiþ us to haunte oure mercy. As þe soule is betere þan þe bodi, so goostli werkes of mercy ben betere þan bodili mercy. And noo werkes ben werkes of mercy, but ȝif þei doon good to þe soule. And þus ȝiftis of worldli goodis blynden ful many men. For it is sum tyme a work of mercy to denye men worldly goodis, and sum tyme to take from hem, and sum tyme to putte hem in prisoun, and sum tyme to mayme hem, and sum tyme to sle hem. And God woot whanne sich dedis profiten to mannis soule.</P>

<P>[THE Sermons which follow, 55 in number, are, with two exceptions, upon the epistles (or lessons) for the Sundays throughout the year, accord∣ing to the Sarum use. The exceptions are, the sermon on the lesson for the first mass on Christmas Day (Sermon V), and that on the epistle for the Sixth day after Christmas. Sermons on the <HI REND="italic">gospels</HI> for these two days have been already printed under the head of 'Proprium Sanctorum,' (see vol. i., pp. 316 and 332). The difference in number between these that follow, and the 54 Sunday gospel sermons, arises from the fact of the last named set not containing discourses for Christmas Day and the Sixth day after, while, on the other hand, the epistle set has no sermon for the octave of the Epiphany. Throughout the series the writer follows the Sarum use. With this use the order of epistles in the English Prayer-book, as well as in the Roman missal, nearly agrees; where there is a divergence, it is pointed out at the beginning of each sermon.]</P>

For greet vertu is in þat man þat castiþ him to suffre, and kepiþ veniaunce to God, and hopiþ þat God for þis pacience wole conforte him. And herfore he is God of pacience and solace. And hereon many þenken to litil, þat fiȝten and pleden and casten weies how þei shulden be here vengid, as ȝif God knewe not þer wrongis. And so Goddis lawe undirstondiþ bi þis same þing unite, whanne men mekely knowen o Lord, and putten alle wrongis in his wille. And men þat slepen in þis þing resten surely in pees; and þis unite shulden men have bi þe lore of Jesus Crist, and þanne shulden þei be of o wille, and wiþ o mouþ herie God.

And certis þei have many mouþis þat ben amys sett upon; and siche fendis wiþ þer visers maken men to flee pees; and þes men worshipen not Crist, neiþer in his godhede ne in his manheed.

And here þenken many men, þat þes newe ordres taken not þer breþeren bi þis forme þat Crist toke us, but þei breken charite, and maken þat discord of hem makiþ discord in good love.

For ȝif he seþ, after Gregori, þat he is servaunt of Goddis servauntis, ȝit his liif reversiþ his name, for he failiþ to sue Crist, siþ he is not dis∣pensoure of service þat God haþ beden, but he partiþ þe lordship þat þe emperour haþ ȝovun. And so al services of þe Chirche þat Crist haþ lymytid to his preestis, ben turned to þe contrarie side, and so to þe service of þe fend; so þat if men taken hede to þe service of þe Chirche þat Crist haþ lymytid, it is al turned up so doun, and ypocritis ben maad rehetours, so þat unneþe is left ony service of Cristis Chirche. And so bi þe service of men ben þei chaungid into oþer kynde, siþ þei ben Anticristis mynystris, and serven in anoþer Chirche.

Þe first maner þat God biddiþ is to be joyful and glade, and herfore bigynneþ Poul, and seiþ þus to Cristene men; <HI REND="italic">Joie</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">e in þe Lord evere more;</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">it Y seie, joie</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">e.</HI> And wiþoute þis maner of lyf Cristen man failiþ alȝatis in bileve, in hope, and charite. Þe ground of joie þat man shulde have shulde stonde clenly in his God, and þis joie shulde evermore be here in parte, and in hevene fulli. For what man may have þes þree, bileve, hope, and charite, but ȝif he þenke on Goddis goodnesse, and bi þis have joie þerof? And þus he failiþ in bileve þat wantiþ þis joie in God. And who hopiþ to come to blisse, þat feiþ telliþ is in heven, but ȝif he joie in þis hope þat he haþ of þis blis? Or who loveþ God bi charite, but ȝif he joie in Goddis heynesse? And siþ ech man shulde have þes þre, oþir in rote or in fruyte, ech man shulde ever joie in God þat is Lord of alle. And ȝif þis þouȝt, or þis joie, sleepe in man for a while, ȝit it shulde ever be, and quykene his spiritis to Godward. For noþing shulde quenche þis joie, but tribulacioun of man; but where is þanne hope of reward, in him þat þerfore joieþ not? A worldli man haþ myche joie of hope of his victorie, of wynnyng of worldly goodis, or fleishly lustis þat he coveitiþ; and siþ men shulden have more hope to have evermore blisse in hevene, how shulde not a man have joie in stablenesse of þis hope? Certis, defaute of hevenli hope makiþ þis joie in man to faile. Lord, how traveilen men in werre gladly for hope of victory; how traveilen men in mar∣chandize for jo[i]eful hope of worldly wynnynge; and how joiefulli traveilen men þat ben ledde here in fleishli love! And siþ þis hope shulde be more in blisse þat man shulde have, what man shulde not ay have joie, and þis joie shulde be in God?
<PB N="233" REF="252"/>
Of þis joie shulde come anoþer þat man shulde have in disservynge of þis joie; as we mai se bi ferþer ensaumplis, how wilfulli and joifulli man traveiliþ for a worldli cause, as ben worldli victory, worldli richessis, or fleishli lust. And certis þis is a veyn cause,—short, and bryngiþ no man to reste. And for þis joie of traveile for blisse, Poul biddiþ us ȝit have joie.</P>
<P>Þe secounde maner þat man shulde have, <HI REND="italic">is sadde maner and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">especially when they suffer for God,</NOTE> <HI REND="italic">knowun to men;</HI> and to move men to þis maner, Poul seiþ <HI REND="italic">þat þe Lord is ny</HI>ȝ. Poul moveþ not here to joie, as joien unstable men in gegilotis, but to sadde joiyng in God, and suffre for him wiþ glade chere; so þat it falliþ not to men to wepe for suffring for God, but þat alle maner men myȝten knowe how his knyȝtis suffren gladly for him. And þus seiþ Matheu, by Ysaie, þat þe Holy Goost seiþ of Crist, þat he shulde not stryve ne crye, and no man in þe strete shal heere his vois. For in alle þe passioun þat Crist suffride, he failide not in sadde chere. He cryede not out for his peyne, and so suffriden hise after hym. And to move men to þis glade chere, Poul seiþ, þat þe Lord is nyȝe. Cristen men taken as bileve, þat Crist is Lord and spouse of þe Chirche; and þat tyme til þe day of dome is nyȝe to regard. But wel we witen þat a wyf, whanne she shal soone mete wiþ hir housebonde, she gladiþ her herte and hir chere, in hope to be confortid of him. Whi shulden not Cristen soulis do so, whan þei hopen þer Spouse is nyȝe?</P>

And alȝif Poul, þat was ravishid, seiþ þat þis joie is hid, so þat neiþer iȝe haþ seyn it, ne eere haþ herd it, ne it haþ styed up into herte of man in erþe,—ȝit by glymer∣yng of Goddis grace may men knowe þis joie afer. Austin seþ, þat he is blessed þat haþ al þing þat he wole, and he wole noon yvel þing <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">S. Aug. De Trinitate, lib. xiii. §8.

For ellis men weren not fulli medid, þat sugetten here þer willis to Goddis, but ȝif he ȝaf hem al þer wille and ledde þer resoun aftir his; for ellis þis wanting were harmful, and man were not fulli blissid.</P>
<P>And þus men seien þat two blessis ben,—blesse of þe soule <NOTE PLACE="marg">The corporeal bliss of the saints.</NOTE> and blisse of þe bodi. And of bodili blisse is first for to speke, as blaborers may take here. It is seid comounly, how Crist haþ dowid his spousis body wiþ foure doweris of þe bodi, and þerinne stondiþ myche joie. Þe first dower is sutilte; þe secounde is agilite; þe þridde dowere is clerete; and þe fourþe immortalite. Seintis bodies ben so sotil and so shapen in þer partis, þat þei mai perse oþer bodies wiþouten lettyng of þer wille. And þus cam Crist out of his modir, and entride efte to his apostlis, alȝif þe ȝatis weren shitt, for noþing stood þanne aȝens his wille. Þe second dower of þe body is agilite, or swiftnesse; so þat as soone as þe blessid soule wolde be ony where in a place, as soone it moveþ þe bodi þidir, bi ablete of þe bodi. And þe first dower of þe bodi helpiþ to bryng in þis
<PB N="235" REF="254"/>
dower,—and ellis holy men in blisse hadden not al þing þat þei wolden, but sumtyme þei myȝten ellis be taried, and so mourne, for þing þat hem wantid. Þe þridde dower is clerete, þat mote nedis be medlid wiþ liȝt, so þat seintis shynen in heven as clere as þei wolen coveite; and no man þat is þere in blis desiriþ more clerete of his bodi. And þus was Crist clarified wiþ witnesse of boþe his lawes; and þus seiþ Crist in þe gospel, þat just men shulen shyne as þe sunne in þe rewme of þer fadir.

<P>First we taken of bileve, þat siþ oure first eldris hadden synned, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The necessity for an atone∣ment,</NOTE> þer muste aseeþ be maad þerfore bi þe riȝtwisnesse of God; for as God is merciful, so he is ful of riȝtwisnesse. But how shulde he juge al þe world, but ȝif he kepe here riȝtwisnesse? For þe Lord aȝens whom þis synne was done is God almyȝty and al-riȝtful, siþ no synne may be done, but ȝif it be done aȝens God.

<P>Þe þridde word, þat nedis mut sue of þes two wordis of lore, <NOTE PLACE="marg">the fact of which is cele∣brated on this day.</NOTE> is þat a child is born to man, to make aseþ for mannis synne.

Þe þridde lawe, of þe fend, is to do yvel for good; as God seide ȝhe, and Eve doutide; but þe fend seide opynly nay. Poul forfendiþ here þe myddil lawe, þat men shulden ȝelde yvel for yvel; and þus queyntise to a man is here dispreisid of Poul. For þat worldly man is queynt, boþe in werres and oþer lyfe, þat can ȝelde redely an yvel turne for anoþer.

And as anentis serpentis and oþer þingis þat bringiþ in peyne, þis bringing in of mannis peyne þat bi his foly makiþ þis peyne, is noon yvel of injury, but riȝtwisnesse þat God makiþ.

Ȝif he sue his patron as he feyneþ he sueþ Crist, he sueþ more þe emperour þan eiþer Crist or Seint Petre; for þe world is his patroun, and þe fadir of pryde also.

Þis man fediþ not Cristis sheepe, as Crist bade þries Petre, but spuyliþ hem, and sleeþ hem, and lediþ hem in many wrong weyes. ȝif he lovede Cristis sheepe, he shulde lede hem bi Cristis lawe, and watere hem, and make hem rest bi þe lesewes, and bi þes watris þat Crist haþ ordeyned for his sheep.

And þus spekiþ Lukes gospel by Zakary þe holy prophete, þat oure God haþ entrailis of mercy, bi which he visitid his puple.

Þe fourþe con∣dicioun <NOTE PLACE="marg">4. and of per∣verseness.</NOTE> of þis love is, þat it <HI REND="italic">doiþ not amys;</HI> for what þing þat he doiþ, his last entent is to do Goddis wille, and so to profit of his Chirche aftir þe lawe þat he haþ ȝovun. And þus al þes foure sectis semen to faile in charite, for þei leven Goddis lawe and worchen by þer feyned fyndingis; and so þei leven Goddis worship, and traveilen moost for þer owne wynnyng.

þus al þes foure sectis semen to faile in þis point, for þei coveiten þat mannis wille go forþ, and Goddis wille be put abac.

But how failiþ he not here, þat lettiþ þus Cristis or∣denance, and doiþ harm to many men, boþe to þer bodi and to þer soule?

And so þis shewiþ here more specialy þan kynde of mekenesse, for it shewiþ alle mekenesse of men, wiþ ground þat was in Crist. And so put þou away fals mekenes, as is in ypocritis, and con∣streyned mekenes, as is in þeves and prisoneris, and take þe vertu of mekenesse þat haþ ground in Jesus Crist.

a þing is whit. And so, siþ godhede may not falle to a þing bifore in kynde, þis godhede mut nedis be God, and so o per∣sone, þat haþ þis forme. And þus Poul seiþ in a manere, þat Jesus is verre God.

<P>PETRE telliþ in þis epistle of þe passioun of Crist, how myche <NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Peter on the passion of Christ.</NOTE> it was in himsilf, and ȝovun to ensaumple of Cristene men. <HI REND="italic">Crist,</HI> he seiþ, <HI REND="italic">haþ suffrid for us, levynge ensaumple to</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">ou þat</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">e folewe þe steppis of him.</HI> And so his passioun doiþ good to men þat weren, and men þat ben, and to men þat shulen come aftir. But men moten dispose hem to take profit of his pas∣sioun, as men þat weren bifore þis passioun token þis profit bi þer bileve, and men þat weren wiþ þis passioun, as weren Petre and oþire apostlis, addiden to feiþ love and sorowe. And þes men meneþ Petre here whan he seiþ, Crist suffride for us. Þe þridde men þat camen aftir, ben þo þat trowun þat Crist suffride, and adden love to þis bileve, and suen for Cristis sake his steppis. It is ofte seid in Goddis lawe þat ȝif a man wole come to hevene, he mut nedis sue Crist in feiþ, hope, and charite. And þerfore haþ God ordeyned to men, þat noon mai be excusid here; for ech man mai suffre for God, as ech man mai trowe and love. What man is so feble of power þat he ne mut nedis suffre deþ? And so þis suffryng shulde be sette in charite for Goddis sake. And ech man haþ a spirit, wiþ wille and undirstonding þerinne; and so God ȝyveþ ech man power to come to blis of heven; for God chargiþ nevere man to do more þan he mai do. For þis large Lord axiþ of man to be served of his owen; but pride lettiþ man to suffre, and moveþ him to fiȝt and stryve; and þerfore suffriþ <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI REND="italic">suffride,</HI> E.</NOTE> Crist contrariousely to þis doyng. For man doiþ as Adam dide by pride and in∣obedience; but Crist suffriþ bi mekenesse and obedience to God. And here mai men see now how þe fadir of pride moveþ hem to leve þis meke pacience, and to sue Crist in þis point;
<PB N="293" REF="312"/>
but he moveþ to do proudly aȝens Goddis wille, as Adam dide. And þus it is now to drede þat men þat suen not here Cristis steppis, maken þat Crist suffride not for hem. For þei taken not of Cristis merit, siþ a man mut dispose himsilf to have wilfulli part þerof. But no man mai suffre even wiþ Crist, and þerfore biddiþ Petre sue his steppis.</P>
<P>Þe gretnesse of Cristis suffryng is tauȝt bi Petre on þis <NOTE PLACE="marg">Whose suffer∣ing was more fruitful because of His sinless∣ness,</NOTE> maner. <HI REND="italic">Crist,</HI> he seiþ, <HI REND="italic">dide no synne, ne gile was foundun in his mouþ.</HI> And so his suffryng was more medeful, siþ he suffride not for his owne synne; as þevys whan þat þei ben hongid, or oþir traitours whan þat þei ben killid, suffren not so medefulli as men þat serveden not þis deþ. Crist was wiþ∣outen synne, and so not gilty to suffre peyne, but of his grace and his wille to bigge men þat weren coupable. Petre declariþ more þis suffryng, bi þat þat Crist was so meke, <HI REND="italic">þat whan he was cursid</HI> of þe Jewis, <HI REND="italic">he curside not a</HI>ȝ<HI REND="italic">en,</HI> but suffride mekeli þer yvel wordis. <HI REND="italic">And Crist</HI> whan he <HI REND="italic">suffride</HI> in dede, <HI REND="italic">he manasside not</HI> aȝen, but suffride mekeli his passioun; and bi þis cause myche more þat he myȝt, ȝif he hadde wolde, have take greet veniaunce of hem.</P>
<P>Petir telliþ aftir of þe wilful peyne þat Crist suffride for man∣kynde, <NOTE PLACE="marg">and was fore∣seen and volun∣tarily borne;</NOTE> by þat þat, <HI REND="italic">Crist offride himsilf</HI> to Pilat, <HI REND="italic">þat jugide him unri</HI>ȝ<HI REND="italic">tfulli.</HI> For Mathew telliþ how Crist bifore told al his passioun, and how he cam to Jerusalem to suffre fulli as he suffride. And so his suffrynge was medeful, for it was so myche wilful; for no man hadde more desire to die þus þan Crist hadde; ne Adam hadde no more desire to synne, þan Crist hadde to suffre. And þus he spekiþ in þe gospel, bi his godhede and his manhede, Bi desire have Y desirid to ete þus þis Paske wiþ ȝou. For etyng of þe Paske lombe, and sleyng þat was bifore of it, was figure to þis lombe of God; and þus it came of greet desire, and Adam myȝt not wille to synne bi so gret desire of lust. And Petre telliþ more of þis passioun, þat <HI REND="italic">Crist</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">af himsilf to þe man þat jugide him unjustli;</HI> þe which Crist, for we myȝte not, <HI REND="italic">bare oure synnes in his bodi, and he bare hem upon þe tree,</HI> as Adam synnede in a tree; <HI REND="italic">so</HI> þ<HI REND="italic">at we be deed fro synne, and lyve after to ri</HI>ȝ<HI REND="italic">twisnesse.</HI> Petir spekiþ here bi comoun speche, þat þat man beriþ a þing þat beriþ þe

<P>JAMES techiþ in þis epistle how þe religioun of Crist shulde <NOTE PLACE="marg">We are to be doers of the word, and not,—like the new orders,—hearers only.</NOTE> be clene kept of men, wiþouten ordre of mannis fynding; and he bigynneþ on þis maner. <HI REND="italic">Be</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">e doeris</HI> of Goddis <HI REND="italic">word, and not oonli herers, for þanne</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">e disseyve</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">ou silf,</HI> by medlyng of mannis ordre. For alle þes foure newe ordres moten be lernynge of al þer liif, of þe reule þat þei have founden, biside þe reule þat Crist ȝaf; and bi þer reulis þei ben tied, as a bole bi a staake, to dwelle at hoom in cloistre, or to love yvel þer owen ordre. Aȝens þis spekiþ James here, wiþ oþir auctours of holy writt. And Poul seiþ to Tymothe of þes vein newe ordris, þat þei ben evermore lernynge, and nevere comynge to fruyte þerof. It is knowun bi Goddis lawe þat heering of Goddis word is shapen of God for þis ende, to teche it and do it in dede. So, ȝif a man hadde ful knowyng of þis word, as Crist hadde, it were but foly and vein to heere and lerne more of þis word; as, ȝif a lond wolde bere good corn wiþouten tilyng and dongynge þerof, it were but ydil to traveile þerfore whan it encresiþ not þe fruyt. And herfore seiþ James here, þat þes men disseyven hem silf, as done many traveilers in scole.</P>

Þe first of þes þree siȝtis is moost clere, and moost certeyn. We shulen wite over þis, for James wordis, þat þis man þat ever lerneþ, and doiþ not in dede Goddis word, stondiþ ever more in þe meene, and never comeþ to þe fruyt þerof. And þus he fariþ as a man þat myȝt wel betir se a þing wiþouten mirour þan wiþ meroure, and ȝit he takiþ in vein a merour; and þus he falliþ in many errours of place and quantite of þat þing. And þus þes men þat evere lernen, and leven to do aftir þis lore, ben as lokers in a merour of visage þat þei hadden in ȝongþe. For þis lore of Goddis word shulde be a newe lore and unperfit siȝt, for þe ende in dede shulde come after, þat shulde be even as þe first siȝt. And þus þis man þat lokiþ him þus þouȝte on his soule for a tyme, but wente forþ bi curiouste, and forȝate soone to worche þerfore. Þus done men þat stonden in science, and worche not after bi þis science. And þes ben men of veyn religioun, as James techiþ opynli. For wirche we here in good liif, as ende of lore of Goddis word, and þan we shulen se in heven myche betir us silf and al oþir þingis on þe þridde maner of siȝt, wiþ curiouste þat liþ þerinne. For we shulen se in Goddis word al þe þingis þat God haþ maad, in a more clere kynde þan is þe kynde þat þei have wiþouten.

Þe apostlis weren tauȝt of þe Holy Goost for to wandre in þe world, and teche men boþe bi word and dede; for lore is best to men, and not to gedere in wete lumpes, as done oure newe ordres now.

That sermon is on the gospel for the first Sunday after Easter; this present sermon is on the epistle of a Sunday only five weeks later. The two passages taken together go far to prove that Wyclif wrote the gospel and epistle sermons simultaneously. For in both places the publication of the indulgence is spoken of as a recent event, which could not have been the case had the epistle sermon been composed in a different year from the gospel sermon. The pope in question must have been Clement the antipope, to whose cause the king of France adhered. Froissart mentions the issue of political indul∣gences of this kind by Clement, but without going into details; nor have I been able to find in any writer an explicit mention of this particular indulgence.</NOTE>.

<P>JOON telliþ in þis epistle how men shulden lyve þat suen <NOTE PLACE="marg">The life of Christians and the life of the world</NOTE> Crist, and algatis how þei shulden kepe bisili charite. Þer ben two lyves here; oon of verre Cristene men, anoþer is of worldly men, whiche Joon clepiþ here þe world. Þe first sect holdiþ Cristis lawe wiþouten contrariyng bi oþer lawe, and in þis ben many degrees, as preestis, lordis, and laborers. Worldly men ben siche men þat þe world haþ overcomen, and boþe in lawes and in customes þei ben reulid bi þe world; as þes two sectis ben myche medlid wiþ fals feynyng of ypocritis. For men þat ben not Cristen men ben medlid now wiþ Cristene men, and þei have lerned of þer lawes, of þer werkes, and of þer customes, and þe fend haþ tauȝt hem for to þenken þat þes ben beter þan lif after Cristis lawe, to make algatis hevene mennis eende.</P>
<P>Joon spekiþ to þe first sect, and biddiþ hem; <HI REND="italic">Wole</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">e not</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">distinguished, the one by love, the other by hatred.</NOTE> <HI REND="italic">woundre</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">if þe world hate</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">ou,</HI> as Crist biddiþ ofte tymes.

And now, whan þes newe ordris ȝyven hem þus to þe worlde, þei haten men speciali þat speken Goddis lawe aȝens hem. And woundre ȝe not herof, for þus hatiden scribis and Fariseis Crist.

Þe first sect haþ þe Holy Goost þat techiþ it, and makiþ it lyve; þe secounde sect is goostli deed, for it wantiþ quykenyng of þis spirit. Þe toþer diversite is þis; þat men of þe first sect kepen hem in charite, þe toþir sect hatiþ þis. And herfore seiþ Joon þus, We witen þat
<PB N="318" REF="337"/>
we ben translatid fro deþ to lyf, for we loven briþeren. Eche man undir Crist, boþe Cristene men and heþene, lyveden sum tyme worldly lyf til Crist hadde goostli baptisid hem. And herfore seiþ Joon soþli here, We witen þat we ben translated. And þis translacioun is beter þan worldly translacioun of þe pope, for it mai falle ofte tymes þat men þat he translatiþ þus ben more deep in goostli deeþ þan þei weren bifore þis. For spiritis of men þat ben dampned han more peyne bi þe synne þat þei bygunnen to grounde here, þan þei hadden bifore þis synne. As, ȝif a dampned man was riche, and castide togidir myche good, and ordeynede whan he diede to gete him worldli glorie bi þis, þat spirit is more punishid aftir þat þis error growiþ. And þus seiþ Bernard of sum heretikes, þat men knowen not now þer peyne, for þei witen not how many men ben pervertid bi þer lore. And hereon shulden þes sectis þenke, and stonde in lore of Jesus Crist, for þer newe lore pervertiþ many, and makiþ hem more punishid in helle. For whanne a spirit comeþ to helle, þat synnede bi errour þat þei tauȝten, who drediþ not þat ne þei han peyne bi newe comynge of siche felowis? And þis moveþ many men to holden þe boundis of Cristis lore, siþ þis lore is ynowȝ and mai not erre, but oþir mai. But Crist forbediþ not, but biddiþ his disciplis in figure, þat þei gidere up þe relif þat is lefte of Cristis mete.</P>
<P>And to þis entent seiþ Joon, <HI REND="italic">He þat loveþ not dwelliþ in deþ.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The new sects, by refusing to follow Christ's law, show a spirit of hatred.</NOTE> And as it is seid in þe nexte <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">That is, as we should say, in the last.</NOTE> Sermon, of þis love ben many gabbingis.

And herfore ben sum men moved to leve þes foure newe sectis, for alle þe lawis þat þei have propre muten nedis faile aftir þis lyf. And þus it is of worldis lawe, þat techiþ here to parte goodis.</P>
<P>But Joon seiþ þat, <HI REND="italic">In þis we have knowen þe charite of God, þat he puttide his lyf for us, and we shulden for breþeren putte oure lyves.</HI> He puttiþ his lyf for his broþer, þat traveiliþ wiþ his kyndely goodis, boþe of bodi and of soule, for þe profite of his broþir. ȝif man, bi reulis of þe world, wastiþ his kyndely goodis, and doiþ harme to his neiȝboris soule, alȝif he seie þat he doiþ it for love, he loveþ not his broþir but hatiþ him.

<P>But, for charite is shewid bi ȝyvynge of bodili almes, bi <NOTE PLACE="marg">Love known by its fruits.</NOTE> which mannis bodi is susteyned, Joon techiþ, bi a lasse signe, how men failen in charite.

bi coloure of almes of ypocritis. But Joon seiþ here þree wordis þat shulden be chargid of Cristene men.

Þus men shulden seie to stronge beggers, Y have noon sich goodis to ȝeve þee, but Y have lore bi Goddis lawe þat þou shuldist not begge þus, and þat Y wole telle to þee.

Poul biddiþ at þe first þat Cristen men <HI REND="italic">coveite not yvel þingis,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">chosen people, warns the Corinthians to shun certain sins, as 1. covetous∣ness;</NOTE> bi yvel desires, for þis is rote of oþir synnes. For boþe Adam and Eve synneden bi þis coveitise, for bi þer unskilful desire þei coveitiden to ete of þe appil, and wenden þat it hadde be good for hem; but þei erriden in þis coveitise. Poul biddiþ aftirward þat a man shal not be made a worshiper of fals <NOTE PLACE="marg">2. idolatry;</NOTE> goddis bi siche wickide coveitise, as sum men in þe olde lawe made a calf þer god. And þus seiþ Poul aftir, þat sum men of þe olde lawe synneden fouli in þis synne, and þus in many oþer synnes. Þ<HI REND="italic">e puple sate to ete and drynke, and þei risen after to pleye;</HI> for wantonesse in siche wille, þat is misturned fro Goddis wille, bringiþ in oþir synnes, and makiþ man out of bileve. And þus al þes newe ordris coveiten bi wrong desire strange patrouns, or oþir þingis þat bringen hem in wrong bileve. And þus it semeþ þat many men of þes sectis ben heretikes, for þei worshipen falsly þingis aȝens Goddis wille; as Poul clepiþ averous men, þat loven to myche worldly goodis, servytours of mawmetis, and þis is open heresie. And þus may trewe men renne bi many synnes þat now ben usid.</P>
<P>Þe þridde tyme biddiþ Poul, <HI REND="italic">þat men shulden not do forni∣cacioun,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">3. fornication;</NOTE> neiþer bodili ne goostli, for God mut venge for þes boþe.

But Poul leveþ a þousand of þes, oþer for þis þousand weren saved, or for oþer cause þat we knowen not. But ay stondiþ þe treuþe of Goddis lawe in þe forme þat Poul telliþ it; for who so killiþ foure men, he mut nedis kille þree. Þe fourþe tyme biddiþ <NOTE PLACE="marg">4. tempting Christ; of which sin the four sects are grievously guilty;</NOTE> Poul, <HI REND="italic">þat we tempte not Crist, as sum of hem temptiden him, and þei perishiden bi eddris.</HI> And þes men tempten Crist þat loken as beestis to his cros, and wrappen hem silf in lustful liif, and suen him not in his peyne.

And þis tempting semeþ more grevous þan was þe toþir temptyng in figure. For þe children of Israel grutchiden for hem wantide water, but þes newe ordris, now aftir more kyndenes of Crist, hadden plente of wisdom þat Crist ȝaf hem for to drynke, but þei grutchiden aȝens þis water,
<PB N="335" REF="354"/>
and drunken podel water of þe canel. And resoun dampneþ more þis tempting þan þe toþir in desert.</P>
<P>Þe fyveþe tyme biddiþ Poul, <HI REND="italic">þat we grutche not a</HI>ȝ<HI REND="italic">ens God,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">5. murmuring against God.</NOTE> for worldli desire ne fleishli, ne for peyne þat we suffren; but be we paied of Goddis soude.

And as hem wantide þe bihiȝt ende to þe children of Israel, so þes grutchers muten wanten blis þat God haþ bihiȝt to his. And þus grutchen men to dai aȝens þe ordenaunce of Crist, and shapen hem a newe reule, as if þei leften Crist for a fool. And þus in þes fyve figuris many men licly suppose, þat moo perishen in tyme of grace bi þes fyve synnes þat rengnen now, þan diden in þe olde lawe of þe children of Israel.</P>
<P>And ȝit Poul seiþ here, <HI REND="italic">þat alle þes falliden in figure to hem,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">We, near the end of the world, whom the devil con∣sequently as∣sails more fiercely, have the advantage of a great store of examples.</NOTE> for to teche þe Chirche aftir to fle to synne as þei diden. And herfore seiþ Poul aftir, <HI REND="italic">þat þes ben writun to oure snybbyng, in to whom þe endis of þe worlde ben comen.</HI> It is knowun of bileve, þat nyȝ þe ende of þe worlde þe fend temptiþ man faster þan he dide in þe bigynnyng, for þe shrew is more envious, and drediþ him of þe day of dome. And þerfore God haþ sent a gracious remedie to oure helpe, þat we have a good lore of ensaumplis þat have bifallen, boþe in þe olde lawe and þe newe; and in þes shulden we studie, and leve fablis and newe reulis, for þei helpen not but to flee hem. And þus, ȝif we þenken wel of þe worldis þat weren bifore, how strong and faire men weren þan, and how þe fruytis weren þan good, and now is al turned up so doun, and ȝit we have helpe of Crist bi his lif and his lymes, we shulden herfore leve þis world, and desire more þe blis of heven.

And herefor seiþ Poul aftir, <HI REND="italic">And þerfore he þat gessiþ he stonde, se he warly þat he falle not.</HI> For boþe we ben now more feble, and enemyes tempten us more sutilli, and þerfore we shulden be more ware, and sue Crist more bisili.</P>

<PB N="336" REF="355"/>
þerfore Poul telliþ what tempting man shulde flee in al weies. Sum is tempting of man, and sum is tempting of þe fend. He is taken in mannis tempting, whos soule is temptid of ony enemy, and oþer he aȝen-stondiþ þis tempting, or ellis he risiþ soone of his synne. And þus was Crist taken in temptyng, for he hadde it boþe in bodi and in soule; and þan þis tempting toke him as a suget to þis tempting. But Poul biddiþ oþer aȝen-stonde it, or ellis soone arise fro falling. Þe fendis tempt∣ing is þanne, whan it is so hardid in man, þat it leveþ him never til þat he be brouȝt to helle. And so ech man þat is þus temptid is a fend, as ben þei þat he goiþ to. And man shulde trow bi bileve, þat non mai have þis fendis tempting, but ȝif his synne or his foli bryng him into þis tempting. And herfore seiþ Poul aftir,<HI REND="italic">—God is trewe, þat shal not suffre</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">ou be temptid over þat þat</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">e may, but he shal make wiþ</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">oure tempting a ferre comyng of grace,</HI> þat ȝe mai susteyne ȝour temptinge.

Lord! siþ Crist wolde not have as mouche as a litil hous to reste ynne is heed, as propre to him silf, how shulde Cristis viker be so greet lord in þis world? And siþ Crist was so acordinge wiþ lordship of þe empire, þat he chargide it nouȝt in begginge ne in almesse∣takinge, but tauȝte how it shulde stande, boþe in word and dede,—how is he Cristis viker þat reversiþ Crist in þis? For bi cautel of þe fend, he haþ getun him half þe empire, and alle þe rewmes in Cristendom feelen his pryvy spoilinge. Siþ Anti∣crist is þat like man þat contrarieþ Crist in lyvynge, as anentis poverte þis pope is Anticrist.</P>
<P>And, as anentis þe secounde point, it semeþ þat þis pope <NOTE PLACE="marg">and also the proudest,</NOTE> is moost proude in herte of alle men in erþe, for worldli lord∣ship and þis pride goen togidere. And þe pope, as he dar, chalengiþ to be cheef lord of ech rewme and lordship þat is here in erþe. But blessid be þe Lord of hevene, þat kepiþ moche in hondis of seculer lordis! And stinkinge pryde of þis pope haþ dividid many londis fro him. Þe secounde con∣dicioun to asaie mekenesse of herte, is þat a man be merciful, and not venge his owne injurie. But lete a man seye Goddis lawe, if it myslike to þis pope, he wole curse him as eretike, and aftir sle him if he mai. And reising of his croiserie aȝens anoþer pope techiþ mouche þat he wolde venge þing þat he clepiþ his owne injurie. Þe þridde condicioun þat sueþ poverte of a mannis soule, is þat he be meke in speche, and hiȝe not his name here. But þis pope wole þat he be clepid þe moost blessid fadir, and þat noon oþer in erþe have name þat mai be evene to his name. For he seiþ þat his power is more wiþ∣outen mesure þan ony oþeris, as in graunting of indulgencis and oþir dedis þat he doiþ. But bileve of þe gospel techiþ þat Crist, in al þis, dide þe contrarie. For, as Crist seiþ himsilf, if he seke þus his owne glorie, his glorie is nouȝt but falshede

in ypocrisie. And so anentis þis mekenesse þis pope con∣trarieþ to Crist; and þus he semeþ to be Anticrist for þe secounde condicioun.</P>
<P>And as anentis þe þridde condicioun, þat is, profitinge to þe <NOTE PLACE="marg">and the most selfish and simoniacal.</NOTE> Chirche, siþ it shulde be goostli profitinge, groundid in vertues, noo drede sich an ypocrite doiþ moost harm to þe Chirche. And if he parte benefices, and ordeyne ouȝt bi his lawe, it smatchiþ aftir symonie and crokiþ fro Cristis lawe; and þis is no profiting, but harmyng to Cristis Chirche; for coveitise and pride mooven him to siche workis. But it is bidding of Crist to ȝyve freeli, as men token, and to do good pryvyli, for to quenche ypocrisie. And so, if þes þre condicions be wel examyned in Crist and Petir, and þe liif of þis pope be treuly examyned bi hem, he is an open Anticrist among alle þe sinful men in erþe.</P>
<P>And þus semeþ þat Crist meenede, whanne he spekiþ þese wordis;<HI REND="italic">—Whanne</HI> ȝ<HI REND="italic">e shulen se abhominacioun of disconfort, teld of Daniel þe profete, stonding in þe holi place; he þat rediþ undir∣stonde he.</HI> Sum men undirstonden þis word, þat Crist wolde <NOTE PLACE="marg">By the 'abomi∣nation of deso∣lation' some understand the present pope,</NOTE> telle to his disciplis þat þe dai of dome shulde not be bifore þat þis pope rengnede þus;—and whan men seen þis rengnyng, rede þei þis gospel and undirstonde it. First, he stondiþ in holi place; for he seiþ þat he is Cristis viker and Petris felowe, and passiþ myche oþer apostlis of Crist. For if a prest reprove him, as pore Poul reprovede Petir, he wolde not take it as dide Petir, but dampne þis preest to be brent. So þe state þat he stondiþ inne shulde be holi, if it were wel; and more abho∣minacioun was nevere, þan an ypocrite to stonde þus, and lyve þus contrariously to Crist, for he is worse þan oþir fendis. For, siþ þat Bernard seiþ wel <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI REND="italic">De Consideratione,</HI> lib. ii. cap. 7. 'Simia in tecto, rex fatuus in solio sedens.'</NOTE>, þat an unwise kyng in his rewme is an ape in þe roof of þe halle, for propirtees þat fallen to him, mouche more sich a pope, maad as heed of holi Chirche, is a fend in mannis bodi, and disturbliþ al þe Chirche. And siþ synne, among oþir þingis, is moost abhominable to God, and ypocrisie, among oþere synnes, is moost abhominable to treuþe, Crist clepiþ wiseli þis synne abbominacioun it silf. For synne, abhominable
<PB N="397" REF="416" MS="y"/>
to God, shulde be abhominable to men. And þis is a dis∣confort to þe goostli iȝen of trewe men; for if we þenken how þat Crist helpide his Chirche goostli, and put his liif for his Chirche, to bringe it to fredom, it were a greet disconfort to se a fend sitte in Cristis stede, and live and do contrariousli to þe dedis þat Crist dide. For as a good heed doiþ confort to þe meyne of þis heed, so a foul, abbominable heed doiþ dis∣confort to his meyne. And so it were more disconfort to han sich an heed in þe Chirche, þan to have an heed of a dragoun or an eddir.</P>

But it seems at least equally likely that Wyclif meant to refer to the public protestation, which he made in 1378 before the pope's delegates, of his willingness to retract any errors that he might be proved to have fallen into. See Lewis' <HI REND="italic">Life of Wyclif,</HI> p. 59.</NOTE>, we wolen mekeli amende þis, or aȝen-calle þis, if we ben tauȝt þat it is fals. But quyk resoun, or auctorite, shulde meeve men to Goddis witt. As many foolis arguen here þat if Crist hadde þis witt he wolde have said more opynli to profit of his Chirche,—but here we seien þat Crist spekiþ ofte, boþe in þe eelde lawe and in þe newe, derkli to many men, for þe profite of his Chirche. For, bi þe lore of Austin, Crist wole þat men have mede for to tra∣veile for Goddis lawe, and to seke þe witt þerof; and men can not disprove þat ne sich witt, hid for a tyme, profitiþ to Cristis Chirche, as dampnynge of men profitiþ. But ȝit Anticrist grutchiþ here, and seiþ, þis witt is not confermed bi holi doc∣tours of Goddis lawe; whi shulde it not be dispisid for defaute of good ground?

And here we axen of Anti∣crist, to what Crist spak þes wordis; and putte he his witt bi ouris, and disprove ouris if he can, and prove he his contrarie witt by resoun or autorite.

Þei graunten þat þe Chirche bineþe haþ an heed, þat is Crist, heed of aungelis and of men, alle þat weren, or shulen be saved; and we doren not putte two heedis, lest þe Chirche were monstrous. But wel we witen þat Crist wolde ordeyne ever more oon beter þan anoþir to wende to hevene bi his lawe, as he dide Petir for a tyme; and if he ordeyne many felowis to helpe Peter, as he dide Poul, so mouche more ben men holden to God. And þis reversiþ not his ordenaunce; for ech apostle hadde in his contre pleyn power, wiþ helpe of Crist, so þat noon hadde nede of Petir, to renne and be confermyd of him. And if ony seie þe reverse, lete him prove it bi autorite; for resoun failliþ in þis mater, to prove þis þng þat men dremen. And so Petir was not heed of þe Chirche, but a capteyn of þe Chirche. And certis werriouris wolen scorne þis resoun, þat if a man be capteyn, he is heed. Petir was capteyn for a tyme, and aftir him was Poul capteyn; and þer was noo striif in þis, which of hem shulde be capteyn; for hem fel noo worldli wynnyng, but more traveil axiþ more blis. And so, if men wolen not be apis, but speke bi ful similitude, þei moten maken pore staat of þe Chirche, as it was in Petris tyme, and in þat forme þat Crist chees Petir, chees an able man as was Petir. But al þe world wole skorne þis skile, þat if Crist, boþe God and man, chees Petir bi pure Goddis lawe, þanne þe cardinalis aftir shulden cheese a feend bi pure mannis lawe.

For as it is folie to chese þe worse, so it is folie to chese þe uncerteyn. Þese cheseris wolen be even wiþ Crist; þerfore her folie doiþ hem harm.

And siþ þer ben fewe wise men, and foolis ben wiþouten noumbre, assent of more part of men makiþ evydence þat it were foli.

Lord, wheþir ech pope aftirward passiþ here Crist wiþoute mesure! Poul seiþ, þat Anticrist hiȝeþ him moche above Crist; but wel we witen þat þis boost is fals, and comeþ of þe fend. For þe pope woot not þe perilis þat comen to his owne persone; how shulde he knowe þe persones able þat he siȝ nevere in fer contres? and siþ Crist and Petre diden not þus, whi shulde þe pope presume þis? his owne synne were ynowȝ, if he took no more on him. But coveitise semeþ þe cause, and not merit to alarge his blis. And siþ Petir hadde Poul to felowe, and oþir apostlis, wiþ Clement, whi shulde not þis pope have felowis and helps, as God haþ?

And þanne he passiþ Jesus Crist, þat wente ofte, and not in veyn, to be present in many places, aftir þat his man∣heed axide. Alle þes shewen þat coveitise moveþ þe pope to do þus, for he wolde not have a felowe, and take part of his wyn∣nyng; and so pride and coveitise blynden þe pope in his liif.

Sich biddingis in prelatis shewen pride of Anticrist; for wherbi shulde þis man wite þat he haþ power to bidde þis? Petir, and oþir seintis, hadden revelacioun of God, þat Crist wolde þat it were so, as opin miraclis shewiden to men; but doumbenesse of þes signes telliþ us þat þes wordis ben fals, and croking fro Cristis liif unto þe world techiþ men þat þese wordis ben feyned, for pride and for coveitise.

For it were opin heresie to trowe þat Crist acceptiþ so persones, and lefte þe goodnesse of his preiour for novelrie of mannis preyour.

Þe Glose <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It would seem that a want had been felt in the party of which Wyclif was the head, of a good Commentary in English on the New Testament.

This 'glose,' it would seem, judging from the manner in which it is re∣ferred to in the text, had become a work of established reputation.

And Crist wolde teche, as nede were, chaunging of oure serimonies; for, as God telde Adam and Joseph, bi litil and litil, what þei shulden do, so Crist wolde telle men of his ordre how þei shulden worche and serve him. For men shulden ever þenke on God, for Crist mai not faile to hem; and þus men seien þat Bartholemew knelide an hun∣drid tymes on þe nyȝt and an hundrid tymes on þe dai, and bad hise bedis to Jesus Crist. Wheþir Bartilmew seide þanne his Pater Noster, or what preieris, reden we not, but we trowen not þat he seide his matynes, ne kepte ever more þis liif. And oþir apostlis varieden wel, aftir þat Crist tauȝte hem; and I am certeyn þat Crist wole ȝit, if men serven him as þei shulden.

As Lyndwood (quoted in Gibson's <HI REND="italic">Codex),</HI> writing about 1440, declares that in his time the Sarum use was followed through almost the whole of the province of Canterbury, it seems possible that when Wyclif speaks of each cathedral having a different use, he refers to differences of chant∣ing only, not to such more import∣ant differences, in the wording and arrangement of the prayers, &amp;c., as properly constitute a distinct use. Or, again, by a 'cathedral' he may have meant a metropolitan church, assuming the Sarum use to be that of the southern, and the York use to be that of the northern, metro∣politan province.</P>
<P>Professor Stubbs suggests that Wyclif may be merely referring to local peculiarities of service, in honour of local saints, as of St. Hugh at Lincoln, St. Wilfrid at Ripon, or St. Ethelbert and St. Thomas at Herford.</P></NOTE>, so Crist wolde teche ech Cristene man how he shulde preye and serve him, but if his synne were in cause. And þus sich lymytinge of cloþis, of fasting, and of preiyng, doiþ harm to Cristis Chirche, for it distrieþ Cristis fredom, and bostiþ of nede of þe pope, and puttiþ men out of bileve. For if þis were nedeful to Cristis ordre, þer shulde not þus be many ordres; siþ alle freris monkes and chanouns han oon ground in holi writt; and so alle preestis in þe world shulde holde þe use of þe Court of Rome. And ȝif þou seie þat special patrouns oblishen men to siche þingis, teche where þei hadden witt or power to oblishen men on þis maner. Wel I woot þat boost is feyned, and moneye ȝovun for to dispence and assoile men of synnes, þat ben entrikid wiþ sich ritis. And so þis, wiþ oþir dedis, smatchiþ coveitise of þe pope.</P>

Ne Goddis bodi is þe beste þing þat is in place of þis oost, for þere is þe Trinite, þat is betere þan Goddis bodi; and Cristene men axen not what is þere, but what is þat as Crist spekiþ.

But certis, among oþir goodis þat þe popis lawe doiþ to men, it makiþ hem perplex, and bindiþ her conscience wiþ feyned bondis. For as fendis in apostlis tyme feyneden mouche helpe in greet templis, whanne þei ceessiden to punishe men þe which þei bonden bifore, so feyneþ Anticrist to do privylegiis to men, whanne he releesiþ his owne bondis, þat weren put to harme oþir men. And so alle þes privylegiis ben cacling of malice þat is mystaken aȝens God and his Chirche, and so þei ben not prevylegiis, but ceessinge of malice þat God suffriþ. And þus it is of alle privylegiis of bishopis and of abbotis, þat þei singen wiþ myters or crosis glitirynge wiþ gold; for in suche privy∣legies þe fend ȝyveþ power to do more aȝens Crist and aȝens his symple peple, and robbiþ hem more gredili of goodis þat þei shulden lyve bi. And so alle sich privylegiis tellen two pridis and two coveitises; o pride of þe pope, and anoþir pride of þe prelat, for he wolde passe oþir for pride of þis liif. And two coveitisis ben medelid here togidere; oon is in þe pope, þat whanne a prelat dieþ þe pope wole have his stente of alle þat falliþ to his hous. And bi þis privylegii þis prelat boostiþ above oþir prelatis, and seiþ þat he is more worþi, for þe pope haþ þus lokid to him; not lokid to his mekenesse, but to his Luciferis pride. And so alle dedis of þe pope, and prelatis þat ben under him, sownen to pride and coveitise and not to meke∣nesse and povert of Crist. And so þes fyve pointis of þe pope

And Crist biddiþ here Cristene men not trowe if þat oo pope be closid in castel, and þat oþir walke in wildirnesse; for neþer of þes is groundid in God. And siþ men tellen þes wordis bineþe bileve to wite þe soþe, he is unskilful þat dampneþ men for desir to knowe þis gospel, for wel wete we þat it is soþ, and haþ good witt who so knewe it; and we wolde fayn knowe þe riȝt witt, and leeve þis witt if it were fals.
