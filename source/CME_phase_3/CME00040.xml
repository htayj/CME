In whiche wordes the holy goste sayth thre thinges that longe to the prays∣ynge of oure mooste blessed Lady. ¶ Fyrste who they be that prayse hyr, whan he sayeth, the doughters of Syon. ¶ The seconde what they doo or they begynne to prayse hyr, whan he sayeth that they haue sene hyr. ¶ The thyrde, the maner of hyr praysynge, whan he sayeth, &amp; they haue shewed hyr mooste blessed, ther∣fore he sayeth.

But though all chrysten soulles that treuly lyue in chrysten fayth, may be called doughtres of Syon, that is to say of holy chyrche: yet more properly ye ar called <NOTE PLACE="marg">The nuns of Syon monastery are especially daughters of the spiritual Syon.</NOTE> doughters of Syon. For not onely ye ar doughtres of holy chyrche by chrysten byleue as other chrysten people ys: But also ye are doughtres of this holy relygion, which as a mother noryssheth youre soulles in grace in this Monastery that ys named Syon. And
<PB N="2" REF="70"/>
therfore as ye are doughtres of this bodely Syon, so ought ye to be doughtres of Syon <MILESTONE UNIT="leaf" N="A .ij"/> gostly. For Syon ys as moche to say as a com<HI REND="italic">m</HI>aundement or byholdinge. And ye ought to be doughtres of com<HI REND="italic">m</HI>aundement by meke <NOTE PLACE="marg">By obedience to God, their Rule, and their Sovereign;</NOTE> &amp; redy obedyence to the byddynges of god, and of youre reule, and of youre soueraynes, ye ought also to be doughtres of byholdynge by co<HI REND="italic">n</HI>templacyon &amp; specyally in byholdyne of youre owne wretchednes, and of youre vnkyndenes agenste god, and of the charite and goodnes that he dothe to you. ye oughte to beholde also the shortnes and vnstablenes of thys lyfe, the hastynes of dethe, the ferefulnes of dome, the bytter∣nes <NOTE PLACE="marg">by contemplation, love, and fear.</NOTE> of paynes, and the swyete and ioyfull rewardes of blysse. And if ye be thus good doughtres of Syon by meke obedyence and by trew beholdynge of these thynges: then ar ye well dysposed the more worthyly to prayse oure moste gloryous lady. ¶ The seconde thynge that the holy goste tellyth in these wordes (ys) what ye ought to doo or ye begynne to prayse oure lady. And that ys that ye oughte to se her. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Seeing our Lady by inward under∣standing.</NOTE> For ye wote well that no man ne may well shewe the worthynes or the propertyes of any thynge to the praysynge therof: but yf he haue fyrste som syght &amp; knowlege of the same thynge by one meane or other. How shall ye then condewly shewe by outwarde praysyng the excellent hyghnes and worthynes of the moste blyssed heuenly quene, oure reuerente lady, as yt is full fayre expressed in al youre holy seruyce: but yf ye haue fyrste syght therof by inwarde vnderstandinge. ¶ But forasmoche as many of you, though ye can <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mirror written to help this understand∣ing by translation of their Service into English.</NOTE> synge and rede, yet ye can not se what the meanynge therof ys: therefore to the onely worshyp and praysyng of oure lorde Iesu chryste and of hys moste mercyfull mother oure lady <MILESTONE UNIT="leaf" N="A iij."/> and to the gostly co<HI REND="italic">m</HI>forte and profyte of youre soules I haue drawen youre legende and all youre seruyce in to Englyshe, that ye shulde se by the

vndersto<HI REND="italic">n</HI>dyng therof, how worthy and holy praysynge of oure gloryous Lady is contente therin, &amp; the more deuoutely and knowyngly synge yt &amp; rede yt and say yt to her worshyp. ¶ And in many places where the <NOTE PLACE="marg">And, where necessary for simple souls, by exposition of its meaning.</NOTE> nakyd letter is thoughe yt be set in englyshe, ys not easy for some symple soulles to vnderstonde; I ex∣pounde yt and declare yt more openly, other before the letter, or after or else fourthewyth togyther. ¶ And farthermore, that ye shulde haue the more sprytuall loue, &amp; inwarde delyte and deuocyon, in thys holy seruyce I tell the causes &amp; the meanynges of eche parte therof, that is to say, whan I come to the fyrste <NOTE PLACE="marg">The various parts of Divine Service are also ex∣plained.</NOTE> Inuitatory; I tell what an Inuitatory ys to say, and why yt ys namyd so &amp; set in suche a place. And so I do of Psalmes and Hympnes, and Antempnes, and re∣spo<HI REND="italic">n</HI>ces and versicles, and all suche other. For I de∣clare why they ar callyd so, that ys to say, why an hympne ys callyd an hympne, and why an Antempne is callyd an Antempne and so fourth of other, and why they ar set &amp; sayde in suche wyse, as ye may se more playnely in the story of the Sonday, eche thynge in hys place. ¶ Of psalmes I haue drawen but fewe, for ye <NOTE PLACE="marg">But few psalms are translated, for they may be found in Ham∣pole's version, and in English Bibles.</NOTE> may haue them of Rycharde hampoules drawynge, and out of Englysshe bibles if ye haue lysence therto. ¶ Also when I drawe a thynge ones in to englysshe, I write it not agayne as often as I fynde it after in eche place, but onely in the fyrste place, as <HI REND="italic">Gloria patri,</HI> is declaryd in the begynnyng of matyns on Sonday, and <HI REND="italic">Maria mater,</HI> and <HI REND="italic">Gloria tibi domine,</HI> in the ende <MILESTONE UNIT="leaf" N="A .iij."/> of the fyrste Hympne the same daye. And then I speke no more therof in all your seruice after, as ofte as yt is sayde. And the same I doo of all suche other for the moste parte. ¶ ye shall also vnderstonde <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mirror in three parts:</NOTE> that thys boke ys deuyded in to thre partyes.

Oure ladyes myroure.

And so the Ioye that the same blessed Trinyte had of the same glorious Lady, endelesly or she was made as ye rede on Sonday: was fulfylled in her effectually in dede, in her assumpcyon, as ye rede on Saterday. ¶ And thus from Sonday tyll Saterday, dayly, wekely, and yerely; ye ar occupyed w<HI REND="italic">ith</HI> youre tongues in oure Ladyes seruyce, wherfore ye ought to take hede, that youre myndes be as besy and co<HI REND="italic">n</HI>tynually occupyed aboute the same thinges by inwarde vnder∣stondynge

For, openly ye oughte to prayse her and dystynctely, that other folke may vnderstonde youre praysyng to theyr edyfycacyon, &amp; therfore he sayeth <MILESTONE UNIT="leaf" N="A 5"/> they haue shewyd.

And yf he gyue them not to owre felyng he gyueth them to our most profyt, yf the defaulte be not in vs. And therefore we oughte to be right ware that we gyue none occasyon to oureselfe, ne to none other of lettynge of deuocion, by herynge or saynge worde or token or in eny other wyse.
