<P>"I was under the protexion of Mered ap Owein; he sende to me be trety of my cosynes Maester Edward and Edward ap David, and askyt ȝif I wold cum in, and he wold gete me the King's charter, and I schuld be Maester Forster, and Key∣shat in Chirke is lond; and other thinges he behiȝt me, the qwich he fulfullyt not.</P>
<P>"Afterward he askyt me qwether I would go over see with hym, and he wold gete me my charter of the Kynge, and bringe me to hym sounde and saff, and I schuld have wages as muche as any gentilman schuld have that went with hym. And over thys he seide befor the Byschop of Seint Assaph, and befor my forsaede cosynes, that, rather then I schuld fael, he wold spene of his own godde xx marke.</P>
<P>"Her apon I trust, and gete me ij men, and boȝt armery at all pees, and horses, and other araement, and come to Oswestre a nyȝt befor or thei went. And on the morw ther after I send Piers Cambr̄, the Rese∣vor of Chirke is lond, thryes to him, for to tel him that I was redy. He saed that I schuld speke no word with him; and at the last he saed that he hade no wages for me; and that he hade al his retenev; but bade me go to S<SUP>r</SUP> Ric. Lakin [MS.

And he that made the be ther to helpyng, and we on our behalfe shalle be welle willyng. For thy lettre is knowlechyng.</P>
<P>Written, etc. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>This remarkable letter is one of a series of three preserved in MS. Cotton. Cleop. F. III., two of which are printed in Sir Henry Ellis's "Original Letters" (2nd Series, i. 3-7).</P>
<P>It is there suggested, in a note at page 5, that this is the letter alluded to in that printed as No. I., in which Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin, writing to the Prince of Wales, says,—"the strengest thiefe of Wales sent me a lettre, which lettre I send to you." It is clear, however, that the letter here al∣luded to is that printed as No. II. in Ellis's collection, to which the letter in the text is an answer, being from Lord Grey de Ruthyn himself, and addressed to, not written by, Griffith ap David ap Griffith. The true order is, therefore, as follows:—</P>
<P N="1">I. From Griffith ap David ap Griffith to Lord Grey de Ruthyn, MS. Cotton. Cleopat. F. III. fol. 72; (Ellis, p. 5), June 11, 1400.</P>
<P N="2">II. Lord Grey's answer, printed above, and dated on or before the 23rd of June, 1400.</P>
<P N="3">III. Lord Grey's letter to the Prince of Wales (Ellis, p. 3), in∣forming him of the receipt of Letter I., and that he had written an an∣swer to it (Letter II.), of which he enclosed a copy. There can be little doubt that the MS. from which the text is printed, and which is pasted on the back of Lord Grey's letter to the Prince, is the "copy" here alluded to. The passage in full is as follows: "And, gracious Lorde, please hit you to witte that the day that the Kynges messager cam with the Kynges lettres, and with youres to me, the strengest thiefe of Wales sent me a lettre, which lettre I send to you, that ye mowe knowen his goode wyll and gouvernance, with a copie of an other letter that I have send to him agayn of an answare."</P></NOTE></P>
