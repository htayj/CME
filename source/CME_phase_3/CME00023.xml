<HEAD>THE DEDICACION OF THIS PRESENT WOORKE, VNTO THE RIGHT HONORABLE <HI REND="italic">LORDE THOMAS DUKE OF NORFFOLKE,</HI> BY THENPRYNTER, RICHARD GRAFTON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LOrde Thomas of Norffolke, duke moste gracious,</L>
<L>Of noble auncestrie and blood descended,</L>
<L>A captain right woorthie and auenturous,</L>
<L>And frō Scotlād euen newely retended,</L>
<L>Wher Englandes querele ye haue reuenged,</L>
<L>In the behalf of our noble kyng Henry,</L>
<L>I wyshe you all health, honour, and victorie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ And because it hath pleased almightie God,</L>
<L>In the right title and querele of Englande,</L>
<L>To vse your stocke<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Stroke, <HI REND="italic">edit. alt.</HI></NOTE> as an iron rod,</L>
<L>Wherewith to scourge the falsehood of Scotland,</L>
<L>In whom is no truthe ne holde of any bande;</L>
<L>Ihon Hardynges chronicle, as me thought, was</L>
<L>Moste mete to bee dedicated to your grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ For Hardyng, a true herted Englysheman,</L>
<L>An esquier valiaunt, hardie, and bolde,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="25"/>And not vnlearned, as the time was than,</L>
<L>Serched out of chronicles, bothe late and olde,</L>
<L>All that euer by thesame hath bee told:</L>
<L>How frō the begynnyng, Scotlāde dooeth reigne</L>
<L>Vnder kynges of Englande, as their souerain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ And Hardynges owne self hath the partie bee,</L>
<L>That from Scotlande, oft tymes, hath brought</L>
<L>Their seales of homage and fealtee,</L>
<L>Vnto the kyng of Englande, as he ought:</L>
<L>Vnto whom the Scottes then sued and sought,</L>
<L>Yeldyng to liue in humble subieccion,</L>
<L>Of Englandes gouernaunce and proteccion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ But that<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">that the. <HI REND="italic">edit. alt.</HI></NOTE> people of their propre nature</L>
<L>Hath, euen from the first, been so vntowarde,</L>
<L>So vnstedfast, inconstaunte, and vnsure,</L>
<L>That nothyng maie possibly bee more frowarde;</L>
<L>So haue thei continued from thens foorthwarde,</L>
<L>Neuer gladde to bee in quiet and rest,</L>
<L>But to defeccion aye readie and prest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Wherefore Ihon Hardyng, to his lorde &amp; maister,</L>
<L>Whom in his tyme he serued without blame,</L>
<L>Edwarde, first duke of Yorke, and after</L>
<L>Kyng of this realme, the fourthe of that name,</L>
<L>In this chronicle affermeth of thesame,</L>
<L>That thei will rebell, till, by prouision,</L>
<L>The kyng of Englād shall haue made theim both one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ And in deede Englād hath oft been cōstreigned,</L>
<L>The Scottes slackenesse in dooyng their homage,</L>
<L>To pricke forewarde, whē thei would haue refreined,</L>
<L>With y<SUP>e</SUP> sharpe spurre of marciall forceage;</L>
<L>And to abate their wantonnesse of courage,</L>
<L>With the iron rodde of due correccion,</L>
<L>As oft as thei attempted defeccion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ For y<SUP>e</SUP> Scottes will aye bee bostyng &amp; crakyng;</L>
<L>Euer sekyng causes of rebellion;</L>
<L>Spoyles, booties, and preades euer takyng;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="26"/>Euer sowyng quereles of dissension;</L>
<L>To burne and steale is all their intencion;</L>
<L>And yet, as people whom God dooeth hate &amp; curse,</L>
<L>Thei alwaies begynne, and euer haue the woorse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Englande hitherto hath neuer lacked power,</L>
<L>As oft as nede wer, the Scottes to compell</L>
<L>Their duetie to dooe; and menne of honour</L>
<L>Englande hath had, as stories dooe tell,</L>
<L>Whiche, whensoeuer the Scottes did rebell,</L>
<L>Wer hable, at all tymes, theim to subdue,</L>
<L>And their obedience to England renue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Emōges y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche noumbre, your noble father,</L>
<L>In the twelfth yere of Henry the seuenths reigne,</L>
<L>By aunciente recorde, as I can gather,</L>
<L>Beeyng of suche credence as cannot feigne,</L>
<L>Yode into Scotlande their pryde to restrein,</L>
<L>With sēbleable power, (as bookes dooen auowe)</L>
<L>And like commission as your grace had now.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ That season he did so valiauntely,</L>
<L>The Scottes vanquishyng and puttyng to flight,</L>
<L>That thei ranne awaye moste shamefully,</L>
<L>Not hable of hym tabide the sight,</L>
<L>Nor hable to sustein the brunt of his might.</L>
<L>Soondrie castelles he raced down to the grounde,</L>
<L>Whiche to the honour of Englande did redound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Kyng Iamy also, makyng greate braggue and vaūte,</L>
<L>Hauyng his armie not a myle of that daie,</L>
<L>Your father, as a captain valyaunt,</L>
<L>Made in a moment, for feare, to runne awaye:</L>
<L>The Scottish kyng, sēding foorth heraldes tway,</L>
<L>Chalenged your father, w<SUP>t</SUP> many a proude woorde,</L>
<L>Battayle to wage, and trye it by the sworde.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ And choose thou, sir Earle, quoth kyng Iamy then,</L>
<L>Whether we shall fight armie against armie,</L>
<L>Orelles I and thou tyre it manne for manne,</L>
<L>For sparyng bloodshed of either compaignie;</L>
<L>That if it chaunce me to haue the victorie,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="27"/>Nought shall I demaunde for Englandes losse &amp; thine,</L>
<L>Sauīg Barwike toune, for euer to bee mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Then to the heraldes saied this noble knight,</L>
<L>Shewe to your kyng, that in this place purposely</L>
<L>Battayle for to wage, my tentes haue I pight;</L>
<L>I am not come to flee, but to fyght sharpely,</L>
<L>As where he standeth, he maye see with his eye.</L>
<L>And fyrst where he would bloodshed saued to bee,</L>
<L>Therof am I no lesse desirous then he.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Secundarily, where it is his likyng,</L>
<L>That I, a poore earle, and of meane estate,</L>
<L>Maye combattre with hym, beyng a kyng,</L>
<L>That our two fightes may ceasse all debate,</L>
<L>He dooeth me honour, after suche highe rate,</L>
<L>That I must nedes graūt my selfe bound, in this case,</L>
<L>Humble thankes to rēdre to his grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Now as for the towne of Barwike, it is knowē</L>
<L>(Which your lorde requireth in case I bee slaine)</L>
<L>Is the kyng my souereins, and not mine owne:</L>
<L>So that graunte therof in me dooeth not remain.</L>
<L>But thys maie ye bear worde to your lord again,</L>
<L>My person and lyfe aduenture I shall,</L>
<L>More precyous to me then the round worlde all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ When kyng Iamy, by his heraldes twoo</L>
<L>Spedefullye returnyng, had due knowlage,</L>
<L>Muche otherwyse then he loked for thoo,</L>
<L>Of the earles stout aunswer and message,</L>
<L>Fled out of hand, and would no battayle wage:</L>
<L>So that your father retourned home victour,</L>
<L>With coumfort, laude, praise, ioye and honour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ The same your father, in the fyfth yere</L>
<L>Of our moost noble kyng Henry the eyght,</L>
<L>When hys grace and his armie at Turney were,</L>
<L>And the same kyng Iamy of Scotland streyght</L>
<L>Agaynst England his banner dyspleyght,</L>
<L>Vanquished the Scottes, &amp;, w<SUP>t</SUP> your helpyng hād,</L>
<L>Slew there king Iamy, and brought him to England.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="28"/>
<L>¶ Agayne in the. xv. yere of the same reygne,</L>
<L>Your selfe in proper personne, full courageous,</L>
<L>Set forth against y<SUP>e</SUP> Scottes, without dysdeygne,</L>
<L>Lyke a captayne valyaunt and venturous,</L>
<L>Wher ye brēt Iedworth, a toune right populous,</L>
<L>Wyth diuers victories that your grace then had,</L>
<L>Whiche made all Englande to reioyse &amp; be glad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ The yere folowyng also, as bookes testify,</L>
<L>The Scottes came, with an houge power</L>
<L>Of. lx. thousande men, vnder the duke of Albany,</L>
<L>Besiegyng Warke castel, thynkyng it to deuour;</L>
<L>But heryng that your grace dyd approach y<SUP>t</SUP> hour,</L>
<L>The Scottes trembled, and so dyd theyr duke,</L>
<L>And cowardly fled, to their shame and rebuke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Sembleably by thys your last viage,</L>
<L>Nowe thys last October and Nouember,</L>
<L>Made into Scotlande, to their great damage,</L>
<L>It dooeth, as me semeth, ryght well appere,</L>
<L>That when pleaseth our king to send you thether,</L>
<L>Your house in hys ryght is appoynted by God</L>
<L>To bee to the Scottes a sharpe scourge and rod.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wherfore thys chronycle of Ihon Hardyng,</L>
<L>I haue thought good to dedycate to your grace,</L>
<L>Because the same in euery maner of thyng</L>
<L>Doothe best set out the nature of that place,</L>
<L>With distaunce of tounes and euery myles space:</L>
<L>Besechyng your grace to take in good parte,</L>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE INTO THE <HI REND="italic">CHRONYCLE OF IOHN HARDYNG.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>EMonges all wryters that haue put in vre</L>
<L>Their penne and style, thynges to endite,</L>
<L>None haue behynd theim left so greate treasure,</L>
<L>Ne to their posteritee haue dooen suche delite,</L>
<L>As thei whiche haue taken peines to write</L>
<L>Chronycles and actes of eche nacion,</L>
<L>And haue of thesame made true relacion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ By Chronycles we knowe thynges auncient,</L>
<L>The succession of tymes, and menne,</L>
<L>The state of policies, with their regiment,</L>
<L>Howe long eche partie hath ruled, and when</L>
<L>And what were all their procedynges then.</L>
<L>Chronicles make reporte of matiers dooen</L>
<L>And passed many thousand yeres gooen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ By Chronycles we knowe in eche countre,</L>
<L>What men haue been of prowesse marciall,</L>
<L>What persones chiefly in actiuitee,</L>
<L>When and betwene whom warres haue befall,</L>
<L>Either ciuile, or els externall;</L>
<L>Howe the same haue been conueighed &amp; wrought,</L>
<L>Or els appeaced and to quiete brought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="31"/>
<L>¶ Chronicles dooe recorde and testifye,</L>
<L>Euen from the worldes first beginninges,</L>
<L>And dooe kepe in continuall memorie,</L>
<L>The course and processe of all maner thinges;</L>
<L>The liues and maners of princes and kynges,</L>
<L>Aswell Gentiles as Iudaicall,</L>
<L>Aswell iuste and godly as tyrannicall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ What persones to their prince and countree</L>
<L>Haue been louing, true and obedient,</L>
<L>And, at all times of necessitee,</L>
<L>Haue serued the same with good entent,</L>
<L>And constauntly therin haue their liues spent,</L>
<L>In Chronicles are regestred feithfully,</L>
<L>To their immortall honoure and glorye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Contrarye wise, who to their souerains,</L>
<L>Or to their countrees haue been wicked traitours,</L>
<L>Or, by collusion and crafty traines,</L>
<L>Haue rebelled against their gouernours,</L>
<L>Or the same to helpe haue been slacke proctours,</L>
<L>Are sembleably sette out by name,</L>
<L>To their endelesse infamy, reproche, and shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ These thinges, and others a thousande mo,</L>
<L>Wherby realmes haue decaied or growen,</L>
<L>Chaunged in processe, and altered to and fro,</L>
<L>Fruitefull and expedient to bee knowen,</L>
<L>Are in chronicles so plainly showen,</L>
<L>That thinges antique to vs bee as apparent,</L>
<L>As yf at their doinges we had been present.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Wherfore Goddes worde and holy scripture,</L>
<L>Whiche abandoneth all maner vanitee,</L>
<L>Yet of Chronicles admitteth the lecture,</L>
<L>As a thing of greate fruite and vtilitee,</L>
<L>And as a lanterne to the posteritee,</L>
<L>For example what they ought to knowe,</L>
<L>What waies to refuse, and what to folowe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ The bible bookes of Iudges and Kynges,</L>
<L>Althoughe moste full of high diuine misterie,</L>
<L>And farre surmounting all ethnike dooynges.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="32"/>Yet yf they bee read and take literally,</L>
<L>Hath the fourme and course of a plain historie:</L>
<L>What kynges serued God, and who trangressed,</L>
<L>Whiche thereby prospered, or wer oppressed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ The bookes of the kynges euery where,</L>
<L>Yf thinges seme touched ouer briefly,</L>
<L>To a larger storye dooeth vs referre,</L>
<L>Whiche were Chronicles of eche manne, truely</L>
<L>Sette out, at length, to our memorie.</L>
<L>Albeit those Chronicles (as it is euident)</L>
<L>Are loste, and dooe not remain at this present.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ The bookes inscribed Paralipomena,</L>
<L>A perfecte membre and piece of the Bible,</L>
<L>Is a summarye of the kynges of Iuda,</L>
<L>And therfore in Hebrue, it hath the title</L>
<L>And appellacion of a Chronicle.</L>
<L>The Machabees also, by my deming,</L>
<L>Is a plaine historye of holy writing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Whiche bookes, if they had neuer been set out,</L>
<L>It had been a greate maime to our knowlage,</L>
<L>A lamentable lacke, withouten doubte,</L>
<L>A greate cause of blindnesse to our age,</L>
<L>And to our faith inestimable damage:</L>
<L>But the spirite of God the authour was,</L>
<L>That those examples might bee our glasse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Chronicles, therefore, of true reporte,</L>
<L>Whether of Christian realmes or no,</L>
<L>Are matier of pleasaunce, fruite, and comforte,</L>
<L>And, for a thousande causes and mo,</L>
<L>Diligently to bee attended vnto:</L>
<L>Yea, and all maner writers of the same</L>
<L>Worthie laude, thanke, honoure, &amp; immortal fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Neither is any one to bee reiected,</L>
<L>That, in this behalfe, hath dooen his endeuoure;</L>
<L>For though some bee such as might bee corrected,</L>
<L>Yet those that haue therein bestowed laboure,</L>
<L>Haue minded to profyte vs to their power.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="33"/>Neither any is so full but somwhere dooeth faile,</L>
<L>Nor any so bare but dooeth somthing auaile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ And what an exceding benefite trowe ye</L>
<L>Is it for eche manne to have cognicion</L>
<L>Of all actes, bothe of his owne countree,</L>
<L>And also of euery forein nacion,</L>
<L>As yf he had liued when eche thing was dooen;</L>
<L>And to view the actes of antiquitee,</L>
<L>As though he did nowe presentlye theim see.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Chroniclers, therfore, I can highly cōmende,</L>
<L>And, emonge others, this authour Ihon Harding;</L>
<L>Who, with all his power, to this point did contēd,</L>
<L>To the vttermost extent of his learning,</L>
<L>That Englishe men might haue vnderstanding</L>
<L>Of all affaires touching their owne countree,</L>
<L>Euen to his dayes from olde antiquitee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ And though his cōning were not so muche</L>
<L>As some others, nor his intelligence,</L>
<L>Yet his good minde, entent, and zele was suche,</L>
<L>That in hym lacked no pointe of diligence,</L>
<L>After suche bookes as he thought of credence,</L>
<L>Feithfully to describe suche thinges in rime,</L>
<L>As happened to Englande from tyme to tyme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ But in thinges dooen before his owne dayes,</L>
<L>He foloweth his authours at auenture,</L>
<L>Without choice or difference of the true wayes,</L>
<L>Nor well assured who were corrupte or pure,</L>
<L>Nor whether they were certaine or elles vnsure;</L>
<L>Whether fabulous, or menne of veritee,</L>
<L>Whether vaine, or of good authoritee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ But, what soeuer in his owne time was dooen,</L>
<L>That he reporteth with all fidelitee,</L>
<L>Right so as eche thing ended or begonne,</L>
<L>Withoute any spotte of insynceritee,</L>
<L>Or dissimulation of the veritee.</L>
<L>He founde all meanes the veray trueth to know,</L>
<L>And, what he knewe certainly, that did he shewe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="34"/>
<L>¶ From the beginning of Henry y<SUP>e</SUP> fourth, kyng</L>
<L>Of this realme of Englande, after the conquest,</L>
<L>Euen to Edwarde the fourthes reigning,</L>
<L>Whiche was thre score yeres and one at the leste,</L>
<L>He leaueth nothing vnwriten at the largest,</L>
<L>That was, or semed to bee, of importaunce,</L>
<L>Touchyng peace and warre wyth Scotlande or Fraunce.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Vnto the Scottes he coulde neuer bee frende,</L>
<L>Because he sawe theim, towardes England,</L>
<L>False from the begynnyng, to the last ende;</L>
<L>Neuer standyng to anye league ne bande,</L>
<L>Homage, fealtee, ne wryting of theyr hande.</L>
<L>Neuer so readie to make rebellyon,</L>
<L>As when thei promised moost subiection.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ That, if Ihon Hardyng bee a trew man,</L>
<L>And in this behalfe inspyred with prophecie,</L>
<L>Thei wyll neuer bee but as thei were than,</L>
<L>False to England, suttle, and craftie,</L>
<L>Entendyng myschiefe when thei shewe contrary.</L>
<L>Spoylers and robbers that amende wyll neuer,</L>
<L>Tyll our kyng shall haue made theim Englyshe for euer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Neither is there anye that euer wrote,</L>
<L>Which in matiers of Scotland could better skill,</L>
<L>Nor which, their falshoode and vntrueth to note,</L>
<L>Had more affection or better wyll,</L>
<L>Or better knew water, woodde, toune, vale &amp; hyll.</L>
<L>Or was more feruente the Scottes to persue,</L>
<L>Who to England he knew woulde neuer be true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Neyther anye Chronicler that euer was,</L>
<L>Eyther dooth or can more largly declare,</L>
<L>Euen from Brutus, howe it came to passe</L>
<L>That kynges of Englande the soueraines are,</L>
<L>And ouer Scotlande oughte rule to beare.</L>
<L>Hymselfe is wytnes of their subiection,</L>
<L>And homage vnder Englandes protection.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ In other thinges the tymes were suche</L>
<L>That, though this werke haue some spice of blindnesse,</L>
<L>Yet is the authour not to be blamed much,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="35"/>For Popyshe errour, that season, doubtlesse</L>
<L>Did all the worlde ouer go and oppresse.</L>
<L>Therfore such thinges we must in good part take,</L>
<L>And pardon that faulte for the tymes sake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>¶ Yet haue we thought best, the autour to set out</L>

Et predictus Philippus per oratores et ambassiatores suos alligavit ibidem quod dicta Isabella fuit femina, que non potuit esse capax corone in capite suo, et quod regnum Francie fuit talliatum here-dibus masculis sancti Lodowici, cui ipse, quamvis dicta Isabella fuisset proxima de sanguine in linea directa, fuit proximus heres ad regnum &amp; coronam per talliam predictam et nullum seriptum aut specialitatem inde monstravit, nec offerebat monstrare, et pecut inde judicium. Vnde concordatum, et ex communi cousensu tocius consilii generalis diffinitum et determinatum fuit, quod predictus Edwardus habuit jus ad coronam et regnum Francie per medium dicte matris sue: sicut per jus divinum Ihesus Christus temporaliter &amp; humaniter pervenit ad coronam regni Judeorum per medium beate Marie matris sue. Et per jus humanum Francie notorie observatum vsitatum semper et approbatum, videlicet, si homo hereditatus mortuus non habeat filium quod ad filiam ejus transibit hereditas: et in libro Numeri sic approbatum, ubi Deus loquens Moisy in monte; sic de filiabus Salphaat hereditatem suam inter cognatos suos; et similiter diffinitum fuit in dicto generali consilio, si omnino oporteret predictum Edwardum jus suum predictum prosequi per guerram, quod ei bene liceat tam per subditos suos quam per alienos et amicos suos id prosequi, melioribus viis &amp; modis quibus melius ei videbitur expediri, non obstantibus alligacionibus quas Iohannes de Valois monstravit per nuncios suos in dicto consilio, omni via bone pacis petita &amp; prosecuta perantea ne effusio sanguinis Christiane fiat in ipsius defectu, &amp; ulterius determinatum fuit in dicto consilio quod quicquid per predictum consilium de Valesio heredes successores sive fautores suos quocunque modo post hec in prejudicium sive contrarium prosecucionis dicti Edwardi, in hac parte actum fit, erit, vel fuerit per usurpacionem, obstinacionem, aut vires violenter factas, seu imposterum faciend' injustum merito dici debeat et pro injusto tencatur.</P>
<P>ET post consilium predictum scripsit Philippo de Valois pro via bone pacis, et non fuit considerata ex parte Philippi sed denegata, quapropter Edwardus intravit Franciam cum armis Francie &amp; Anglie quarteratis, et combussit civitatem Tornacensem et mille villas in via Tornacensi, per consilium &amp; auxilium ducis Geller, ducis Brabancie, comitis Henaldie, et aliorum amicorum suorum in illis partibus. Et in temporibus istis Philippa regina peperit in Gaunt infra Flandriam Iohannem filium regis postea ducem Lancastrie.</P>

<P>ET cepit viam suam versus civitatem de Paris, et rex Philippus fecit omnes pontes in via sua rumpi, per quod rex Edwardus venit ad Poysy, ubi rex Philippus fecit pontem rumpi, et pontem de Seyntlo, quod non potuit ad Paris vemre, Philippo rege tune existente in Paris, ubi rex Edwardus cum exercitu suo ibidem requievit, et reperavit pontes predictos per tres noctes et tres dies donec illos duos pontes reperaverat, per quod pertransivit aquam de Sayne, ubi forte bellum et magna occisio Gallorum fuerunt deultra aquam de Sayne, et post bellum percussum cum victoria abinde removit cum exercitu suo.</P>

<P>Et cum sequenti die Dominica omnes simul convenissent, vento amicabiliter flante, exposuit vela ventis, circiter in mille quingentis navibus; et proximo die Martis, circa horam quintam, post nonam, intravit ostium fluminis de Sayne, ubi finxit anchoras corans villula de Kittecaus, per tria milliaria a villa de Harflete, uoi proposuit terram ascendere.</P>
<P>Et cum die Mercurii proximo sequenti, in vigilia Assumpciouis beate Marie, sol monstrasset pulcram auroram, inter horam sextam et septimam, premisit Iohanuem Holande comitem Huntyngdon, Gilbertum Vmfrevile nominatum comitem de Kyme, Iohannem Cornewaile, Iohannem Gray, Willielmum Porter, Iohannem Stewarde, cum aliis equitibus precursoribus ad explorandum patriam si aliqua hostiliter esset prope villam de Harflete et situm pro requiescione Regis et exercitus sui.</P>
<P>Et cum Rex cognovisset per relacionem predictorum nobilium quod ascensus stetit clare de inimicis in naviculis et . . . terre se appulit et cepit montem proximum versus Harflete inter quendam silvam non de grossis arboribus sed ceduam in declivo vallis versus aquam de Sayne ex una parte, et diversas villulas, pomeria, et clausuras, ex altera parte, quousque totus exercitus, equi et evecciones, ac alie necessarie fuissent de navibus ad terram asportata.</P>
<P>Mons vero et locus ascencionis Regis et exercitus sui erat valde petrosus pro defencione inimicorum, tam saxorum grandium quam minorum lapillorum ad jactum, si Regis ascensui resistere volutssent. Et in primo ascensu Regis, aute se, fiebant magne fosse, profunde, plene aqua, ac muri magni terrei grandis spissitudinis cum turribus armati et propugnaculis, ad modum castri: et inter unamquamque turran et propugnaculum terra dimittebatur integra non fossata ad altitudinem unius cubiti per unius hominis introitu &amp; exitu.

<P>Et cum die Sabbati sequente proxima omnia evecta que itineri erant necessaria de navibus erant asportata, Rex removit se cum exercitu suo monstrando se coram villam de Harflete super litus montis, et ex deliberatione et consilio prehabito misit fratrem suum ducem Clarencie cum competenti parte exercitus sui pro obsidione ponenda ex altera parte ville.

<P>Et die Lune Rex misit haraldum, nomine Guyen̄, cum domino de Gaucourte, ad Dolphinum, ad intimandum sibi quod expectaret apud villam suam de Harflete adhuc per octo dies tunc sequentes, ab eo petens responsum infra illud tempus si vellet venire cum eo ad pacem, et dimitti sibi facere jus suum absque duricia vel effusione sanguinis multitudinis, inter seipsos, persona ad personam per duellum terminarent, et utriusque regis consilio; sed lapsis inde octo diebus sine responso, iter suum arripuit versus villam snam Calesie que distat abinde plus quam centum miliaria Anglicana, precipiens exercitui suo se in victualibus instaurare pro octo dietis.</P>

Et die Iovis venit ad Bowes, et sic ad villam de Corby muratam, dimittendo eam a sinistris in valle ubi Rex indixit et precepit ut quilibet sagittarius faceret sibi palum vel baculum quadratum seu rotundum, sex pedum longitudinis, acutum in utroque fine, ad figendura coram se in terram unum finem et alterum finem in declino versus hostes tempore belli.</P>
<P>Et die Veneris Rex hospitahatur in villulis prope villam de Neell muratam ubi nunciatam fuit Regi de duobus locis ubi potuit pertransire aquam de Sowme qua de causa premisit dominum Gilbertum Vmfrevile comitem de Kyme, Willielmum Porter, Iohannem Cornewaile et Willielmum Bourser, cum penonibus suis, custodire passagium exercitus ultra aquam predictam, qui illud custodierunt a meredie usque ad unam horam infra noctem. Et die Sabbati pertransivit Rex et totus exercitus ad duo loca predicta, ubi magnus mariscus fuit ex utraque parte aque predicte, et ad duo calceta inter mariscos pertransitus totus exercitus, qui quidem custodes passagü illud custodierunt a meredie diei usque ad unam horam noctis.</P>
<P>Et die Dominica sequente Dux de Orliaunce et Dux de Bourbone miserunt tres haraldos Regi quod pugnarent cum eo. Et die Lune Rex venit prope villam de Peron̄ muratam, dimittendo eam a sinistris per unum miliare. Et deinde Rex venit ad aquam de Suerdes et transivit ultra. Et die Martis, ac die Mercurii hospitabatur Rex et exercitus in villulis, ubi habuerunt visum de maximo exercitu Gallicorum. Et die Iovis Rex statim removit exercitum semper equitando arraiati adversum eos, et ad solis occasum Gallici hospitabantur in villulis et ortis prope Regem. Et cum Rex viderat hoc et quod quilibet clamavit et vociferavit pro famulo, amico, et socio, ut moris est, precepit exercitum suum hospita . . . vociferacione sub certa pena in villa de Agencourte prope hostes usque ad mane.</P>
<P>Et die Veneris, in festo sanctorum Crispini et Crispiniani, surgente aurora Gallici se constituerunt in exercitu in aciebus, turmis, et cuneis, coram Rege in dicto campo de Agencourte, in via et transitu suo versus Calisiam. Et interim Rex constituit se in bello ibi prope hostes, ponens Edwardum Ducem Eboraci in acie anteriori, et dominum de Camoys in acie posteriori, pro alis dextra &amp; sinistra. Et Rex appropinquavit versus hostes, et hostes versus eum, et per durum prelium percussum Rex habuit victoriam, ubi occisi erant Dux de Barre, Dux de Braban, Dux de Alaunson, Comites quinque, Barones et vexilla levantes nonaginta, mille quinquaginta milites, et maxima multitudo populi, secundum computacionem haraldorum ad numerum centum milia hominum: et capti fuerant Dux de Orlience Lodowicus, frater Regis Francie, Dux de Burbone, Comes de Vendismo, Arthurus de Britayne comes de Richemonde, et Comes de Ewe, ac dominus Bursigaldus Marescallus Francie, ex parte Francie; et ex parte Anglorum occisi erant Edwardus Dux Eboraci, Michael de la Pole comes Suffolchie, juvenis, duo milites de novo insigniti, et decem alie persone.</P>
<P>Cumque dominus noster Rex, post finitum prelium, ex humanitate et maxima audacia, in villa de Agencourte, et in eodem loco ubi pernoctavit et requievit nocte precedente, pernoctasset. Et die Sabbati iter suum arripuit versus per illum locum ubi bellum fuit percussum, amare lamentando in corde effusionem tantam Christianorum occisorum, qui numerabantur ad centum milia hominum, ubi Rex non habuit ultra ix mɫ. de viris infirmis et sanis pugnantibus. Et di Martis, in crastino sanctorum Simonis et Iude venit Rex cum toto exercitu ad Calisiam cum magno gaudio populi et leticia, ubi laudes soli Deo pro victoria faciens decantari cum maxima devocione, litera F, tunc dies Dominica Anno Domini M<SUP>o</SUP>.
