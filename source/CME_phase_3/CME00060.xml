<P>Dieses stück ist von verschiedenen händen geschrieben, deren letzte, von der mitte von fol. 109 bis zum schlusse, der der vier ersten stücke schr ähnlich und vielleicht mit dieser identisch ist, während fol. 90-109 eine mehr eckige und schnörkelige handschrift zeigen.</P>
<P>Im anfange des ms. findet sich ein inhaltsverzeichniss von der hand des Douce, der zugleich bei Christina Mirabilis auf Fabricii Bibl. med. aev. IV, 60 und bei Maria Oigniacensis auf Fabricius VI, 595 hinweist, aber den fehler begeht, die latei∣nische vita der Christina Mir. dem Jacobus Acconensis zuzu∣schreiben.</P>
<P>Alle diese stücke sind übersetzungen aus dem Lateinischen.</P>
<P>Als verfasser der latein. vita der h. Elisabeth von Spael∣beek nennt sich im anfange der engl. übersetzung Dan Philip of Clarevall, der bei gelegenheit der visitation der klöster seines ordens (er war wol Cistercienser) die heilige persönlich aufsuchte und diese vita in ihrem zwanzigsten jahre schrieb. Diese latein. vita ist bisher nicht bekannt, so dass die hier zum ersten male abgedruckte engl. übersetzung an stelle der∣selben sehr willkommen sein muss. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Spezialwerke über belgische heilige sind: J.

Okt., in ihrer heimat am 19. Nov. gefeiert (vgl. Stadler, Heiligenlexikon; Potthast). Die herausgeber der Act. SS. Bolland, Oct. VIII, s. 384 bemerken über sie nur:</P>

Octobris; item in Fiseno nostro et Kalendariis Cisterciensibus. 'Medi∣tationi, inquit Arturus, Passionis Christi sic addicta erat, ut et illius stigmata (ut fertur) in suo corpore tulerit impressa'. Abstinentiae haud vulgaris fuit. Obiit post medium saeculum decimum tertium (die engl. übersetzung gibt am schlusse 1266 als todesjahr an). Nullae illius noscuntur reliquiae, nec icones videntur in sacris aedibus, nec alia cultus liturgici seu ecclesiastici deprehenduntur vestigia. In populo viget ejus memoria die praecipue XIX. Nov., quo etiam occurrit in Auctario ad Natales Sanctorum Belgii Molani. Forte—vix ulla tamen affulget spes—praefato die licebit ejus vitam dare.</Q>
<P>Die zweite legende (worin der verfasser der vita sich nicht nennt) ist eine wörtliche übertragung der vita S. Christinae mirabilis Trudonopoli in Hasbania auctore Thoma Cantim∣pratensi ord. praedicatorum († 1263), in den Act. SS. Boll. 24. Juli, bd. V, s. 650-660 (anfang: Memorabilis Christi virginis Christinae vitam scribere disponentes, illud in exordio sermonis primitus inseramus quod venerabilis Jacobus Achonensis epi∣scopus, postea Romanae curiae Cardinalis, in vita b. Mariae de Oignies de ipsa Christina per haec verba commemorat. Vidi, inquit, aliam (Christinam intellige), circa quam tam mirabile operatus est dominus quod, cum diu mortua jacuisset, ante∣quam in terra corpus ejus sepeliretur, anima ad corpus rever∣tente revixit).</P>
<P>Ueber diese heilige vgl. auch Fabricius l. c. und Pinius Commentarius praevius in Act. SS. Dieselbe heilige behandelt das gedicht: Leven van s. Christine de Wonderbare in oud∣dietsche Rymen, naer een pergam. Hs. uit de 14 of 15 Eeuw, ed. H.

<P>Das leben der h. Marie von Oignies ist eine übertragung der vita b.

Translationis in novam arcam factae a. 1608 ib. 678-689. Ueber diese heilige vgl. noch Fabricius Bibl. (ed. Mansi) VI, s. 248 und Papebroch Commentarius praevius in Act. SS. Boll. s. 630-636. Eine neuere franz. übersetzung erschien unter dem titel: Vie de la bienheureuse Marie d'Oignies par le Car∣dinal de Vitry, avec un supplément de Thomas de Cantimpré, Nivelles 1822.—Der engl. übersetzer theilt in einem prolog mit, dass er das prooemium, welches Jacobus von Vitry zu dieser vita an den bischof von Toulouse geschrieben und worin er von den wundern h. frauen der diözese von Lüttich aus∣führlich handele, wegen der schwierigkeit der übertragung des figurenreichen stiles auslasse.</P>
<P>Das latein. original des briefes des Stephan von Senis (vom jahre 1411) über die h. Katharina von Senis findet sich, unter anderen vitae dieser heiligen, in den Act. SS. Boll. 30. April, bd. III, s. 961-967.</P>
<P>Dem ersten stücke schickt der engl. 'compilour' ein kurzes vorwort (apologe) voraus, worin er angibt, dass er, der nur 'symple-letterd' sei, weder im stande sei noch beabsichtige wört∣lich genau zu übertragen, sondern dem sinne folgen wolle, ohne jedoch wesentliches auszulassen, ausgenommen citate aus der h. schrift, die ohne nähere erklärung in englischer über∣tragung dunkel sein würden.—Am schlusse der legenden, nach dem briefe über S. Katharina von Senis, folgt 'a shorte Apologetik of þis englisshe compyloure', worin er bescheiden die leser bittet, nicht allzu kritisch zu sein in hinsicht seines stiles oder weil er bald nördliches bald südliches Eng∣lisch vermische; man wolle seine fehler nicht der überhebung, sondern seiner unwissenheit und seinem gehorsam beimessen: er habe diese arbeit auf die bitte seines oberen (souereyn) unternommen, die für ihn befehl sei, da ja 'Est orare patrum species violenta jubendi'—was er überträgt: 'a priours preyynge til obeyand monke is a bidynge'. Daraus ergibt sich dass der übersetzer ein klostermönch gewesen und diese übertragung auf bitten seines priors angefertigt. Er setzt in einer note noch hinzu, dass er ancilla Christi mit Christes mayden und super∣lative wie optumus durch ful gode widergegeben, et sic in similibus.</P>
<P>Die abhandlung: Of þe seuene poyntes of trewe loue and euerlastynge wisdame nennt sich im eingang einen auszug aus
<PB N="106" REF="5"/>
einem lat. Orologium Sapientiae (so genannt 'bye-cause þat þe mater<HI REND="italic">e</HI> þer<HI REND="italic">e</HI>-of was schewede to him þat wrote hit, as in a visione vndere þe fygure and liknesse of a wonder<HI REND="italic">e</HI> fayr<HI REND="italic">e</HI> Orloge'), dessen verfasser, ein dominikanermönch, unbekannt sei. Sie behandelt, in form eines dialogs zwischen heavenly Wisdom (d. i. Christus) und dem verfasser (als 'discyple' dieser weisheit) sieben punkte der liebe zur göttlichen weisheit und die pflichten des dieser weisheit nachstrebenden jüngers. In der einleitung, die an eine hochstehende edle dame gerichtet ist, nennt der engl. übersetzer sich einen kaplan dieser dame und ihren geistlichen vater und sagt dass er ihr zu liebe, die gleichfalls dieser weisheit nachstrebe, und auf ihren wunsch diese übersetzung angefertigt, wobei er, die persönlichen be∣merkungen des latein. verfassers übergehend, nur das erbauliche berücksichtigt, die ordnung seiner quelle seinem zwecke gemäss zu ändern sich erlaubt und nicht wort für wort, sondern, wie es für das gemeine verständniss passend, dem sinne nach über∣tragen habe; er sei lange bedenklich gewesen diese übersetzung des ihm theuren buches zu unternehmen wegen der masse von büchern und übersetzungen, die jetzt umliefen, aber vielleicht könne sein buch, da viele veränderung lieben, doch manchen gefallen und nützen. Es ist kaum anzunehmen, dass dieser kaplan mit dem übersetzer der legenden, einem klosterbruder, identisch sei, obwol die handschrift an demselben orte und vielleicht theilweise von demselben schreiber geschrieben scheint und die sprachlichen formen in beiden werken sehr ähnlich sind.</P>
<P>Das ms. ist jedoch nicht original, sondern nur abschrift, und daher auch nicht ohne mancherlei fehler.</P>
<P>Auf der letzten seite des ms. steht die notiz: Iste liber est domus belle Vallis ordinis Cartus. in comitatu Notyngh<HI REND="italic">a</HI>m, von einer nicht viel späteren hand als das ms.; darüber steht a. r. Beauvall.</P>
<P>Hiernach liegt die vermuthung nahe, dass das ms. selbst an diesem orte, dem es in nicht viel späterer zeit angehörte, oder doch in dessen nachbarschaft geschrieben ist und somit den dialekt dieser gegend widergibt; womit trefflich über∣einstimmt, dass der übersetzer der legenden am schlusse um nachsicht bittet, wenn er nördliches und südliches Englisch vermenge.</P>
