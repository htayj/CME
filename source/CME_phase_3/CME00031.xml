<CELL ROLE="label">Description.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Bodl. 288.</CELL>
<CELL>T.</CELL>
<CELL>A fine folio, double columned and well orna∣mented, containing, besides the 'Super Cantica Sacra,' nothing but Hampole's Psalter and Com∣mentary, <HI REND="italic">inc.</HI> 'Grete haboundance.'</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Magd. Coll. Oxford, 52.</CELL>
<CELL>U.</CELL>
<CELL>A small thick volume, containing exactly what is contained in Bodl. 288, of which I am inclined to think it a copy.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Bodl. 789.</CELL>
<CELL>V.</CELL>
<CELL>This is a beautiful text, written in clear sharply cut regular characters on the finest vellum, with elaborate rubrics and illuminations; size about that of an octavo volume. It is a collection of devotional and hortatory pieces, made probably for some person of rank. Besides II, III, and V of this volume, it contains Archbishop Thoresby's 'Sixe thingis,' &amp;c., and several me∣ditations and prayers, taken from the works of St. Bernard and St. Bonaventure.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Bodl. 647.</CELL>
<CELL>W.</CELL>
<CELL>A curious and important MS., written in the West-Midland dialect, with Northern peculiarities. The workmanship is rough and uncouth. It contains little that has not been printed in the present volume; the text of Tracts IX, XIX, XX, XXIV, XXV, XXXI, and XXXII, being based upon it.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>C. C. C. Camb. 296.</CELL>
<CELL>X.</CELL>
<CELL>A small folio, full of clerical inaccuracies, and making no pretensions to textual splendour, but containing many treatises not found elsewhere. See Shirley's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue,</HI> pp. 40-45. The hand is of the end of the fourteenth or beginning of the fifteenth century. Tracts XIII, XIV, XVII, XVIII, XXII, and XXIII, of the present edi∣tion, are taken from this MS.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Lambeth 408.</CELL>
<CELL>Y.</CELL>
<CELL>This MS. I have not seen; it supplied the text for Tracts VI, VII, and VIII.</CELL>
</ROW>
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
<ROW>
<CELL>Douce 274.</CELL>
<CELL>Z.</CELL>
<CELL>A small thin volume, with beautiful initial letters in gold; writing pale; date, late fourteenth century. This is one of the MSS. bequeathed by Mr. Douce to the Bodleian Library.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Trin. Coll. Dub. C. III. 12.</CELL>
<CELL>AA.</CELL>
<CELL>A volume about 8 in. by 6 in.; totally without ornament; the hand passes in the strangest way from the clerkly to the cursive, and back again from the cursive to the clerkly. In several places there are lacunae. Through the greater portion of its contents it agrees with C.C.C.C. 296; yet I doubt whether either MS. be a copy of the other, but rather suspect that both were copied from some earlier text now lost. Tracts XII and XXI are taken from this MS.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Douce 273.</CELL>
<CELL>BB.</CELL>
<CELL>The description of Z applies exactly to this MS., except that it makes a thicker volume. Besides IX and XXIX of this volume, it contains a piece of unknown authorship in English, entitled 'Tractatus de Regibus.'</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Trin. Coll. Dub. C. V. 6.</CELL>
<CELL>CC.</CELL>
<CELL>A small volume, about 6 in. by 4 in., in a cursive hand, of, I should say, the first or second decade of the fifteenth century. As it contains but little,—at least of what may with reason∣able probability be assigned to Wyclif,—that is not found also in Oxford MSS., I have had re∣course to it for the text of one tract only, XXVI.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Harl. 2398.</CELL>
<CELL>DD.</CELL>
<CELL>I have not seen this MS. The text of IV is de∣rived from an accurate transcript taken from it by Mr. Brock.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Corser MS.</CELL>
<CELL>EE.</CELL>
<CELL>Neither have I seen this MS., which is the pro∣perty of Mr. Corser, and has but recently come to light; but a useful collation of it with the Harleian MS. (DD) was obtained for me by my friend, Mr. Furnivall.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Laud 174.</CELL>
<CELL>FF.</CELL>
<CELL>A small volume, now in the Bodleian Library, containing (besides XV of this volume, for which it has supplied the text), portions of I, a curious poem by Richard of Maydenstoon, and other pieces.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Harl. 2385.</CELL>
<CELL>GG.</CELL>
<CELL>A small thin quarto, among the Harleian MSS. at the Museum. About seven leaves of it belong to Wyclif. See below, pp. 93 and 441.</CELL>
</ROW>
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
<ROW>
<CELL>Tiberius C. VII.</CELL>
<CELL>HH.</CELL>
<CELL>This is one of the Cottonian MSS. at the British Museum; it was much injured by the fire of 1731, but has been most skilfully and effectually repaired. It is a copy of Knyghton's <HI REND="italic">Chronicle,</HI> and, I am disposed to think, in his own hand∣writing. The text of XXX and XXXI is derived from it.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Claudius E. III.</CELL>
<CELL>II.</CELL>
<CELL>Another Cottonian MS. The copy of Knyghton's <HI REND="italic">Chronicle</HI> which it contains is evidently tran∣scribed from Tiberius C. VII.</CELL>

<HEAD>I. SUPER CANTICA SACRA.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[Bishop Bale's catalogue is the only authority for ascribing this Com∣mentary on the Canticles to Wyclif. But in the same catalogue the well∣known Commentary on the Psalms, beginning 'Grete haboundaunce of gostly comfort,' is ascribed to Wyclif, whereas it has been shown with abundant evidence by the editors of the Wycliffite versions of the Bible (Preface, p. iv) to be the work of Richard Rolle, commonly called Ham∣pole. Now, in most (perhaps in all) of the copies of the Commentary on the Psalms—which we will call Hampole's Psalter—the Commentary on the Canticles follows without a break, and, so to speak, as a matter of course, in such a manner as to give rise to a strong presumption that Ham∣pole was the author of both. But against this presumption had to be set the undoubted fact that the Commentary on the Canticles bears in several places decisive marks of a Lollard or Puritanical cast of sentiment, which no one acquainted with Hampole's genuine writings, and with his life and character, so far as known, could possibly father upon him. It was mani∣festly the fact of the occurrence of these Lollard passages which induced Bale, and many others since his time, to attribute the Commentary to Wyclif. Out of these difficulties, some introductory verses prefixed to a copy of the Psalter and Canticles, contained in a MS. of about the middle of the fifteenth century (Laud, 286), seem to afford the means of extrica∣tion. This MS. stops short at the seventh canticle, the Magnificat, omit∣ting those five, the commentary on which in Bod. 288 and other MSS. contains most of the Lollard passages before mentioned. The writer of the introductory lines, after saying that this is the same Psalter as that which lies chained at Richard's own place of burial, in the nunnery at Hampole, thus proceeds:—</P>
<LG>
<L>'Copyed has þis Sauter ben of yvel men of Lollardry,</L>
<L>And aftirward hit has bene sene ympyd in wiþ eresy.</L>
<L>They seyden þen to leude foles, þat it shuld be all enter</L>
<L>A blessyd boke of hur scoles, of Richard Hampole þe Sauter.</L>
<L>Thus ho þei seyd to make þem leve on her scole thoro sotilte,</L>
<L>To bring hem in, so hem to greve, ageyn þe feyth in grete fole;</L>
<L>And sclaundrid foule þis holy man wiþ her wykkid waryed wyles;' &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="4" REF="27"/>
The Lollards then, it seems, had been grafting heresy, that is, their peculiar opinions, into the Psalter (in which general expression it seems certain that the Canticles are included) of Richard Hampole, and then circulating it as, in its entirety, 'a blessed book of their schools.' From these words it may clearly be inferred that the copy to which these lines are prefixed, and in which the handwriting is the same throughout, was the genuine work of Hampole, free from all Lollard interpolations. What difference this makes in the Psalter itself, I am not prepared to say with certainty; but the form which it wears in Bod. 288 (a MS. containing all the passages of advanced Lollardism in the Canticles) appears, from a tolerably close examination, to present scarcely anything that could be decidedly pronounced to come from a Lollard pen. But in the Commentary on the Canticles, the difference caused by presenting them in the form exhibited in the copy of this ardent versifier, as compared with that which they bear in Bod. 288, is very great. The former copy, containing only seven canticles, has not a single word which might not have been written by Hampole. The latter, containing twelve canticles, has in it, especially in the commentary on the Benedictus, passages which only Wyclif or one of his disciples could have composed. The conclusion which I arrive at therefore is, that in this Commentary on the Canticles, we have, down to the end of the seventh canticle, a genuine work of Richard Hampole, retouched in certain MSS. by a Lollard hand, but that the five remaining canticles are a later addition, made either by Wyclif himself, or by his school. Some confirmation of this view may be found in the fact that the valuable New College MS. (No. 95) of which, nearly, if not absolutely, all the remaining contents are of Wyclif's compo∣sition, gives just these five later canticles, and none of the seven earlier ones.</P>
<P>The text is based on Bod. 288 (T in this edition). The scribe seems to have been imperfectly acquainted with Latin, and has made frequent blunders in quoting the Latin originals; these I have corrected either from other MSS. or from the Vulgate. Other MSS. of the whole or of a portion of the Canticles are the following; of the whole, Laud 448, University College, Oxford, 56 (although in this MS. the <HI REND="italic">commentary</HI> on the last six canticles is wanting, as if the scribe had been afraid to reproduce it); Magdalen College, Oxford, 52; of Nos. 1-7, Laud 286; of Nos. 8-12, New College, Oxford, 95; of Nos. 11, 12, Laud 174; of No. 12, Douce 258.</P>
<P>'In the Old Testament Canticles there is no agreement with either Wyc∣liffite version; in the Benedictus and Nunc Dimittis the agreement is very close with the earlier version.'—Shirley's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue,</HI> p. 37.</P>
<P>These twelve canticles (or rather these eleven canticles and one creed, the so-called Symbolum Athanasii) are found intermixed among the Psalms, as they are appointed to be read on the different days of the week in the Psalter of the Roman Breviary (ed. Lyons, 1546). Thus a commentator, who besides commenting on the Psalms, should have explained these canticles, would have given a commentary on the entire contents of the Psalter in his Breviary, with the exception of the Symbolum Apostolorum.]</P></HEADNOTE>

No higher authority for the legend mentioned in the text is known, than that of a spurious chronicle, ascribed to Dacius, a successor of St. Ambrose, but really written five centuries later. The rudiments of a large portion of the hymn may be traced, as has been shown by Archdeacon Freeman in his ex∣cellent work, <HI REND="italic">Principles of Divine Service,</HI> in Oriental liturgies. But in its actual form, a preponderance of testimony seems to trace it back to Gaul; the earliest author named for it is Hilary of Poitiers (circa 354). If so it would be not one of the least precious gifts to Christianity from the glorious church of Gaul, well and fittingly called 'the eldest daughter of the Church.'</NOTE>, whanne Austin was convertid.

<P>Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel, quia visitavit et fecit redempcionem plebis sue. Þis psalm is of moore auctorite þan þe song bifore, for it is bileeve of þe gospel, as Seint Luk telliþ; and Zacharie, Baptistis fadir, seide first þis salme aftir þat he was dombe, as Gabriel toolde him. And as myracle was bifore in dombnes and ȝevynge of speche, so in seyinge of þis salm was more myracle, whanne God liȝted þis profete and teelde him hid truþis.

Þis salme is songen in þe Chirche at þe eende of mateyns, for Joon Baptist was lan∣tirne bifore þe sunne, to make redy to take þe liȝt of þis sunne, as þis salm is sungun bifore þe sunne rising.

<P>Quicunque vult salvus esse ante omnia opus est ut teneat Catholicam fidem. It is seid comounli þat þere ben þre credis. Þe first is Apostlis, þat men knowen comounly. Þat oþere is crede of þe Chirche þat declariþ þe former crede. Þis þridde crede is of þe Trynyte, þe whiche is sungun as a salme, and was made in Greek speche of oon þat is clepid Athanasie, and was aftir turnyd to Latyn, and sum deel amendid, and ordeyned to be seid at þe first hour <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>With reference to the statement in the text, the following summary of the account given of this creed in the learned work of Dr. Harold Browne, Bishop of Ely <HI REND="italic">(Exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles),</HI> may be not out of place.</P>
<P>Ecclesiastical writers, down to and including Baronius, assigned the creed to Athanasius without hesita∣tion. His authorship was first dis∣puted by Vossius and Ussher in the middle of the seventeenth century. The Frenchman, Qusnel, writing in 1675, gave it to Vigilius Thap∣sensis, an African bishop of the latter end of the fifth century; and to this hypothesis Cave, Pagi, Bing∣ham, and others assented. In 1693, a French divine, named Antelmi, made out a case of considerable strength in favour of assigning its composition to St. Vincent of Lerins. Lastly, Waterland, writing a few years later, strongly and most ably advocated the claim of Hilary, bishop of Arles in 429, to be con∣sidered the author.</P>
<P>Direct external testimony to the authorship there is none. But a variety of indications point, (as we saw was the case also with the <HI REND="italic">Te Deum,)</HI> to the Church of Gaul as the source of its composition. The internal testimony, afforded by the peculiar cast of doctrine, and by significant omissions no less than significant statements, is said to fix the date at a period before the spread of Nestorianism, and after the appearance of St. Augustine's works on the Trinity, i.e. between 416 and 431. But if composed at that particular period, and com∣posed in Gaul, it is not likely to have had any other author than one of two men, Hilary of Arles, and St. Vincent of Lerins;—and Water∣land argues very ingeniously for the former.</P></NOTE>.

<HEAD>II. ÞE TEN COMAUNDEMENTIS.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[The following tract on the Ten Commandments is found in at least two different forms, beginning alike, but soon diverging. The one here printed is that found in the beautiful MS. Bodl. 789. The other may be seen in the following MSS., Laud 524, and Univ. Coll. 97. There are two other MSS., according to Shirley's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue,</HI> at Dublin and in the British Museum; but I have not examined either closely.</P>
<P>The version found in the Laud and Univ. Coll. MSS. is considerably fuller than that here printed; but it is at the same time tamer, and less characteristic. It might have been written by any well-meaning priest living at the time, but the Bodl. MS. contains quite different touches. The attack upon non-preaching priests at p. 87, the assertion of the ultra-Puritan doctrine of dominion being founded in grace (p. 88), and the exhortation to the reading of the Scriptures (p. 90), if they do not prove the tract to have been by Wyclif, at any rate show it to be of Wycliffite or Lollard origin. Now not one of these passages is found in the mild and colourless commentary of the Laud MS. I am inclined to think that the author—and I see no reason why it should not have been Wyclif—found a pre-existing commentary, which he used as the vehicle for the introduction of his views. The tract is ascribed to Wyclif by Bishop Bale, under the title 'Compendium Decem Praeceptorum.']</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>III. THE PATER NOSTER.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[It has been shown in the Introduction to this volume that there is no valid reason for connecting this tract, or the short commentary on the Ave Maria which follows it, with the other pieces included by Dr. Shirley under the general title of <HI REND="italic">Speculum Vitae Christianae,</HI> the authorship of which has been clearly traced to Archbishop Thoresby. The authority of Bale, such as it is, may, I think, be produced in favour of ascribing this tract to Wyclif. In his longer list we find, Super Oratione Dominicâ, <HI REND="italic">inc.</HI> 'Docet nos Dominus Jesus Christus.' This commencement is sufficiently near to that of the tract before us to make it probable that the same work is referred to, especially as it is immediately followed in all the four MSS. (V, Y, CC, GG) which contain it, by the tract Super Salutatione Angelica, or on the Ave Maria, the first words of which, as given in the Catalogue of Bale, manifestly agree with those of the extant work. Again, the tract on the Ave Maria, with which in all the MSS. this tract on the Pater Noster is so closely linked, bears in the Harleian text the name of Wyclif. No internal evidence points to Wyclif or any one else; but the fine con∣cluding passage proves the writer, whoever he was, to have been a man of an elevated way of thinking.</P>

<HEAD>IV. ÞE PATER NOSTER.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[The only ground for ascribing the following treatise to Wyclif, besides internal evidence, is the fact of its being found in a volume of Wyclif's sermons at Wrest Park. (See Shirley's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue,</HI> No. 64, English works). The style much resembles, I think, that of Wyclif. There is a remarkable passage near the end, where the writer speaks of the obstacles thrown in the way of those who were endeavouring to preach the gospel generally among the people, but mentions no definite forms of persecution. Hence I should judge that, if by Wyclif, this treatise is, compared with most of his English works, of early date, composed after he had sent out the 'poor priests,' but before persecution had commenced.</P>
<P>Two other copies, for the knowledge of which I am indebted to Mr. Bond and Mr. Furnivall, have come to light since the appearance of Dr. Shirley's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue;</HI> one at the British Museum (Harl. 2398), the other in the possession of Mr. Corser. The present text is taken from a correct transcript of the Harleian MS., made by Mr. Brock.]</P></HEADNOTE>
<P>SYþþþE þe Pater Noster is þe beste prayer þat is, for in it mot <NOTE PLACE="marg">Introductory.</NOTE> alle oþer prayers be closed yf þey schulle graciouslyche be hurde of God, þerfore scholde men kunne þis prayour, and studie þe wyt þerof.

And syþþe it is þe gospel of Crist, and Crist bad it be preched to þe peple, for þe peple scholde lerne and kunne it and worche þerafter, why may we nouȝt wryte in Englyssche þe gospel, and oþere þynges declaryng þe <NOTE PLACE="marg">An apology for the use of English.</NOTE> gospel, to edificacion of Cristen mennus soules, as þe precheour telleþ it trewelyche an Englyssche to þe peple?

resoun þat it scholde nouȝt be wryte, it scholde nouȝt be preched. Þis heresye and blaspheme scholde men putte oute fro here hertes, for it spryngeþ up by þe fende, þer as Crist seyþ, þe fende is fader of lesynges. And so þe kynreden of Pharyseys is cursed of God, þat loveþ nouȝt Jesus, as Seynt Poul seyþ, bot letteþ þe gospel to be lerned of þe peple. For yf þer be any sotilte lyȝtere þan oþer, for to kunne a crafte þat is nedeful, he þat can þis sotilte and wol nouȝt teche þe lerner able þerto, he is cause of his unkunnyng. And so wrytyng of þe gospel in Englyssche, and <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">From EE; om. DD.</NOTE> of goede lore accordyng þerto, is a sotilte and a mene to þe commune peple, to kunne it þe betere. Who loveþ lasse Crist? who is acursid of God, bot he þat letteþ þis mene? for he is Sathanas contrarie to Crist. Bot þes wyckede kynrede wolde þat þe gospel slepte; bot, for þey bere þe name of Crist, þey preche somwhat þerof. And þus dude þe Machamete and Surgeus þe monk, whanne þey made a lawe after þer owene malys and toke somwhat of þe gospel to a fleschlyche understondyng, so þat þurghe þe lore of hem heþene folk to þis day beþ oute of here byleve.

<P>Leve we now þis mater, and speke we of þe Pater Noster <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord's Prayer contains seven petitions, of which three relate to God, and four to man.</NOTE> þat Jesus Crist made.

Þe firste perteyneþ to þe Fader, to whom power is apropried, of whom, as seyþ holy wryt, is alle power in hevene and in erþe.

<HEADNOTE><P>[The evidence connecting the following tract with Wyclif may be deemed tolerably satisfactory. Besides being mentioned by Bale, under the title of <HI REND="italic">De Peccatis fugiendis,</HI> it is the first tract in a small MS. volume (Bodl. 647), nearly all the contents of which are known or reputed to be by Wyclif. The Bodleian Library has a second copy of it (Douce 273), and there is a third at Dublin (Trin. Coll. Dubl. c. v. 6). The text is based on Bodl. 647, a MS. written in the West Midland dialect. The internal evidence proves the tract to be of Lollard origin, but no more. Yet the passage about the right to resume church endowments if misused, (p. 154), sounds like the voice of Wyclif; as does also the rough humour in the comparison (p. 139) of the feats of a knight to those of a hangman. The mention of the romance of the 'batel of Troye,' were it necessary to understand it of the version made by Lydgate, would indeed fix the date of the composition to a period subsequent to Wyclif's death. But, not to speak of the old and well-known French version of Guido delle Colonne, which had been long in circulation, and English metrical version is known to have been made by John Barbour, author of the <HI REND="italic">Brus.</HI> See Morley's <HI REND="italic">English Writers,</HI> vol. ii, part 1, p. 432.]</P></HEADNOTE>

Peyne comes to Gods childer to purge hom of synne, and peyne comes to mony men to kepe hom fro synne, and peyne comes to oþer men to schewe þat God hatis synne. And so, as God is þe beste þing in þo world, so is synne þo worste þing in þo world. And so, where alle oþer þingis ben Gods creatures, synne is made wiþ∣oute God, as Seynt Jon seis.

Synne is so yvel, þat for al þis world a mon schulde not synne, ȝe, liȝtly in his þoȝt; ne God may not bidde a mon for his godenesse do synne; ne synne may not serve God, alþof hit profite.

Ffirst for hyenesse þat he hafs of giftis of grace; as men þat ben ypocritis hyen hom in holynes, and somme men hyen hom in witte þat God haves gyven hom, and sum men hyen hom in giftis of kynde, as sum men ben proude of bodily strenght, and sum men ben proude of bodily bewte.

And whenever a mon loves to myche his owne hye∣nesse for any of þese ȝiftis, he synnes in pride. And so a proude mon mysusis Gods giftis, when he þonkes not his God mekely for hom.

And so iche proude mon hyes hymself for þat þat he schulde have sorowe, as an ypocrite schulde bisy hymself to large his holynes. But now he dos þo contrarie, for he feynes hym holy by mony fals sygnes; and þis is one condicioun of þo fadir of falshed. And by þis ypocrisye ben mony men desseyved, and specialy by falshed of prelatis and prestis. And falshed is ground of schewyng of þis synne; ffor iche holy mon hafs holynes of God to profit to his neghtbore by þe wey of treuthe, and not for to gab to hym veynly by his falshed.

And þus synnen men of craftis of honde; for wiþ what craft þat a mon may most wynne richesse, þat gladlyest he uses, and leves Gods science. Bot science of God is most nedeful, sith iche mon mot nede serve his God; and science of God techis Gods wille.

And so, if men traveilen wel here in þis service, þei ben more disposid to con hit in heven. And ȝitte þese wrecchid craftis, for þei ben more wynnyng, maken men more proude in hit and in araye. But men þat schulden be professoures of science of God synnen many weies aboute þis science.

oure batil is leveful; or elles wil hit sue þat in alle þis world, men occupyen hor lordschips by unjust titil, and so schulde iche mon feght wiþ his broþer for defaut of titil. Lord, siþ Crist approved þese knyghttis, and bad his apostils selle hor cootis and bye hom swerdis,—wharto bot to feght? and of dedes and wordes of Crist is feghtyng approved, why is hit not leveful? Bot here we answeren aftir þo first sentence, þat werres and feghtynges ben now unleveful. And to þo first resoun we answeren on þis wyse; þat name of þo worlde þat þo fende hafs hyed is a grete evydense þat batil is cursed. Ffor mony men ben preysid now for fendes werkes, and honour and worschip þat þo world gyves hom is comynly for vicis and not for vir∣tues; ffor worldly men tellen more by vicis þen by virtues. Lord, what honour falles to a knyght, for he killes mony men? Wil I wot þat honge-men killen mony moo, and by more just titel, and so by vertue, and so schulden þei be preysid more þen soche knyȝtis. And bochere of bestis dos oft tyme his offis by right and by charite, and so he dos hit wil; bot bocher of his breþer by not so gret evydense slees men in charite, and so not so justly. Why schulde not þis bocher, for his better dede, be preysid more þen þis knyȝt þat þo world hyees? sith more virtuous dede is more for to pryse. And so hit were better to mon to be bocher of bestis þen to be bocher of his breþer, for þat is more unkyndely. Þo passioun of Crist is myche for to preyse, bot sleeyng of his tormentoures is odiouse to God.

<P>As to titil of conquest, we schulde undirstonde þat if God <NOTE PLACE="marg">Title by con∣quest ex∣amined.</NOTE> bid conquest, hit may þen be leveful,—as childer of Israel had justly hor rewme.

Bot hit is likly þat mony conquerours faylen in tyme of grace in mony of þese. Bot one þing I wot wil by lore of God's lawe, þat if a mon occupye a lordschip unjustly, and his eyr aftir hym be a just mon, God þat is cheeff Lord approves his lordschip; ffor gift of God is best titel, ȝe, better þen heritage. And so just lif of eyres schulde clere hor conscience. And þus schulde no mon feght wiþ oþer by titel of conquest, bot if God bad hym.

And herfore seis þo Gospel, þat þo fende aspyes wheþer servauntes of a monnis house ben ydel and proude, and if he fynde þat hit be so, he dwellis wiþ þat mon. Lord, if a gode housebonde wil not his hyne be ydel, myche more of God, þat lufs clene travel. And þus we reden of aungels, þat nowþer nyȝt ne day þei ben ydel in God's ser∣vise, but blisfuly serven hym. Mon in state of innocense schulde be kept fro ydelnesse, ffor, as Gods lawe seis, he schulde have kept Paradis; and myche more in state of synne schulde mon wake in Gods servise. Ffor þo fende is a theff to wake on mon bothe day and nyȝt; and if he se hym nappe or ydel, he temptis hym to monnis harme. If he slepe in Gods servise þo theff spoylis fro a mon godes þat God hafs gyven hym, to helpe hym fro þo fende. If mon wake in ydelnesse, þo fende aspyes þat þen is tyme to tempt mon to serve hym, for þen he þenkes to spede his cause. As, if a mon have to a lord any cause for to spede, he chesis a tyme when þo lord is ydel for to here hym. And so þo fend aspyes tyme when mon leves to serve God, and þen he moves to serve hym, in lustful servise of þo flesche, or in servise of þo world, and putt byhynde Gods servise.

Ffor ho is oure modir þat we schulden most luf, and for hir dyed Crist, as oure byleve techis us. Bot ho is most worschippid by prechyng of Gods worde, and so þis is þo most servise þat prestis schulden do to God. And þus a wommon seide to Crist þat þo wombe þat bare hym and þo teetis þat he sook schulden be blessid of God; bot Crist answerid þat rather schulden þoo men be blessid, þat heren Gods worde and kepen hit in lyvyng. And þis schulden prechoures do more þen oþer men, ffor þei schulden here þo worde of God þat schulde speke in hom, and þis worde schulden þei kepe more þen oþer tresoure. And ydelnesse in þis office hyndris most þo Chirche, and gendres moste þo fendes childer, and sendes hom to his court. Also þo servise is better þat haves a worse contrarie; bot contrarie of prechyng is worste of alle oþer; and herfore prechyng is þo best, if hit be wil done. And herfore Jesus Crist, when he steyghe to heven, enjoyned specialy to alle his apostils to preche þo gospel frely to iche mon. And also when Crist spake last wiþ Petir, he bad hym thryes upon his love for to fede his schepe; and þis wolde not a wise hirde do bot if he loved hit wel, ffor þo office of gostly herde stondes in þis. And, for þo bischops of þo temple tellid Crist to do þis dede, þerfore Crist tolde hom þat at þo day of dome Sodom and Gomor schulden better fare þen þei; for lettyng of gostly seed, siþ þat hit is better, is worse þen þo spillyng of bodily seed. And þus if oure bischopis prechen not in hor persone, bot letten trew prestis to preche to hor schepe, þei ben in þo synne of bischopis þat kilden Jesus. Praying is gode, but not so gode as prechyng; ffor no prest wot, þat dwelles wiþ us, wheþer his preyer be better þen preyer of þo puple.

And alþof gentil men schulden costilyere fare þen prestis, þei ben not excusid fro þo synne of glotorye. Ffor he þat wil kepe hym fro drenchyng of water, kepe hym fro þe brynke for to be siker. Soth hit is þat lordes schulden reule by drede and powere, and so þei schulden be costily in fode and in clothyng. Bot þei may passe resoun by pride of hor state; and herof comen mony perels by wey of suche glotorie; and þus þei rennen in dette, and wasten hor godes; and aftir þei pillen hor tenauntis, and distourblen rewmes, and so þei ben worse þen theves by cause of þis glotorye. For soth hit is þat grete cause of stryffe in þo puple is unjust partyng of worldly richesse. Þo puple is childische, and takes more hede to suche þing þen þei done to virtues or richessis of þo soule, ffor gostily þingis þei seen not, and knowen hom to litil. Lordes by suche glotorye fallen offt in sikenesse, and so ben deede or hor tyme, by hor owne hondes. Ffor, as clerkes seyn comynly, glotorie slees mo men

þen dos swerde. And on þis wyse glotouns ben mon-sleers; and when þei loven homself so litil, no wonder þof þei sleen hor brether. Glotorye distourblis lordis to have hor hoole wittes. Ffor when þo body is undisposid, hit serves not wil þo soule; and þen þei reulen amysse homself and þo peeple undir hom. And of þis springes lecchorye, and mony synnes aftir hit; and þus þo fende by one synne bringes a mon to mony. And þus fro þo brinke ben mony led into þo grete see, and þere ben þei drenchid.</P>
<P>And lustis and defaute of reule is cause of þis synne. For mon schulde wil witte, þat ofte comyne meetis ben more holsum to men þen ben þese riche meetis wiþ hoot spices, and oft tymes comyne drinkes dos more gode þen þese hye drinkes, made costily by crafftis. And þus mony men supposen þat God hafs gyven to reumes bothe meete and drink þat is most acordyng to hom. So if þo reume of Englond were reulid wil by resoun, þing þat comes forth in þo lond wolde suffis hit to meete and drinke. Bot wil I wot þat God hafs ordeyned one lond to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">interchange of products be∣tween different countries is good.</NOTE> plentyuous in one maner of þing, and one in anoþer, ffor cause þat þei schulden comyne in charite. Bot þis is to myche lefft by werris and covetise; for mony men byen wyne for lustis and for wynnyng. For alþof wyne be nedeful for lordes and sacra∣mentis, nereþoles God Almyghty askes þing in mesure. And so mony drinken wyne þat were better lif wiþ ale. We schulden trist and knowe of oure gode God, þat he wil þat his servauntis have gode mete and drinke, to remounte hom in hor body, and herby serve hym better; bot in al þinge he askes mesure, as God is in al þinge. And þus, by ensaumple of glotorye of lordes, apis þat ben lesse þen þei synnen mony weys, when þei ben to costily and to lustily in fode.

Hom þenke hit is a grete avaunt to spende myche in household, and make grete festis to lordes; and herof comes myche yvel; ffor by þis ben parties made, and mony wrongis mayntened. Ffor þo synne of covetise bringis in þo synne of glotorye. And not onely riche comyns synnen þus in glotorye, bot mony pore laboreres ben blemyschid by þis synne, and specialy in dronk∣enesse, for uneven norisching. Ffor now þei hungren and thristen, and þerwiþ travelen fast, and now þei comen to meete and drinke, and taken to myche þerof; and soche mot nede passe mesure, as swyne eten hor meete. Þis we seyn, for soche men schulden warly ete and drinke, and take sum drinke on werk day, and not spende al on holy day; ffor þis þing unables hom to serve God on holy day, and makes hom to feght as wode men, ȝe, more þen beestis done, ffor beestis kepen more mesure in etyng and drinkyng.</P>
<P>Hit were to long to telle þo harmes þat comen of dronkenesse, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Evils of drunk∣enness.</NOTE> ffor soche men, as beestis, serven þen not Crist,—ffor Crist is wisedome of þo Fader,—and þei faylen þen in resoun, and ben þen as hors and mule þat wanten undirstondyng. Lord, sith hit is schameful to be in state of a beeste, myche more schulde hit be to passe beeste in foly; and so done þes dronken men for tyme þat þei ben dronken. A mon schulde not by resoun, to wynne al þis worlde, ne to wynne þo blis of heven, chese to lese his witte; for þen hit did hym no gode, lordschip ne blis of heven; as men seen þat beestis coveyten not monnis lordschip. Bot siþ men fallen by dronkenesse fro resoun worse þen beestis, who schulde not by pure skile fle to be dronken? And by þis skile al synne schulde algatis be fled, for synne makes a mon noght in þat þat he is synful. Ffor ȝitt a mon is sum þing in þat þat he is myche or litil, and so in þat þat he is whit <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI REND="italic">witty,</HI> BB.</NOTE>, slep∣ynge, or restynge; bot no mon is oght worthe in þat þat he synnes.

If gode cum of synne hit is a grace of God, and men schulden not putt hom in þis caas to wynne al þis worlde, ffor in þis þei tempten God, and witten not wheþer his right∣wisenes wil profyte mercyfuly to mon when he synnes þus. And if þou sey, mon fallyng in dronkenesse ryses sone þerof, and better is disposid for to do his werk, or what þat he schulde do, here þou spekes as a foole, as alle proctoures of synne. For þou woste nevere wheþer þou schalt dye in tyme of þi dronkenesse, and nere make asethe to God for synne þat þou fallis inne. Bot Gods lawe techis us to lyve evere in þat state þat we be redy to hym, what tyme þat he calles us. And amonge oþer causes, herfore haves God ordeyned þat tyme of deth be uncerteyne to men þat dwellen here in erthe, ffor we schulden evere be redy whenevere God calles us to ende in his servise, and take of him þo blis of heven. Mony soche blynde∣nessis colouren mennis synne and maken hom Gods foolis, for iche synne comes of folye. If þo worlde holde men foolis for þo luf of Crist, hit is a gode token in men þat lyve wel, for we schulden take as bileve þat mon when he synnes dos hym harme, to body and to soule, to þis lif and to þat oþer.</P>

And herfore men þat knowen hor dedis seyn þat þei synnen here mony gatis, sith more grevos avoutrie þei chargen to litel, and he þat is untrew in more reckes litel to be fals in lesse. Ffor prestis ben weddid wiþ God by holdyng of his lawe, and þis bond is dissolvyd bothe in lif and offis. For þei schulden lif on Gods part, and preche trewly þo gospel, bot bothe þese have prestis schamefuly forsaken, and ben weddid wiþ þo contrarie to hor lyves ende. And so þei have taken Anticrist and forsaken Crist, and more foule devorse was nevere none made. Hor bodily lecchorye cryes in þo Chirche bothe prively and apertly, by holdyng of hor lemmons and by getyng of hor childer, as þei were weddid men. Lord, sith Seynt Poule wolde nevere ete flesche bifore he sclaundrid his brother, hou may prestis for schame synne comynly wiþ wymmen, ȝe, þat schulden be hor childer! Ouþer Gods lawe is fals and þo popes lawe bothe, or þese men schulden be prived of almes of þo puple.

Lord, who wolde not despise þis, þat mouthe and hondes of þis prest þat makes and tretis Gods body schulden be polute wiþ a hoore! And if he abstyne hym fro masse, and resseyve þo sacrament, sith he resseyves hit gostly wiþ an unclene bileve, he dos more despit to Gods body þen if he caste hit in þo lake; for synne is more unclene to God þen any bodily filþ. And þus þo prest brekes his vow, ouþer prive or apert, sith he vowed to serve God at tyme þat he toke þis state, to lif þo lyve þat fel to a prest, and clenly do his offis. And sith þat gostly sacrilegie is fals takyng of holy gode, hym semes to synne in sacrilegie when he withdrawes his holy service, and so he serves in myche more to be hangid þen a theff. And as hangyng in helle is more grevous þen hangyng here, so punysching of God is more grevous þen monnis punyschyng. And so, sith place agreggis synne, as comynate of men schulde wil knowe, so holy state agreggis synne in prestis þat synnen þus. As hit is more grevous synne to do lecchorie in holy Chirche þen in oþer unholy placis, so hit is of synne of prestis. And þus þese traytoures don despit to God þat þei schulden most serve; and þei desseyven þus þo puple, þat þei schulden serve in helpe of soule.

<HEADNOTE><P>[The only known copy of the following tract is in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS. 296 (for a description of the manuscript, see the Introduction to this volume). It is not mentioned even by Bale, and the only reason for ascribing it to Wyclif is that it is found in a volume which Archbishop Parker, in the sixteenth century, believed to contain only tracts of Wyclif's composition, and under that belief bequeathed to the college. St. Augustine's being called here 'Seynt Austyn,' instead of simply 'Austyn,' as in the Homilies, appears a suspicious circumstance, yet capable perhaps of explanation, if we suppose the tract to have been composed by Wyclif in his younger days. But, whatever may be thought of its authenticity, it possesses sufficient intrinsic interest to justify its appearing, for the first time, in print.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEADNOTE><P>[This tract, with the Latin title as given above, is mentioned in Bale's list of Wyclif's writings. The text is based on a careful transcript from C. C. C.

<HEADNOTE><P>[Of this tract, in English, there is only one known MS., that at New College, Oxford, (Q in the present edition). But there is a Latin version of it among the Wyclif MSS. at Vienna,—a fact which forms the principal ground for ascribing it to our author. Its position in the New College MS., between the 'Letter to Urban,' and the 'Letter on the Love of God,'—pieces of undoubted authenticity,—is also pretty good proof that the com∣piler of that MS. considered it to be from the hand of Wyclif. There is no sure indication of date; but from the absence of allusion to certain favourite topics of the reformer's last years, such as the doctrine of the Eucharist and the papal schism, I am inclined to infer that it is a comparatively early production.

<HEADNOTE><P>[This curious tract was overlooked by Dr. Shirley; nor is it mentioned by Bale or Leland; nor do Lewis or Dr. Vaughan appear to have seen it. The only existing copy, so far as appears, is found in the MS., Bodl. 647, between the <HI REND="italic">Vita Sacerdotum</HI> (Shirley, No. 53) and <HI REND="italic">Of the Eucharist</HI> (Shirley, No. 54). From this MS. of course the text is transcribed. The occasion of writing seems to have been the imprisonment of some of the poor priests, which may not improbably have taken place under the letters patent of Richard II, granted to the Archbishop after the Council of London in July, 1382. (See Lewis' <HI REND="italic">Life of Wycliffe,</HI> App. No. 22.) The date of the tract therefore I should be inclined to fix somewhere about the end of 1382. Its position in the MS., between two tracts, the authenticity of one of which is beyond dispute, while the other has at least the authority of Bale, not to speak of internal evidence, in its favour, tends to make it probable that Wyclif was the author; at the same time, it cannot be denied that it con∣tains nothing which might not equally well have been written by one of his followers, as Herford, or Repyndon, or Aston.]</P></HEADNOTE>

Though the founder of a flourishing branch of the Benedictine order, he never was more than a deacon. Does the writer mean to say that St. Maur preserved, after he joined St. Benedict, his secular rank and status as a nobleman? or merely that he and his fellows as they were the first monks in the West, so had never been equalled since?

<HEADNOTE><P>[Bale names this tract under the title 'De Vita Sacerdotum;' but in the only MS. known to exist it is headed 'Vita Sacerdotum.' The MS. in question is Bodl. 647. The manner in which the Council of London is referred to at the opening of the tract seems to show that it was written within a few months after that event; that is, in 1382, or early in 1383. Although Wyclif was at this time disabled by paralysis from active par∣ticipation in the movement which the Council was designed to repress, there is no reason why we should not believe him to have sent, as in this tract, from his retirement at Lutterworth, words of encouragement and counsel to the partisans of reform. The aim of the treatise is to advocate the gradual resumption of all lands and temporal dignities held by the clergy, and their restoration to the state of poverty taught and practised by Christ and his apostles. It is in fact a re-assertion, more or less, of six out of the fourteen conclusions condemned as erroneous by the Council of London.]</P></HEADNOTE>

But suppose þat þei wer vikers of Petir, ȝit þer is anoþer þing þat þei schulde fulfille, þat in byndynge and losynge þei beþ conformed to Crist, ffor ellis þei makiþ a false knotte, and falselyche semeþ to loose. And herfore is nede to hem to have þe keye of science, þat þei kunne bynde and lose aftir þe Chirche above; ffor ellis þei gabbe on hem silf, and doiþ noȝt as þei seyen. Her mayst þou se, how popes and oþere prelatis mut argue in þis wise; what evere Petir byndiþ or losiþ, or ellis his verrey viker, is þus bounde or losid of God in þe Chirche of hevene; but þis pope or þis prelat is verrey Petris viker, and byndiþ or losiþ by þe keye of Goddis kun∣nynge; þerfore it is bounde in hevene or losed, as he seiþ.

<P>Here grucchiþ Antecrist, and seiþ þat by þis skyle þe pope <NOTE PLACE="marg">Answer to an objection made by the de∣fenders of the ordinary view of absolution.</NOTE> hadde no power to certifie men confessid of him, þat þei beþ assoylled of Crist, for he kan nouȝt teche þis, and so schulde perriche Petris keyes, groundid in Cristis graunte. And her∣fore men seyen comunly, þat whom so ony prest assoyliþ, he is assoyled of God by vertu of þe keyes. Ne men schulle suffre no more penaunce þan þe prest enjoyneþ hem, ffor God haþ ȝeve þe prest power to deme aftir his owne wille, ffor ellis it were a needeles þing to schryve men þus to prestis. As anentis þis, me þinkiþ þat men schulde trowe þat þei beþ nouȝt assoyllid ne bounde of her synne, but in as myche as God him silf doiþ it. For siþ God is lord of alle, agens whom is synne i-do, ȝif ony man synneþ aȝens ony creature, þis lord mut ffirst for∣ȝeve his wreþe; and hit wer as unsemelyche man to forȝeve þe wreþe of God, as ȝif þe werst boy in þis rewme forȝaf þe kyngis wreþe, and specially siþ God is more overe þe pope and eche prelat her, þanne þe kynge of Ingelond is more þanne a boy; and God is neiȝe to ech soule more þanne ony man may be. And graunte in presence of þis lord, wiþouten his autorite, [of <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">supplied conjecturally.</NOTE>] trespace don unto him, were a foul presumpcioun. And so prestis be but servauntis to telle þe wille of God, þat God forȝeveþ þe synne, ȝif þat men beþ worþi. And þis knowynge schulde prestis have, and knowe Goddis mercy, þat ȝif men make aseeþ to God, God wole þanne assoyle hem. And errour
<PB N="254" REF="277" MS="y"/>
in þis bileve disceyveþ many men. And herby may we se,—as power ȝeve to servauntis, is noȝt wittily ȝeve, but ȝif þei kunne here office, so God geveþ noȝt to men power for to assoyle, but ȝif he ȝeve hem kunnynge þat falliþ to her office. And so it may be ofte tymes, þat prelates feyneþ hem power, al ȝif þei have no such power, ffor þei beþ unable. And siþ God mute graunte þis power as propre to him silf, and he may noȝt erre in knowynge of unable prestis, herfore men may be disceyved in hope of suche power; and herfore men schulde telle þe peple of þis power of God, and teche men to affye in þis, and noȝt in mennes power.</P>
<P>But wel I woot þat þis bileve wynneþ noȝt us þe peny, ne <NOTE PLACE="marg">The true doctrine is not a lucrative one, but must not therefore be abandoned.</NOTE> makiþ us noȝt to be worschipid, ne þe peple soget to us; but pupplischinge of Goddis lawe schulde noȝt be lefte herfore. Bi þis may men se answere to þis resoun,—þat no pope here in erþe, but ȝif he have revelacioun, can telle men þat þei beþ as∣soylled of synne þat þei beþ schryven of, siþe he can noȝt telle þat men haveþ contricioun. And as þe popis lawe seiþ, in grauntynge of his pryvylegie he grauntiþ noȝt suche indulgence but to contrit and confessid. Ȝe, ȝif þe pope seie contrarie, or freris, or seyntis in hevene, men schulde noȝt trowe to hem in þis, siþe þei seie byside þe feiþ. And siþ no confessour in erþe kan wyte where men be contrit, but suppose bi her owne wordis þat þei seye soþe in þis, hit is open þat þes confessours wyttiþ ne bileveþ þat her confessid beþ contrit, but liȝtly sup∣pose þat þei seie soþe of hem silf, and bi þis þei suppose þat God him silf assoyliþ hem, and þanne beþ þei wel assoyled. And þei beþ Goddis bedels to telle truly his sentence, and oþir wise may þei noȝt assoyle men of here synne. And siþ þe pope seiþ þat he assoyleþ ech confessid and contrit, in þat þat he seiþ þat men beþ confessid and contrit, hit semeþ þat þe pope pre∣sumeþ to seie þat þes men haveþ contrycioun. And certis þes popis or cardinals can noȝt wyte of hem silf, wheþer þei have contrycioun, but by a liȝt hope, siþe þei knowe noȝt diference bytwixe attricioun and sufficiant contricioun <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The reader of Pascal and of Boileau will here be reminded of the famous controversy concerning attrition and contrition which shook the Church of France in the seven∣teenth century, the Jesuits contend∣ing that <HI REND="italic">attrition,</HI> that is, sorrow for sin out of a motive of fear, to∣gether with the sacrament of pe∣nance, was sufficient to cleanse men's souls and make them fit for heaven, while the other side urged that <HI REND="italic">contrition,</HI> or sorrow for sin out of a motive of the love of God, was indispensable. He will remember that terrible sarcasm of Boileau, who makes the Almighty invite the de∣fender of the sufficiency of attrition into Paradise, with the words—

And so sum men þenkiþ, þat al þis sacrament is noȝt fully groundid in al holy wryt but in general wordis, and special beþ unknowen; and herfore men schulde noȝt graunte special þat þei knowe noȝt. And her may men se þat Petris keyes schulde noȝt perriche, but be furbusched and clensid of þe rust of heresie, and blasphemye of confessouris schulde be leyd adoun, and þis were profyt to our Chirche and hatynge of blasfeme con∣fessours.

And so þis confessioun þat is maad to man, haþ ofte tyme be varied in varyinge of þe Chirche. For first men confessid to God and to þe comun peple, and þis confessioun was used in tyme of apostlis.

Þe harme þat comeþ of þis schrifte is ful gret in þe Chirche; ffor many prestis, boþe more and lasse, blasfemeþ in here power, and failliþ in þe keye of kunnynge in þis feyned absolucioun, and falliþ in heresie, prestis and her sogettis, but ȝif prestis purge þe keye of here kunnynge, and stondiþ in boundis of bileve.

And herfore bookis seyen þat penaunce is arbitrarie, now more and now lasse, after þat prestis lykyn. So ofte tyme sum prestis for þe lasse synne enjoyneþ more penaunce, and sum for þe more synne lasse penaunce; but how evere þei en∣joyneþ, God þe hiȝe juge, agenst whom men synneþ, taxeþ evene þe penaunce, þat prestis knowiþ nouȝt, as þei knowiþ noȝt grevousnes of synne.

And certis no synne is forȝeve but bi good will of God; and so prestis may telle þe peple, as servauntis or bedels, þat men han þe good wille of God ȝif þei don on þis wise. And þis office haþ God ȝeve prestis ffor þei schulde be more wise, and noȝt to boste ne to lye on þe will of God; but riȝt as prestis of þe oolde lawe hadde power and kunnynge to telle ho wer leprous and ho were clene of lepre, bi sygnes þat God tauȝte hem, so in þe newe lawe haþ God tauȝte his prestis by what spiritual sygnes þei schulde knowe goostly lepre, and bi what sygne þei schulde seie þis lepre is forȝeve, ȝif þe man confessid to prestis seie soþ of himsilf.

But ȝif Crist wolde þat þei schulde fiȝte wiþ swerdis, þat þei schulde þus bigge, hit were wondir whi he blamed Petir, ffor he fauȝt wiþ Malcus.

Also doinge of Crist is beste and liȝtteste þat men can divyse; but Crist myȝte liȝtly have vencushid his enemyes by word or bi aungels, alȝif he hadde noȝt woundid hem; ffor Crist hadde many lygiouns of aungels at his biddinge, and whanne Crist seide þis schort word, his enemyes wenten aback and fell to þe erþe.

<HEAD>XXII. THE GRETE SENTENCE OF CURS EXPOUNED.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[The following pamphlet, of which a complete analysis is given by Dr. Vaughan in his <HI REND="italic">Tracts and Treatises of Wycliffe,</HI> and of which Lewis also, in his Life of the reformer, made considerable use, is known to exist in one MS. only, the Corpus volume at Cambridge, so often referred to. The text of this volume is not in a good state, having been evidently writ∣ten by a careless scribe; of this the frequent conjectural emendations at foot of the page will supply evidence. The text as here given to the reader is founded on a transcript made at Cambridge, which my friend Mr. W. A. Wright has been good enough to examine with the MS. before sending it to me. This transcript I have again compared with a transcript made for Lewis about a century and a half ago, and now among the Rawlinsonian MSS. in the Bodleian Library.</P>
<P>With regard to authenticity, it seems to me impossible to come to any certain conclusion. The treatise does not occur in Bale's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue,</HI> nor is it ascribed to Wyclif by any early writer; in fact, there is no external evi∣dence whatever in support of its having been written by Wyclif beyond the circumstance of its being found in the Corpus volume. The internal evidence, so far as date goes, is satisfactory enough. The Council of London is referred to in ch. xix, as having recently taken place, and in ch. xxv Bishop Spencer's war in Flanders seems to be spoken of as actually going on; this would fix the date of composition to 1383, about a year before Wyclif's death. With regard to the style, opinions may differ; but it does not seem to me to be precisely that of Wyclif, but more appropriate to some fiery follower of his, who had reached a point of intense exaspera∣tion not exhibited in the undoubted works of Wyclif.</P>
<P>The author's choice of subject, and the title of the work, have great light thrown upon them by a document printed by Mr. Maskell <HI REND="italic">(Monum. Ritual. Eccl. Angl.,</HI> vol. ii. p. 286) from an early printed copy of the <HI REND="italic">Sarum Manual</HI> in the Bodleian Library. The heading of this document is—'Isti sunt generales articuli <HI REND="italic">majoris excommunicationis</HI> in lingua materna, et dicantur

<P>'Godemen and wymmen, it is ordeyned by the counseil of all holi Chirche: First of our holy fader the pope of Rome, and his cardinalis, and all his coun∣seil, sithen of alle archebisshopes and all the clergie, that every man of holy Chirche that hath soule for to kepe, sholde shewe among them foure sithe bi yere, the articles that ben writen in the general sentence, that is for to seyn, the pointes that longen to the great curs; that on is the fyrst Sonday of Advent, that other is the first Sonday of Lenten, and the nexte Sonday after Witsonday, and the first Sonday after the Assumpcyon of our Lady.'</P>
<P>The document proceeds to explain for the information of the laity the terrible effects, here and hereafter, of church cursing, especially of the 'great curse,' which is now in question. The next clause which our pam∣phlet refers to runs as follows:—</P>
<P>'So that first and formest, we denounce acurse, all tho that holy Chirche folsli depriven of any right or profyt, either by law writen, or elles by good custom which hath ben holden and used of old tyme: and in this poynt falleth iii manner of folk: first all tho that steleth holy Chirche goodes in what place so they ben don for to kepe: or elles that stele unhalowed thynges out of holy place, or thinges that ben halowed out of place unhalowed, and all tho that wytyngly breke and destroye any poynt of fredom that longeth to holy Chirche: and this is nought all onely understand of the fredomes that longen generaly to all holy Chirche, but also of other special fredomes, which that some chirche hath more one than another.'—Capp. ii, xxiv, 'Grete sentence, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Two clauses follow (relating to church courts and assault on persons belonging to the clerical order), which are not specially referred to; then comes:—</P>
<P>'Also we denounce all tho acursed, that maliciousli stele or destroye the goodes, that longeth to manere, or to graunges of any men or women of reli∣gion, or of archebisshop, of bisshop, other of any other place of mennes of holy Chirche, wythout special leve of them that have the goodes to kepe.'—Cap. xix.</P>
<P>Several clauses follow, designed for the protection of the persons and property of the clergy, which the pamphleteer does not notice; then comes:—</P>
<P>'Also all tho ben acursed by al holy Chirche that breke or destorb the unite and the pes: first of our lorde the kyng, and sythen of his kynne, by power, or by counseil, by word or by werk: or elles by any way to herte or to compace hys deth, or any point of traytourie of hym or of his lond: and all tho that falsly withholde his heretayge or any other ryght, that hym ought lawfully to have: and all tho ben acursed, that geve mede, or elles take any manere geftes for to lette pes, and for to procure strif in any degre, other more or lasse, among Cristene folk.'—Cap. x.</P>

<P>Of the numerous clauses relating to the important subject of tithe, the following is the only one which the pamphleteer directly notices:—</P>
<P>'And that Crystene men and women be hard bounden on peyne of dedly synne nought alle onely be the ordenaunce of man, but first and formest be the ordenaunce and the commaundament of all myghty God them selfe, but in the olde lawe and also in the newe, for to paye trewly to God and holy Chirche, the tenthe part of all maner of thinges that them have by yere; also wel the tenthe part of all maner encrese, that they winne trewly by the grace of God, both with here travaille and also with here craftes; also the tenthe part of al maner of fysshes and foules and bestes bothe wild and tame, and of al manere frutes that growe out of the erthe, wytnessed wel Seynt Austyn in hys decret, as it is wryten in the lawe of holy Chirche.

<P>But the version of the Great Curse from which these extracts are taken is confessedly an incomplete one; for at the end of the next clause occur the words—'and many other poyntes also longe unto this greate sentence.'

Þerfore þe Chirchis lawe witnessiþ, þat ȝif a man come to benefice bi symonye, ȝe, don bi his frend, hym unwyttynge, he mot resigne it, and ellis he may not be savyd. For, as Crist seiþ, he is a nyȝt þef and a day þef; and a þef may do no verrey penaunce, but ȝif he restore þat þing þat he haþ takyn awey, as Seynt Austyn seiþ; namely, ȝif he be of power þerto. And þis symonyent is of power to resigne; and þerfore he mote nedis resigne his benefice wilfully and frely, wiþouten desiryng to have it aȝen, as Seynt Richard of Armawȝ techiþ. For bi rigour of þe lawe he schulde be degradid, for þe blasphemye þat he dide to God in sillyng þe Holy Gost, as moche as was in hym.

Þerfore Moyses and þe holy prophete Jeremye, halewid in his moder wombe, excusiden hem mekely whanne God badde hem take þe ledyng and governyng of þe peple; and þe holy prophete Ysaye durst not take þis offis at Goddis profer, til he was clensed fro synne bi angelis mynystracion, and enflawmed wiþ Goddis science and charite.

To Westminster Abbey the right was conceded, ac∣cording to Stow, the historian of London, by an express charter of Edward the Confessor; but Wid∣more doubts the authenticity of this charter, and considers that the pri∣vilege probably followed soon upon, and as a consequence of, the canoni∣zation of King Edward. High and low sought and benefited by the privilege; amongst others, Eliza∣beth, queen of Edward IV, first in 1470, and again in 1483, and the poet Skelton, who died in sanctuary in 1529.</P>
<P>The story of the sanctuary at St. John's collegiate church of Beverley is like a golden thread of romance running down through the dim records of six hundred years. The common belief about this famous foundation (originally the work of St. John of Beverley early in the eighth century, but afterwards de∣stroyed by the Danes),—a belief attested by a charter of Henry V, was, that when King Athelstan, re∣turning victorious from Scotland in the year 925, redeemed by a lavish grant of lands and liberties his knife, which on the march out he had left upon the high altar, he did so in these words, 'As fre make I the, as hert may think or eigh may see.' Or, as it is in a metrical ver∣sion, also given by Dugdale, of the same transaction, which is probably as old as the middle of the thir∣teenth century,—</P>
<Q><L>'Swa mikel fredom give I ye,</L>

<P>This church of Beverley, however, was not exempted from the ordinary jurisdiction of the Archbishop of York; rather it was he who exer∣cised, or superintended the exercise of, the great franchises which it pos∣sessed. The privileged circuit, within which fugitives from secular justice were protected, was called the Leuga, and is described in the Domesday survey. A stone chair, called the <HI REND="italic">Frid-stol,</HI> or stool of peace, stood on the right of the high altar; to this chair those who sought sanctuary repaired, and in it they were seated during the cere∣mony of admission. The form of oath, administered by the arch∣bishop's bailiff to the suppliant, is preserved in one of the Harleian MSS. No. 4292, being a register of persons who sought sanctuary for various crimes in the reigns of Edward IV, Henry VII, and Henry VIII. It ran as follows:—</P>
<P>'Sir, tak hede on your oth. Ye shal be trew and feythful to my lord Archbishop of York, lord off this towne, to the provest of the same, to the chanons of this chirch, and all othir ministers thereof.</P>

<HEADNOTE><P>[Two good texts of the following treatise are extant—one at the end of the volume Bodl. 788, which contains the Sermons; the other in the volume of Wyclif tracts at Trin. Coll., Dublin, marked C. V. 6. The Bodleian MS., which has been transcribed for the present edition, appears, on a comparison with the text of the Dublin MS., as printed by Dr. Todd in his <HI REND="italic">Three Treatises by John Wyclyffe,</HI> to be considerably the more accu∣rate of the two.</P>
<P>The treatise is ascribed to Wyclif in Bale's catalogue under the title 'De Ecclesiae Dominio,' inc. 'Christi ecclesia est ejus sponsa.' It is impossible to say whence he derived this title, which however accu∣rately enough describes the work, or at any rate all the early portion of it. There is no title, but only a descriptive heading, in the Bod∣leian MS. The Dublin MS. gives as the title 'De Ecclesia et Membris ejus.' Perhaps the scribe invented this title, on the hint given him by the descriptive heading in the Bodleian MS.;—perhaps he confounded the present work with the long Latin treatise, <HI REND="italic">De Ecclesia et Membris,</HI> writ∣ten by Wyclif, which is frequently referred to by Walden in his <HI REND="italic">Doctrinale,</HI> and catalogued by Bale with the <HI REND="italic">incipit</HI> 'Suppositis dictis de fide Catho∣licâ.' That Wyclif was the author of the present treatise I see little reason to doubt. The mere fact of its being found in Bodl. 788 is an evidence in its favour, since all the remaining contents of that volume are unquestion∣ably by Wyclif. The style, the mention of 'Caymes castelis' (p. 348, note), the language held respecting the Eucharist in Ch. VI,—all tend to identify Wyclif as the writer.</P>
<P>From the manner in which the expedition to Flanders is spoken of in Ch. V, as an event of the recent past, I should infer that the treatise was written in the early part of the year 1384.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>HERE BIGYNNEÞ A TRETICE ÞAT TELLIÞ KNOWLECHE SUMWHAT OF ÞE CHIRCHE AND HIR MEMBRIS.</HEAD>
<P>CRISTIS Chirche in his Spouse, that haþ þree partis. Þe first <NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's Church is in three parts: The first con∣sists of angels and saints in heaven; the second of saints in pur∣gatory; the third of men that shall be saved, here on earth.</NOTE> part is in blis, wiþ Crist heed of þe Chirche, and conteneþ angels and blessid men þat now ben in hevene. Þe secounde part of þis Chirche ben seintis in purgatorie; and þes synnen not of þe newe, but purgen þer olde synnes. And many errours fallen in preiyng for þes seintis; and siþ þei alle been deed in bodi, Cristis wordis may be taken of hem,—sue we Crist, in oure lif, and late þe dede birie the dede. Þe þridde part of the Chirche ben trewe men þat here lyven, þat schulen be aftir saved in hevene, and lyven here Cristen mennis liif. Þe first part is clepid over-comynge; þe myddil is clepid slepyng; þe þridde is clepid fiȝtinge Chirche; and alle þes maken o Chirche. And heed of þis Chirche is Crist, boþe God and man; and þis Chirche is modir to ech man þat shal be saaf, and conteyneþ no membre but oonli men þat shal be saved. For, as Crist vouchiþ-saaf to clepe þis Chirche his spouse, so he clepiþ curside men fendis, as was Scarioth. And fer be it fro Cristene men to graunte þat Crist haþ weddid þe fend; sith Poul seiþ in oure bileve þat Crist comouneþ not wiþ Belial. And here we takun as bileve þat ech member of holi Churche shal be saved wiþ Crist, as ech membre of þe fend is dampned; and so þe while we fiȝten here and witen not where we schal be saaf, we witen not where we ben membris of holi Churche. But as God wole of þre þingis, þat we knowun hem not in certein, so he wole for greet cause þat we witen not where we ben of þe Chirche. But as ech man shal hope þat he schal be saaf in blisse, so he shulde suppose þat he be lyme of holi Chirche; and þus he shulde love holi Chirche, and worschipe it as his modir.</P>
<P>And by þis hope, bineþe bileve, shulden be two synnes fled; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore no man, not the Pope himself, can tell while he lives whe∣ther he be a member of the Church or not,</NOTE> pride of men and coveitise, bi title þat þei ben men of holi Chirche. For no pope þat now lyveþ woot where he be of þe Chirche, or where he be a lym of the fend, to be dampned wiþ Lucifer.

Ȝif ony man be tauȝt of God þat he shal be saved in hevene, noon or fewe men ben siche; and asaye hem bi hem silf, for þei schulden have noon <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">omitted; CC.</NOTE> evidence to seie þat God haþ told hem þis. Þe first bileve þat we schulden have is, þat Crist is God and man; and how he haþ him bi his Goddhede, and how he lyvede here by his manhede.

<P>But aftir þes two godliche virtues, we taken sumþing as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sketch of the early history of the Church till Pope Sylves∣ter.</NOTE> bileve, and sumþing bi comune croniclis; and hopen þat charite moveþ us here. After that Crist hadde dwelt here long ynowȝ wiþ his apostlis, aboute þree and þritti ȝeer, as him likide, aftir∣ward he was kild of þe Jewes, and aftirward þe þridde day oure God aroos from deþ to lyf. And aftir þe fourtiþe day fro þat he was schewid to his disciplis, Jesus stiede in to hevene, and rengnede ever þere wiþ his Fadir. And so þe first part of þe Chirche rengneþ þus in hevene with Crist; þe secounde part slepiþ ȝit, as longe as Crist likiþ; þe þridde part of þe Chirche fiȝtiþ here aftir Crist, and takiþ ensaumple and weie of him to come to hevene as he cam. And ever more þe Hooli Goost governeþ wiþ hem al Cristis Chirche; for as þes þree persones of God ben o God and not manye, so alle dedes and werkes of þe Trinite mai not be departid from oþir. For as al þat þe Fadir wole, þe Sone wole, and þis Goost wole,—so al þat o per∣sone doiþ, þes þree persones done. Aftir þat Crist was stied in to hevene, aboute ten daies, as he hadde ordeynid, he sente doun þe Holi Goost, and movede apostlis to do his dedes; and þei wenten and prechiden faste among Jewis and heþen men. But Jewis aȝenstonden hem faste, and heþene men token him wiþ wille, and resceyveden þe Holy Goost, and bicamen Cristene men. And þus apostlis of Crist filliden bi Goddis grace þis world. But longe aftir, as croniclis seien, þe fend hadde envie herto; and bi Silvestre preest of Rome he brouȝte in a newe
<PB N="341" REF="364" MS="y"/>
gile, and moved þe emperour of Rome to dowe þis Chirche in þis preest. For, as the fend tauȝte þis kyng, þis dede cam of greet almes; for þei þouȝten not how þe Chirche shulde sue Crist in his lawe. But trewe men supposen here, þat boþe þis emperour and þis preest weren moved of God bi tymes to trowe þat þei synneden in þis dede. But bisie we us not where þei ben seintis, and how þei were þus moved of God; for al þis is byneþe bileve, and men mai trowe it ȝif þei wolen.</P>
<P>Whan þis lif was þus changid, þe name of this preest was <NOTE PLACE="marg">After whom the Papacy was corrupted more and more,</NOTE> changid; he was not clepid Cristis apostle, ne hiȝ disciple of Crist, but he was clepid the pope, and heed of al hooli Chirche; and aftirward camen oþer names bi feynyng of ypocritis; as sum men seien, þat he is even wiþ the manheed of Crist, and hierste viker of Crist to do in erþe whatever him likiþ; and summe florishen oþir names, and seien þat he is moost blissed fadir. But cause herof ben beneficis þat þis preest ȝyveþ to men; for Symon Magus travailide nevere more in symonie þan þes preestis doon. And so God wolde suffre no lenger þe fend to regne oonli in oo siche preest, but, for synne þat þei hadden do, made devisioun amongis two, so þat men myȝten liȝtlier in Cristis name overcome þes boþe. For as o virtu is strengere if it be gedrid, þan if it be scatrid, so o malis is strenger whanne it is gederid in o persone, and it is of lesse strengþe whanne it is departid in manye; for þanne oon helpiþ aȝen anoþir to con∣founde Anticrist.</P>
<P>And þis moveþ pore preestis to speke now herteli in þis <NOTE PLACE="marg">so that the poor priests now speak out boldly and declare the Pope to be Antichrist.</NOTE> mater. For whanne þat God wole helpe his Chirche, and men ben slowe and wole not worche, þis slouþe is to be dampned for many causis in idil men. And myche more ben þei damp∣nable, þat letten Goddis lawe to shyne. Þes men taken noo witnes of adversaries to þis pope, and ben Jewis and Sarasynes, Grekis and Yngdis, wiþ many oþir; but þei taken þe lyf of Crist as bileve, and þeron grounden hem; and þus þei seien, ȝif þis pope contrarieþ to Cristis lyf, he is þe moste fendis viker and Anticrist þat is here; and sich Anticrist and noon oþir þenken many þat Goddis lawe spekiþ of. Bileve telliþ how Joon seide, þat now ben many Anticristis; but ȝif oon is moost of
<PB N="342" REF="365" MS="y"/>
oþir, þat gileþ man bi ypocrisie. For oon mai seie þat he aloone is Cristis viker here in erþe, and he haþ power singuler to taxe gracis as him likiþ, for so dide Petir, aftir Crist, and many oþir after Petir; and þus þer is oon emperour, and oon heed in a comunnete. But here þenken trewe men þat þe fend failliþ here, and goiþ unstable bi two weies, and reversiþ Goddis lawe. First shulde þe fend grounde þat þis pope is Petris viker, and so viker of Crist, in þat þat he sueþ Crist. For bileve techiþ þat þe chesyng maad of man is fals signe, and incompleet for to make Cristis viker; but workis of a mannis lyf shulde make a man sue Crist. And þus Crist biddiþ þe Jewes, þat þei shulden trowe to his werkes; and þus verry Cristis viker shulde be por∣erste man of oþir, and mekerst of oþir men, and moost traveile in Cristis Chirche. But chesyng of cardinalis, and parting of benefices, and takyng of newe names, ben ful fer fro þis staat. Þus lyvede Petir, aftir Crist; and chalengide no siche names, ne to be heed of holi Chirche, but how mekely he myȝte serve it. But ech apostle in his cuntre wrouȝte aftir Cristis lawe, and noon of hem hadde aftir nede to come to Petir to be con∣fermed. But oonhede on heed of holi Chirche is Jesus Crist here wiþ us, þat is ever in þe myddil of þree þat ben gedrid in his name. And þat man is out of resoun, þat trowiþ þat Cle∣ment in Petris tyme was more þan Joon evaungelist, or any apostle that lyvede wiþ him. And ȝif we trowen to croniclis here, hou þat Clement left his office and procuride oþir to helpe him, as Poul helpide Petir, and Petre suffride mekeli þat Poul snybbide him whanne he erride, we mai see opunli how þes popis fallen fro Petir, and myche more þei fallen fro Crist þat myȝte not erre in onyþing. Trowe we þat Crist lefte to preche, and seelde officis of þe Chirche, or wolde juge of unknowun þing to him, or make him more þan he was? Alle þes þingis þat popis doon techen þat þei ben Anticristis; for Crist myȝte not take a name, but ȝif it were mekenes and treuþe.</P>
<P>And ȝif þou seie þat Cristis Chirche mut have an heed here <NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ, not the Pope, is the true and sole head of the Church.</NOTE> in erþe, soiþ it is, for Crist is heed, þat muste be here wiþ his Chirche unto þe day of dome, and everywhere bi his God∣hede. For siþ vertue of a kyng mut be strecchid by al his rewme, myche more þe vertue of Crist is comuned wiþ al his
<PB N="343" REF="366" MS="y"/>
children. And ȝif þou seie þat Crist mut nedis have sich a viker here in erþe, denye þou Cristis power, and make þis fend above Crist. For bileve techiþ us, þat noo man mai grounde þis viker oonly on Cristis lawe, but on presumpcioun of man; and sich hyenesse of emperours haþ destried her empire; and, ȝif þat God wole, þes popes shal destrie hemsilf, ȝhe, here,—for no drede þei ben distried in helle bi jugement of Crist. And so whatever reasoun men maken of Crist, of Petir, or oþer good ground, it goiþ opinli aȝen sich a pope for þe grete diversite; and so whanne þes men failen resoun, þei tristen to mannis helpe, and feynen bi ipocrisie how myche good þei don aȝen.

<P>Here men taken sumwhat soiþ, and doon dremyng to þis <NOTE PLACE="marg">The theory of the high papal party has no foundation in Scripture.</NOTE> treuþe. Þei seien soþli, þat Cristis Chirche is his hous to kepe his meyne;—and summe in þis hous ben sones, þat shulen ever dwelle in hevene and take her fadris heritage, ȝhe, ȝif þei tres∣passen for a tyme,—and summe ben servauntis in þis hous, al ȝif þei shulen aftir be dampned. And so it is greet diversite to be in þis Chirche; and of þis Chirche þes wordis ben soþli seid, and notabli to mannis kynde. But whanne dremes come aftir, þei maken a fals feyned tale. Þei seien,—whanne Crist wente to hevene, his manhed wente in pilgrymage, and made Petir, wiþ al þes popis, his stewardis to reule his hous, and ȝaf hem ful power herto bifore alle oþir preestis alyve. Here þis dreem takun amys turneþ up so doun þe Chirche. For Petir was a trewe help wiþ Poul and Joon and oþir apostlis; but noon of þes servauntis dremeden þat he was heed of hooli Chirche, or þat he lovede Crist more þan ony of his breþren dide. It is licli to many men þat Petir lovede Crist more in a maner þan ony of þes oþir apostlis, but he was tauȝt to strive not herfore; for oþir apostlis in oþir maner loveden more Crist þan dide Petir,—as Poul traveilide more in þe Chirche,—and Joon lovede Crist more hevenliche. For Joones love was in quiet and clene, as seintes loven in heven. Which of þes is more hiȝ now is but foli us to dreme. Wel we witen þat Crist
<PB N="344" REF="367" MS="y"/>
wole taken, of what state þat him likiþ, a man, aftir þat he is worþi, to more blis or more joie; but aftir bileve of hooli writt, þat telliþ of Petre and oþir apostlis þat þei ben now blessid in hevene,—for noon fel but Scarioth,—taken we biside bileve of many oþir, þat þei ben seintis, as of Clement and Laurence, and oþir þat þe Legende <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The <HI REND="italic">Legenda Aurea</HI> of Jacobus de Voragine.</NOTE> spekiþ of. And of summe we han more evidence, and of sum lasse, bineþe bileve.</P>
<P>And summe þenken a greet evidence, þat if þe pope canonise <NOTE PLACE="marg">Canonization no proof of holiness, nor election to the Popedom of election to bliss.</NOTE> þis man, þanne he mut nedis be seint in hevene. But trowe þei þis men þat wolen. Wel Y woot þat þese popis may erre and synne, as Petre dide, and ȝit Petre dremede not þus, to shewe þat men ben seintis in hevene. But it mai falle þat manie men þat ben canonisid by þes popis ben depe dampned in helle, for þei disseyven and ben disseyved. Afferme we not as bileve, þat ȝif a man be chosen pope, þan he is chosen to blis, as he is here clepid blessederste fadir. And many trowen bi þer werkes þat þes ben depperst dampned in helle. For þei chargen hemsilf as ypocritis, boþe in office and in name; and so þei sitten in þe firste place here, and at þe laste day of dome þei schulen be in þe laste place, þat is, þe depperste place of helle. Holde we us in bondis of bileve, þat stondiþ in general wordis and in condicionel wordis, and juge we not here folili. But we mai seie bi supposal, þat we gesse þat it is so; and whoever haþ more evidence, his part shulde sunner be sup∣posid. But here ben þree grete heresies þat disseyven many men. First, men supposen þat ech pope is þe moost blessid fadir; but þis speche lastiþ but a while, til þat þe pope mai avaunce men. But heere we seien soþly, þat þes men þat clepen hem blessid, disseiven hem and flateren hem, for þei hopen to have wynnyng of hem. For wheþir is þis pope moost blessid in þis liif or aftir þis lyf? He is not blessid in þis lif, for blis falliþ to þe toþir lyf, and þis lif is ful of sorowe and synne, þat suffriþ not blis wiþ it. And ȝif men speken largeli, many men ben here more blessid þan þe pope; for hyenes of þis state makiþ not bi himsilf man blessid, for ellis ech pope were blissed, al ȝif he were falsly chosen of fendis; and Scarioth shulde be blissed, for he was chosen of Crist himself. And it is no nede
<PB N="345" REF="368" MS="y"/>
to argue here for to disprove þis foli, for it is more fals in him∣silf þan ouȝt þat men shulen bringe herof.</P>
<P>Þe toþir heresie, þat comeþ of þis, disceyveþ many simple <NOTE PLACE="marg">The notion of papal infalli∣bility is a heresy,</NOTE> men; þat ȝif þe pope determine ouȝt, þanne it is soiþ and to bileve. But Lord! where ech pope be more and beter wiþ God þan was Petre? But he erride ofte, and synnede myche; ȝhe, aftir he hadde take þe Holi Goost. Lord! wher Crist clepide hym Sathanas, and bad him go aftir him, and ȝit þer was no cause of his errour, wherfore Crist clepide him þus? And so whanne Petre denyede Crist, and swore fals for a wom∣mans vois, he erride in þis foul synne; and þerfore he wepte aftir. Also, aftir takyng of þe Holi Goost, Petre erride, as Poul seiþ, whanne he wolde not dele with Gentiles for tendir∣nesse of þe Jewis. Lord! wher men of worse liif mai sunner erre in þer jugement! And ever þe moo þat ben of siche, ever þe sunner mai þei erre; for Scarioth made oþir apostlis to erre in companye of Crist, and it were to fals a feynyng, to seie þat holi Chirche hangiþ on þes, for þis feyner can not teche þat ony of þes is of þe Chirche. And of þis comen many heresies, <NOTE PLACE="marg">with other opinions con∣nected with it.</NOTE> as of assoilingis and indulgencis, and cursingis, wiþ feyned par∣dons, þat make many men have conscience and trowe more to þe pope in sich a cause þan þei trowe to þe Gospel. And men moten erre here in bileve, and take ofte fals as bileve. Þis heresie schulden men flee, for fals mainteynyng makiþ heretikes, and to assente wiþ suche falseheed bringiþ in ofte heresies; and Crist wole not assente wiþ þes, for þei mai not be soiþ.</P>

It is licly þat Cristis preestis, þat stooden til þat monkes comen, turneden to myche fro Cristis lawe, and monkes lyve∣den þan wel beter. But þes monkes stoden awhile, and turne∣den souner to coveitise; and aftir monkes camen þes chanouns; and after chanouns camen freris. And so greet defaute was in prestis bifore, þat þes newe ordris camen in.

in Goddis office fro þat þat Crist bad his preestis do. So, ȝif apostlis weren now alyve, and sawen þus preestis serve in þe Chirche, þei wolden not clepe hem Cristis officeris, but officeris of Anticrist. Suppose we þat þes newe ordris, stondinge alle þes olde ordris, ben chargious to þe Chirche in worldli goodis þat þei dispenden. For noumbre of preestis brouȝt in bi Crist was sufficient for Cristis hous, and for þe same hous ben now moo and worse; and þis hous is lesse by hem. Who mai denye þat ne þis noumbre of þes officeris is now to myche? And so þis stiward haþ chargid þis hous wiþ newe rehetours <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Several explanations have been proposed of this word, the general sense of which clearly is 'servants,' 'menials.' But since <HI REND="italic">rehete</HI> and <HI REND="italic">re∣hetinge,</HI> in the sense of 'refresh,' are of frequent occurrence in Chaucer, the proposal of Dr. Todd to con∣sider <HI REND="italic">rehetours</HI> a noun of the agent formed from <HI REND="italic">rehete,</HI> and to derive it from the old French word <HI REND="italic">rehaiter, rehetier,</HI> seems to me preferable to the ingenious solutions proposed by writers in 'Notes and Queries.' <HI REND="italic">Hait</HI> meant enjoyment, <HI REND="italic">haiter</HI> to enjoy one∣self; therefore <HI REND="italic">rehetours</HI> might mean lazy apolaustic fellows, idlers, super∣numeraries with little or no work to do,—a class which in those days of 'maintenance' infested, as we know, the great country houses and castles of the nobility. See Todd's <HI REND="italic">Three Treatises by Wycliffe.</HI> Dublin, 1857.</NOTE>, to harm of it. And siþ Poul techiþ in bileve, þat þei shulden not be chargious to þe Chirche, and þat þei have no power but to profite, not to harme, it semeþ bi good resoun þat þis stiward passiþ his power, and failiþ in governaunce of þe Chirche, aȝen þe reule þat Crist haþ tauȝt; and so he is not Cristis stiward, but stiward of Anticrist.

And siþ Petre hadde not þis power, ne Poul, ne ony oþir apostle, þis stiward of Anticrist mut nede come in bi þe fend. O! siþ in þe olde lawe weren preestis and

And so, siþ þe tenþe part of þe fruyt sufficide for al þes clerkes, how shulde not þis suffice now for fewer clerkis and lesse of spensis. We mai not pynche at þis lawe, þat God himsilf ordeynede first, but ȝif we putten blasphemye on God þat he ordeynede folily. And herfore Cristis apostlis, and oþere disciplis longe aftir hem, were not bisie aboute dymes, but helden hem paied on a litil, þat þe puple ȝaf hem redily. And so housing and cloþing þat Poul seiþ shulde be ynowȝ. But now men seien þat preestis ben moost gredy purchasours in erþe, and han to hem þe fourþe part þat shulde be in þer breþeren hondis; and þis þei seien is mortified, and patrimonie of Crist þat was done on þe cros.

And, for prestis han ynouȝ of suche goodis mortified, þerfore þis styward chafferiþ wiþ appropryng of chirchis; and so þe puple dwelliþ untauȝt, and unlerned in goostli helpe.

And ȝit þis blas∣pheme gabbiþ upon God, and seiþ þat al þis is Goddis werk; but in þe Olde Testament shulden siche blasfemes be stoned to deeþ. And þus bringing in of newe ordres, wiþ service þat þe pope confermeþ, techen þat he is traitour to God, and turneþ þe Chirche up so doun.</P>
<P>Lord! where he were not chargid at þe fulle, as apostlis <NOTE PLACE="marg">The more the Pope arrogates to himself, the heavier reckon∣ing he will have to render.</NOTE> weren? but ȝif he took more charge upon him bi his newe foundun ordenaunce, certis þe apostilis dursten not do þis, and ȝit þei hadden more grace of God, and traveiliden more bisili to growyng and profiting of þe Chirche. And no drede al þat þe pope haþ over, more þan hadden apostilis of Crist, he shal streitly rekene þerfore, siþ Crist is Lord of alle lordis.

Bi hem may his bodi be sleyn, and he be pursued many weies; but Crist seiþ, þat mai not lie,—Blessid be ȝe whanne men cursen ȝou, and whanne men pur∣suen ȝou, and seien al maner of yvel aȝens ȝou, for me and my lawe. As Cristis apostlis weren confortid, holde þou þe in Cristis lawe, and sue þou him in maner of lyf, and drede þou not alle þe censures þat Anticrist can blowe aȝens þee; but as he meneþ to harm þee, he doiþ þee good mangree his.

And þus it semeþ to many men, þat þes newe ordris and þer fautours failen over myche in charite, for in love of Crist and his Chirche, siþ Cristis religion were algatis beter, perfitere, sekere, and liȝtere. For Crist autour passiþ in þes; and we shulden drede Poulis sentence, þat who þat loveþ not Jesus Crist, he is cursid of God; and þis cursing is moost to drede. And generaly, worst þing is more costly and more hevy; and þus it lettiþ feble weie-goeres, to be taried wiþ sich þing. And errour in weiyng of þis love makiþ many fals weddingis; as men ben weddid wiþ þer habitis, and þer custumes, and þer singular maners, as ȝif þei weren Cristis comaundementis; and ȝit þei ben ful feble in kynde.

<HEAD>XXIV. [FIFTY HERESIES AND ERRORS OF FRIARS.]</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[Three MSS. of the present tract are known to exist,—one in the Bod∣leian, another in the Corpus volume at Cambridge, and the third at Trinity College, Dublin. It was printed by Thomas James, Bodley's librarian, in the year 1608, with as much accuracy as could be expected in that age, when scholarly criticism was all reserved for the classics. Dr. Vaughan, who has given the entire tract in his <HI REND="italic">Tracts and Treatises of Wycliffe</HI> (Lon∣don 1845), has contented himself with reprinting the text of Dr. James. The text here given is based upon Bodl. 647, with which the Corpus MS. has been collated.</P>
<P>Bale mentions this treatise in his <HI REND="italic">Catalogue</HI> of the Reformer's works, under the title 'De Fratrum Nequitiis.' Other external evidence of author∣ship there is none. The date of its composition was probably the last half of the year 1384 (see the note to ch. xxiv). So far it would be quite pos∣sible to assign it to Wyclif; but it is perhaps equally probable that it was written by one of his disciples. The language used in ch. xxii rather points to some ex-friar as the author, such e. g. as Peter Patteshull, who, having been originally an Augustinian friar, abandoned his Order, and joining the Lollards in London, 'learned that he had done well in deserting a private religion, and betaking himself to the public or general life' of Christians (Walsingham, sub anno 1387).</P>
<P>It seems probable that the form of the treatise was suggested by the pro∣ceedings of the Council of London, which extracted from the writings of Wyclif twenty-four conclusions for condemnation, ten as heretical, and fourteen as erroneous. In reply, the writer of our treatise charges the friars, the most active opponents of the Lollard movement, with holding more than twice as many 'heresies and errours' (ch. 1) as Wyclif had been charged with. The unmeaning title 'Objections of Freres,' given to this tract in Dr. Shirley's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue,</HI> and also by Lewis, has no other authority than a marginal note, in a hand of the seventeenth century, found in the Corpus MS.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<P>FIRST, freris seyn þat hor religioun, founden of synful <NOTE PLACE="marg">The religion of Christ more perfect than the so-called religion of the friars.</NOTE> men, is more perfite þen þat religion or ordir þo whiche Crist hymself made, þat is bothe God and mon.

Bot þis heresie seis þat Crist lacked witte myȝt or charite, to teche apostlis and his disciplis þo beste religion. Bot what mon may suffer þis foule heresie to be putte on Jesus Crist? Cristen men sey þat þo religion and ordir þat Crist made for his disciplis and prestes, is moste per∣fite, moste esy, and moste siker. Moste perfite for þis resoun,—for þo patroune or founder þerof is moste perfite, for he is verrey God and verrey mon, þat of moste witte and moste charite gaf þis religion to his der-worþe frendis. Also þo reule þerof is moste perfite, sith þo gospel in his fredome, wiþouten error of mon, is reule of þis religion. Also knyghtis of þis religion ben moste holy and moste perfite,—ffor Jesus Crist and his apostils ben chef knyghtis þerof; and aftir hom holy martiris and confessors. Hit is moste esy and light, for Crist hymself seys þat his ȝok is soffte, and his charge is light, siþ hit stondes al in luf and fredome of hit, and biddes noþing bot resonable þing, and profitable for þo keper þerof. Hit is moste siker, for hit is confermed of God, and not of synful men; and no mon may distrie hit, or dispense þerageyns; bot if þo pope or any mon shchal be saved, he mot be confermed þerby, and ellis he schal be dampned.</P>
<P>Bot men sey þat oþer newe ordiris and reulis ben noeȝt worth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The confirma∣tion of which by the Pope avails nothing.</NOTE> bot if þei ben confermed of þo pope, and oþir synful men; and þen þei ben not worth, bot if þei ben confermed of þo devel, in caas þo pope schal be dampned, for þen he is a devel, as þo gospel seis of Judas. And þus men seyn þat Cristis religioun in his owne clennesse and fredome is more perfite þen any synful monnis religioun, by als myche as Crist is more perfite þen is any synful mon. And if newe religiouns seyn þat þei kepen al þat Cristis religioun biddes, þei sparen þo sothe. For þei lacken þo fredome and mesure of Cristis religioun, and ben
<PB N="368" REF="391" MS="y"/>
bounden to errours of synful men, and þerby ben letted to pro∣fite to Cristen mennis soulis, and not suffred to teche frely Gods lawe, ne kepe hit in homself. Ffor by þo first and moste com∣aundement of God, þei ben holden to love God of al hor hert, of al hor lif, of al hor mynde, and of alle hor strengthes, and hor neghtbors as homself.

And so, if þis new religion of freris be more perfit þen Cristis re∣ligion, þen if freris kepen wil hor religion, þei ben more perfit þen Cristis apostils; and ellis þei ben apostataas. And if men ben apostataas, þei leeven þo better ordir, and taken anoþer lesse perfite.

Ffor þis fre goynge aboute and fre prechinge is leeveful to suche a frere, sith hit is ensaumplid and comaundid of Crist, and not to be cloosid in a cloyster, as hit were Caymes Castel <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See note on p. 348.</NOTE>.

Þo þridde is hor blasphemye of graunt of gostily helpe to hem þat wil bye or pourchasse to be Anticristis broþer.</P>
<P>As to þo first, we seyn, siker of oure feyth, þat þo whyte <NOTE PLACE="marg">I.

Ffor Crist toke bred in his hondes, blessid hit, brake hit, and bad alle his disciplis eete þerof. Ffor as he hymself seide, Þis is my body; and everiche Cristen mon is fully certeyn þat alle blasphemyes in þo world may not fals Crist. Bot here þo fals blasphemes gropen after weyes, and seyn þat bi þis þei schewe Gods body and not þat bred. Bot witte þei wil by Cristen mennis bileve, þat þes wordis of Crist ben not so naked of witte, to telle his apostils þat his body is his body, for þat knew þei first. Also, þof al Cristis shewyng were straunge to þo bred, hou shulde þese blasphemes, by virtu of þese wordes, proffe þat bred tournes to noȝt, and accident leeves wiþouten any sogett, or þat Gods body is newly þere?

And to dampne wordis or sentence of þis holy mon were a foolis tourne, to scorne of þo dampner; as we shulden scorne þes heretikes, þat leven Cristis wordis, and feynen wordis or sentence wiþouten auctorite.

Þo þridde seis, þat Cristis body is not new made, ne getis not new mater þat was in þo bred; so þat not of þis bred is makid Gods body, but þat þes accidentis bitoken Gods body. Mony soche sentencis ben feyned of freris, by whom Anticristis clerkis reversen Cristis sentence.

Þes foolis shulden undirstonde þat Baptist, when he was naked, holly ceesid not to be Jon, ne non oþer þing.

Bot feythe of þo gospel techis us to trowe þat þis is verey bred after þo sacringe, for Crist hymself seis, þis bred is my body; bot what foole con not se þat ne þen hit is bred? Also þo gospel techis Cristen men to preye aftir þis iche day bred, or owne substaunce. And Austyn techis þat by þis bred Crist undirstode þis sacrament. Also þo apostlis knewen Crist by brekyng of þis bred; and þis bred was þo sacrament, as Austyn seis, wiþ þo popis lawe.

<P>And as Anticrist marres men in hor wittis, so he destries <NOTE PLACE="marg">for it is con∣tradicted by the plainest evidence of sense,</NOTE> virtues þat shulden cum of hom.

Þei supposen sothely þat Crist was pore, for Seynt Poule seis þat Crist was made boþe pore and nedy, for þo luf of mon. And þis we graunten hom, and more þerto, þat Crist was a beggar, as þo Salme seis. Bot, for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. ixix. 29.</NOTE> to knowe fraudes and falsenesse of freris, moste we knowe what is beggyng, and maner of beggynge. No creature beggis bot mon-kynde one; ne nevere shulde have begged bot for his owne synne. And so begges a mon, þat askes purely, for Gods luf, helpe of any þing to releve him of his wreechidnes. And by dyversite of þingis þat we beggen of, and by maner of beggyng, may we knowe kyndes of beggynge.

temporal godes; and so somme beggen of men in worde, and somme beggen in dede. And of þoo þat beggen [in] worde, somme seyn treuly and expressely hor owne myscheffe, for to be releved as þei shulde be, and such beggynge is algatis of synne of þo puple. And somme cryen by worde aftir temporal godes in yvel maner, aftir more þen þei schulde have; and suche willeful beggynge lackes groundynge of resoun. Ffor of Crist I rede not þat evere he beggid in worde, ne he myȝt not begge more þen hym nedid. Sothely in þo olde lawe was beggynge forbeden <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The reference is to Deut. xv. 4; see p. 371, note <SUP>a</SUP>.</NOTE>, for hit gos oute of kynde more þen is nede; siþ bestis by kynde taken hor fode, ich one by hymself, als myche as hym nedes. And if him wante strenght, by tendernesse of ȝouthede, kynde hafs taught þo first beste to norische his owne issue. In elde þei bisye hom noȝt, siþ hor soule lastis not aftir. And so iche mon schulde, by þo wey of kynde, take þat hym nedes of temporal godes; and if hym wantid witte in kyndely power, he schulde be releved by men þat God sendes more. And so, sith beggynge is unkyndely to bestis, myche more to mon þat God lufs more, ffor God haves gyven a mon bothe powere and witte, for to begge not, bot if he be nedid by un∣kyndenesse of mon. And herfore men wischen þat yvel mot he spede þat begges on þis wyse, bot if he have nede; for slouthe of coveytouse men, þat shulden gif bifore, and helpe þo pore men, is cause of þis beggynge, or elles slouthe in covetyse of þese stronge beggers. And þus forbedes Gods lawe þat any mon be begger. And as God haves gyven men tole, to begge þus in nede, so haves he gyven men power to helpe homself as bestis; and he þat mysuses þis powere reversis Gods ordy∣naunse. And herfore techis Austyn munkes to travel; and so algatis hit is synne a mon to begge þus; for if he willefuly begge, and haves no nede, he is a schrewid begger, reproved of God. If he be nedid to begge for synne of his neghtbore, defaute is in his neghtbore, al þof he be clene; and so suche beggynge moste smake synne, ouþer in hym þat begges, or in hym þat first schulde helpe hym. Here may we se þat Crist begged not þus, siþ he had no nede, but evere was occupied in oþer better

werkes; and of Crist lerned Seynt Poule to travel wiþ his hondis, and flewȝh suche beggynge, in hym and his folowers.</P>
<P>Bot, for Seynt Petre expownes þo prophete, þat Judas pur∣sued <NOTE PLACE="marg">In what sense Christ begged.</NOTE> Crist, mon nedy and begger, hit were for to witte hou <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts i. 16.</NOTE> Crist was a begger. Ffor hit semes þat Crist beggid, not onely in his membres, bot in his owne persone, as he was pore and nedy; and so þo moste honeste beggyng ordeyned of God, and likeste to þo state of innocense, acordid to Crist; and þat he seide in dede defaute that he was inne, and asked not in worde helpe for his myschef, not by almes of mon ne pleynynge to hom. And þis seyinge in dede, wiþouten Cristis bisynes, was þo beggynge þat þo Psalme puttes to Crist. Bot as in byinge of a hors, mon byes hym not to bye þo heer of þis hors, ne none oþer lymme, so Crist bisyed hym not for þis bodily almes, bot for to worschip his Fadir, and profite to þo puple. And ne were Gods lawe, þis speche were ful straunge, ffor men speken comynly of beggynge by mowthe, not by mevynge of voyce, bot by expresse wordes; and þus menen men þat seyn þat Crist begged not.</P>
<P>And siþ freris beggen on þis wyse by autorite of Crist, hit <NOTE PLACE="marg">The begging of the friars is of a totally differ∣ent kind.</NOTE> semes þat þei conseyven þat Crist begge þus. Bot Seynt Richart of Armawhe proves on feir maner, þat were an heresye to putt upon Crist suche maner of beggynge, and mayntene hit stifly. For feyth nedes us to trowe, þat al þat Crist did, he did hit on þo beste maner wiþouten defaute; bot what nede of pro∣fite shulde mefe þis Lord, for to begge þus wiþouten any cause? Nede drof him not þerto, siþ Crist hungred nevere bot when he chees to hungre so, and ȝif ensaumple of penaunce. Bot Lord! what profit were hit Crist to begge þus, siþ he myght mefe men to gif hym when hym nedid, wiþouten any bisynes of askyng of hom? And sith þis were algatis þo better to Crist and to þo puple, what shulde mefe þo blasphemes to lye þus on Crist?

Certis, siþ Crist ches to be unchargeaunte to þo puple, ne gif non occasioun of ava∣rise to oþer, þei shulden fle þis doynge, and occupye hom bet∣ter,—specially siþ he forfended to begge in his lawe. Also, siþ freris seyn þat beggynge groundes hom, and puttes hom in hyer

degre of al þis Chirche, why wolde not Crist byfore þo comynge of freris teche þis beggynge, to profite of his spouse? Hit semes þat he shulde not bid, to lousyng of þo fende. Bot, as Seynt Hildegar seis in hir prophesye, þis beggynge abode þis peri∣louse tyme, when fals ypocritis disseyven þo puple <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">St. Hildegardis was abbess of the convent of St. Robert on the Nahe near Bingen. She lived to the age of 82, dying in the year 1180. The passage here alluded to is probably contained in the Eleventh Vision of the third book of <HI REND="italic">Scivias,</HI> the name which she gave to the book of her Visions; for this par∣ticular vision deals with the state of things existing in the Church in her own time, and to exist after her death.

Also, siþ þo gospel is ful of dedes of Crist, and sufficyent in treuthe to governe Cristis Churche, if þis beggynge of freris were taken of Cristis lif, sumwhere in þo gospel shulde hit be groundid. Bot þo gospel leves hit, þat holdes al treuthe. And so þo blas∣pheme freris, to grounde hor ordir, putten Crist out of state of innocense, and putten folie in his werkes, siþ he wrot unwarly.

Þo first and þo myghtiest resoun of freris to prove beggyng in Crist, stondes in þis; Crist askid þo womman watir to drinke, and ȝitte he was an alien, for he was a Samaritan; myche more wolde he be homely to his owne kyn. Bot here þo blynde blasphemes mosten lerne hor logik. Ffor lewid men wot wel, þat hit sues not, þof þo Lord aske of his owne þinge þat hym nedes, þen he moste begge þat þing of his servaunt. And so, if Crist bad þo wom∣mon gif hym a drinke, neverþoles he beggid not þis drinke of þo wommon. And wolde God þat soche freris beggid noȝt bot water, or elles oþer elementis, þate by kynde shulden be comyne! And, for freris may not feyne oþer drinke bot water of þo welle þat Crist shulde aske, þei feyne falsely þat Crist asked watir to drinke.

gospel telles not þat Crist askid water, ne þat he dranke water when þat hit was drawen. And so it semes þat feynyng of freris expownes þis gospel as heretikes done. Bot hit is more semely, siþ þo welle was depe, and Crist loved þo womman in shewynge of myraclis, þat he shulde make þis water by myracle springe up, and sithen drinke þerof if he had nede. And herfore olde sentence is acordyng wiþ þo gospel, þat Crist spake here of spiritual eetynge and drinkynge; for when his disciplis bad him eete, he seyde he had mete to eete þat þei knewen not. And so when þis wommon by devocioun of feyth ȝaf Crist hir hert, þen he dranke wiþ hir.

Ne if a mon aske his dette of anoþer, he begges not þis of hym, for dyversite of titel.

Bot ȝitte þo freris casten out oþer blynde resouns, þat Crist beggid a house, to eete inne his maundye, ffor, as þo gospel seis, he had none of his owne, and so he toke almes bothe of men and of wymmen; why schulde we not sey þat ne Crist was a begger? Bot here we seyn to freris, as þo Psalme seis, þat Crist was to geder bothe riche and pore, and herfore he ordeyned þo apostils to sey þat he was Lord of alle lordes; and ȝitte had he myster. And so Crist was moste pore mon þat evere was oute, and þerto most riche mon, and also moste curteyse. And so in al his povert he beggid not by voyce, bot meved folk to gif him, for more mede of hom. And so, þof Crist toke bodily almes, nevereþoles he gaf better ageyne gostily almes, and beggid nevere on þis maner þat þo freris feynen. And so he bad, as verrey Lord, to go to þo cyte, and sey to sum myghty mon by þis token, þat, Þo mayster seis, I make Paske wiþ ȝe. And at þis lordely worde of þis maister, þis burgeys of þo cyte schewed hom a grett house strewid. Lord, wheþer þis menes beggynge of Crist!

Bot ouþer Seynt Poule seide fals of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. iv. 17.</NOTE> propurtees of charite, þat hit sekes not his owne gode, but godes of comynes, or elles þese freris reversen þo rewles of charite.</P>
<P>I rede not þat Crist wiþ alle his apostlis toke more of þo <NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ gave to the people more than He received from them; the friars take all, and give nothing.</NOTE> comynnes þen he gaf ageyne. Ffor in his two feestis þat he maked by myracle, he fed þo puple in als myche as he and his apostils token of þo puple; and spiritual giftes þat Crist ȝaf þo puple was wiþouten mesure better þen hor ȝiftes. If freris, in more spense of housyng and mete, in clothyng, in juwels, chargen more þo puple þen Crist wiþ his apostils, how suen þei Crist in þis maner of lyvynge? And so hit were al one to grounde soche ordiris of beggers, and grounde Anticristis clerkis and blasphemes of Crist. Ow! siþ Seynt Richarde, bishop of Armawh, proves ageyne freris by mony feyre resouns þat þei faylen opunly fro Cristis religion; and harmen þo Chirche and þo comynes bothe; how ben oure bishops and freris now knyttid togedir, bot as Herowde and Pilate were made fals frendes? And þis knotte lastid not, for hit was yvel groundid in hate of Crist, and of his lawe; so hit semes here. And harmyng of þo puple may we sone se; siþ heven lokes lesse to fruyt of þo erthe, monnes strength is lesse, here lyve is shortere, þo tyme is lesse sesounable, and charite withdrawen. What shulde mefe Anticrist to double þo rentis of þo pore puple in suche yvel tyme? Ffor byfore þat freris comen by cautel of þo fende, þo puple gaf no more rente for so myche to hor lordes. And al þinge acountid, þei gyven nowe to þo ordiris wel nyhe als myche as þei did to hor lordes. And so frutis of worldes godes faylen in þo grounde. And siþ yvel partynge of soche godes is cause of discencioun, þo fende hafs caste þis snare for to bryge men, ffor charite is exiled, and envye is kyndelid.

Ffor þis þei suen scharplyer, and punyschen herfore; and þis privey horedame makes myche harme. As Crist biddes, undertake thryes oure broþer, and at þo fourt tyme forsake hom as hethen men. Bot þese private ordiris bidden al þo con∣trarye; for he þat sues þis gospel is holdun sclaunderer of his breþeren, destroyer of hor house, and of hor newe religioun.

Bot first may men se, hou þis maner of doynge savers heresye in proude ypocrites. For þes gostily suffrages þei sellen in a maner, siþ þei graunten not comynly, bot þere þei hope wynnynge. And more booste of þo fende herde we nevere, sith quantite of merytes is hydde fro seyntis, and chaffers wiþ soche þinges, unknowen to þo partyes, were presomptuose foly upon bothe sides. Also, sith þei supposen þat hor naked graunte is als myche worthe as graunte wiþ hor lettres, þen hor lettres serven of noght bot for to jape þo pepul. And in þis þei suen not Crist, as þei falsely feynen, for he grauntid nevere soche lettres of þing þat he gaf; and þus þei passen þo apostels, bot in ypocrisye. Also þis charite of freris schulde strecche to alle gode men; and siþ hit is als myche worthe by graunte as by letter, þen introduccioun of soche lettres serven of noght bot if it be to bleere mennis eyne wiþ threde, and wiþ gaye wrytynge. Also, siþ Cristen men wot wil þat no man aftir his deth shal have part of meryt but if he go to heven, and, as freris seyn, þei may graunt iche Cristen mon part of hor meryt aftir his deth, þen may þei graunt iche Cristen mon for to be saved; and so hom fayles charite, if any of hom∣self or elles any Cristen mon be dampned in helle. Also, men of þo gospel schulden do prively hor almes, so þat hor lift honde wiste not what hor right honde did. Bot þese freris seyn þat þis is a passynge gostily almes; þen þei schulde do hit prively, and not conferme hit opunly by hor charteres.

Also hit were inogh to freris to have breþerhed of þo puple, þat ben comynly better þen þo freris, þof þei come not unkyndely to spoyle hor breþren; ffor þei haf no skil to selle þo letters þat ne by þo same skil þei shulde begge soche lettres of oþer men, whom þei schulde suppose to be better þen þei. And if þei did þus, þei did as þei wolden þat men did to hom; and þis is þo lawe of gospel and kynde. Also, þese freris wot not wheþer þei shal be saved, or wheþer þei ben now viserde devels, as Schariot was; and if þei ben suche, þei graunten not part of hor merytes to men þat shal not be saved. And herfore hit is a fendis presumpcioun to selle þus hor merytes þat þei knowen noȝt, ffor þo gospel biddes, þat as þei take frely, so schulde þei frely gif to oþer. Ffor hit were no kyndenesse þus to venyme hor gift, as þo Pharisee venymde his dedes, for a privey boste þat he made to God. Also þei wot not wheþer hor breþren þat þei chaffere with shal evere be saved.

Þen þis schulde be supposid, sith hit semes soth, for þat God demes is evere þo better. And so schulde men sup∣pose þat soche ypocrites ben deppere in helle þen any oþer men. And if men schulde holde hor pees in þing þat [þei] <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">supplied conjecturally.</NOTE> knowen not, why boosten þese freris so boldely of privetees of God?

And so specialte in preyere is noþing worþ, bot in als myche as hit scharpes to preye for generale þinges; as, when a man preyes for a certeyne persone, his entent shulde be more principaly for þo comyne Chirche. As, when men preyen for one persone, for he is profitable helpe to holy Chirche, men preyen more principaly for þat holy Chirche.

And so, if we loved oure feyth and Cristis lawe, as we shulden luf if we wil be saved, we schulde not slepe þus in þis cause, bot warly wake. Bot negligence of Gods cause shewes þat we hate God. And cautels of blasphemes þat perverten oure fayth schulden be schaken awey by scharp dy∣vynes. For þes folis leeven þo letter of þo gospel, and seyn þat we schulde not aske what þing þat is, bot trowe þat þere is verey Gods body. Bot þo gospel telles not what þing is þere, but seis þat þis brede is Cristis owne body. For wil we witten þat in iche knotte of a stree is better þing þen Gods body, for þo holy Trinyte. And siþ we worschippen not soche sensible strees, and worschippen þis sacrament, resoun schulde dryve us þat hit is better þing þen oþer comyne bodyes.

<HEAD>XXVI. DE APOSTASIA CLERI.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[This tract is printed from a transcript made for the Delegates by Mr. French from the only known MS. in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, (C. V. 6; CC in this edition). It has been already printed, in black letter, by Dr. Todd, in his <HI REND="italic">Wycliffe's Three Treatises</HI> (Dublin, 1851). It seems to me impossible to decide whether it is really by Wyclif or not. Bale certainly mentions a 'De Apostasia' in his <HI REND="italic">Catalogue,</HI> but gives no first words; and it is more likely that he was referring to the Latin treatise of that name, which forms part of the <HI REND="italic">Summa Theologiae</HI> (Shirley's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue,</HI> p. 8) than to the present tract. The style has a general resemblance to that of Wyclif, and a remarkable expression at p. 440, about a 'lump of talow strangling the houndis,' recalls a similar expression in the Sermons (vol. i. p. 247). On the other hand, the phrase 'in mong', for 'among', is never used elsewhere by Wyclif to my knowledge; and the frequent use of the first person plural looks like some inferior member of a party rather than its leader. No indication whatever helps us to settle the date; all that can be said is, that as the subject of the Eucharist is <HI REND="italic">not</HI> referred to, there is, so far, some ground for supposing that it was written before 1381, the year in which Wyclif began publicly to impugn the received doctrine.]</P></HEADNOTE>

And ȝif apostasie is stondyng bihynde, hou myche stondiþ bihynde ilche siche þat shal be dampned? mor þan Goddis derlyng þat shal afterward be saved wisliche, al ȝif he semeþ grevousliche unkynde for þe tyme. Fferþermor we shal suppose þat bodyliche abyte, or wantyng þerof, makiþ not men religiose neyþer apostataes, al ȝif þey semen siche bi jugement of men; for oonliche charite þat sewiþ it makiþ men religiose, or of Cristis ordre. But it is knowen bi lawe of our God, þat alle þes bodiliche signes ben straunge fro charite; for charite stondiþ in soule, and not in siche signes. But Lord! wheþer weddyng wiþ siche signes helpiþ to holde religioun of Crist, and love hym of hert? siþ it is certeyn þat Cristis reli∣gioun stondiþ in love of God of al our herte. And it semeþ þat siche signes drawen fro love of Crist þo þat setten so meche trist in hem, and bynden hem to kepe perpetuelly. For þey needen a man to take heede to sensible þing, but heede to sensible þing wiþdrawiþ fro God. Also oblishyng of men un∣freeþ hem to God; but it is greet oblishyng to be bonde to per∣petual kepyng of siche maner signes, siþ it falliþ ofte þat Goddis lawe askiþ to do dedis þat Crist biddiþ, and leve siche signes; and so byndyng to siche signes lettiþ fredom of Crist. Also, siþ Crist is al witty, as our feiþ techiþ us, and he ȝaf us not siche signes, but raþer reproveþ hem, it semeþ þat þis ordre askiþ not siche signes. And herfor it semeþ þat Crist seiþ, þat kynrede of hoordom sekiþ siche signes; and þis is a cause whi signes of þe old lawe shulden ceese, bi fredom of þe comyng of Crist. Of þis it semeþ þat signes to wiche men ben oblishid ben not groundid in þe lawe of grace, but raþer techen us to leve signes.

And so, ȝif observaunce in lyves of fadris profytede to many men þat brouȝte hem to hevene, neverþelees it wer a pur open folye to make herof a rewle for al and for ever. For God haþ ordeyned somþing to profyt for oon man, and þat same þing to noye for anoþer; and ofte to þe same man somþing wer good for a tyme, and somtyme to hymsilf wold þat þing noye. And þerfor he haþ ȝiven witt and resoun wiþ his lawe to man, to chese what wer good for hym; ne it may not be þat ȝif man fayle not to God, þat þe spirit of God fayle hym, to shewe hym what he shulde do, betere þan þese <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">corrected; þ<HI REND="italic">is,</HI> CC.</NOTE> ordris can. And so men þat oblishen hem to kepe siche ordris, or ellis to founde hem evere to laste, semen to reverse God in his ordinaunce, and turne upsodoun wisdom of kynde. And herby Aristotle <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Aristot. <HI REND="italic">De partibus Animal.,</HI> lib. iv. cap. 10.

Þis philosophie assoyliþ þis folye bi þis, þat kynde haþ ordeyned to man boþe wit and hondis, bi þe whiche he may take when he wole, and leve when he wole, armur and oþer help þat is meche betere. O, wheþer Crist knewe not clerliche þe profyt þat comeþ of privat religions, siþ he left hem! It semeþ þat al siche religion smacchiþ blasfeme in shadewe of pride, for it reversiþ in a maner þe ordynaunce of Crist. And ȝif þei seyen þat many seynts han ben in þis ordre, certis many moo han ben in Cristis ordre.

And þus bi process of tyme is þe Chirche peyred, bi turnyng fro Cristis lawe, and bi love of þe worlde. And her∣for seiþ Poul, þat coveytise is roote of all yvelis þat comen to Goddis Chirche. And comynge inne of freris þat shulden quenche þis synne makiþ it mor fervent, as watir fier of smyþis.

hym, and use siche power þat neyþer Crist ne Petre semeþ to have had; siche fals power feyneþ Antecrist; and þat may be clepid Luciferis power.

As to þe first grucchyng, shal Antecrist grenne at þe day of dom, and bete togedre wiþ hise teeþ, for his sharp reprovyng of sentence of þe gospel. For þenne wo shal be to alle siche, þat clepen good yvel and yvel good. And Zebedeus sones travel∣eden in þis foly, as we alle done; and askeden bi her modir heyȝnes of þe world, þat þe oon myȝte sitte on þe oon side of Crist, and þe oþer on þe oþer syde, in his kyngdom. But Crist, willyng al good, ordeynede hem to suffre anoyes in þis world, and bi þis to come to heyȝnesse in hevene. And þus þise folis seyn, þat men þat ben aboute to brynge Cristis Chirche to þe state þat Crist ordeynede, ben aboute to distrye holy Chirche. And it semeþ þat ȝif Crist com in his owne persone, and tauȝte and comaundede þis stat to be holden, he shulde be holden a fool and fals heretik; and ȝif he travelede herto he shulde be persewid; for so doyþ Antecrist aȝen hise membris, þat over softliche seyen his sentence. And siþ al bileeve is in þe gospel, and we travelen and worchen þat þis gospel wer knowe and kept, it is openne þat we wolden destrie but heresies, for we wolden destrie errours contrarie to þe gospel.</P>
<P>As to þe secound, we seyn þat seculer lordis shulden holde <NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ magni∣fied the autho∣rity of the secular arm.</NOTE> wiþ þis sentence of þe gospel, and mayntene it wiþ myȝt. For in mong alle þe men þat evere weren her in erþe, noon heyede mor þen Crist seculer lordis; for he chees to be bore when þis lordship florishede moost in þe empyr of Rome. Crist ȝaf tribute to þe emperor; Crist wolde not so myche lessen seculer lordship, þat he wolde have a litel hous to hyde his heved inne; Crist comoundede to ȝyve þe emperor þat was hise; and to destrie lordship of prestis of þe temple, for seculer lordship shulde be holde bi hymself. And Crist norishede þe tenaunts of seculer lordis; he helede hem and fedde hem, and pilede hem not; so þat he ȝaf hem mor bi myracle of his godhede, þen he took of þe world wiþ alle hise apostlis. And for þise sixe kyndenessis, bysyde goostliche suffragies, þise seculer lordis han be to unkynde to Crist. And soone in his absence, when he was set in hevene, þe emperor reverside <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">corrected; <HI REND="italic">reverse,</HI> CC.</NOTE> him, and fordide his

ordynaunce, and makede hise bishopis haywardis <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">'Hayward' is explained by Phillips <HI REND="italic">(New World of English Words,</HI> 1662) to mean, 'a keeper of the common herd of the town, who is to look that they neither break, nor crop hedges; from the French words <HI REND="italic">Hay [haie],</HI> a hedge, and <HI REND="italic">Garde,</HI> custody.'</NOTE> of þe world, and took fro hem þe kepyng of Crists sheep. And so þe last offiss þat Crist ȝaf to Peter, and bad hym þries up his love per∣forme þis offiss, took þe emperor fro hym þat seyþ he is Petris viker, and makede hym perpetuel hayward of his drit. But, for it is to hard to kyke aȝen þe spore, wite ȝee, seculer lordis, þat þis harmeþ ȝou. For it takiþ awey help of soul fro ȝou and fro ȝour peple, and to-teriþ ȝour lordship þat ȝee tellen myche by, and evere shal mor and more, til þise unkyndenessis ben somdel amendid. And wite ȝee wel þat ȝour folye, bi whiche ȝee wenen to plese God, shal not excuse ȝou to God at þe day of dom, for Crist and hise lawe shal witnesse aȝen ȝou. And siþ Poul was not excusid bi þe olde lawe of persewyng of Crist in hise ȝonge membris, meche mor þe emperor, þat bi mannes lawe persewede þe soule of Crist in his tendre membris, shal not be excusid, siþ he drawiþ hem to helle.</P>
<P>But ferþer we shulde knowe, þat seculer lordship þat clerkis <NOTE PLACE="marg">In the true Church the order consists in all serving and loving one another.</NOTE> hanne nou smacchiþ imperfeccioun on many maner, and comeþ not to þe perfectioun of þe ordre of Crist; as seculer lorshipis asken worldliche degrees, and so heyȝnesse in worldliche goodis, but Cristis lordship askiþ goostliche degrees, and heyȝnesse in vertues, þat God oonliche ȝiveþ. And herfor, when stryf of þis was in mong þe apostlis, Crist determynede þe cause bi word and bi dede. Crist puttede a ȝong man in myddil of hem, þat was meke in many vertues, and seyde,—Whoevere mekiþ hym as þis ȝong man, he shal be holden mor to þe jugement of God. But þis world haþ put awey þe sentence of Crist; for alle prestis and seculers seken her owen goods, and þat is aȝeyn þe charite of Poul. And, for þe world knowiþ not heyȝnesse in vertues, God hymsilf shulde clepe hise servaunts as he wolde, and leve þe worldis maner of sensible þingis. And so þe rewele of religioun of Crist biddiþ, þat ilche man obeshe to oþer, not for þe world, ne for worldliche maundements, but in as myche as biddiþ Goddis wille. And ȝif a best bad a man do siche, he

(see notes at the beginning and end of the tract), and because the style, and the refer∣ence to previous labours in the same field (p. 443) both point to Wyclif as the author. There is no direct evidence of date; but as, in the passage just quoted, frequent previous statements of his doctrine on the Eucharist are spoken of by the author, it is probable that the tract was composed quite at the close of Wyclif's life, in 1383 or 1384, because, as has been said so often, he did not begin to teach that doctrine publicly till 1381.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEAD>XXIX. [ON THE TWENTY-FIVE ARTICLES.]</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[Dr, Shirley could not have observed, when he included this Lollard rejoinder to charges brought against the sect in his catalogue of Wyclif's works, that the same heads of charge, in a Latin version, are given in Knyghton under the year 1388, and that their vindication could not there∣fore have proceeded from Wyclif, who died at the end of 1384. After describing the opening of parliament in the February of 1388, the arrest of the judges which immediately followed, and the impeachment of Vere, Archbishop Neville, and the rest of the king's friends, Knyghton goes on to say that 'his diebus' the Wycliffites, 'qui et Lollardi dicti sunt,' con∣tinued to pour forth their errors with infinite clamour, heat, and pertinacity. Of these errors, he says, some are here inserted, while others which have been noted already are here repeated. Then follows a list of twenty-five points, which substantially agrees, point for point, with the list in the present treatise, the order only being slightly different. He then states that the Lords and Commons petitioned the king to take measures for the extirpation of these errors, and that the king did so, but ineffectually, 'because the hour of correction was not yet come.'</P>
<P>The treatise had been transcribed for press before I had found out all this; otherwise I should hardly have included a piece clearly not written by Wyclif in the contents of this volume. Yet the historical interest of the piece is sufficient to make me not regret its appearance, to say nothing of its own merits as a vigorous piece of writing, which are certainly con∣siderable.</P>
<P>The date of composition, if we take Knyghton's account of the circum∣stances under which the articles were 'put upon' the Wycliffites to be correct, must have been either in 1388 or 1389, for the articles were not framed till 1388, and Pope Urban, who is mentioned as the reigning pope in the first article, died in 1389.</P>
<P>The work named in Bale's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue</HI> under the title 'Super Impositis Articulis' may have been, as Dr. Shirley conjectured, this very treatise. But this remains quite doubtful; for to 'imponere,' or 'put upon' a party
<PB N="455" REF="478"/>
or an individual the maintenance of certain errors was the phrase in common use (see <HI REND="italic">Fasc. Ziz.);</HI> and it was a process continually going on until the Lollard movement was suppressed; so that the 'articuli' of Bale might have been something quite different.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[The following short piece exists nowhere but in Knyghton's <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">On the question of the genuineness of Knyghton's Fifth Book, see Appendix.</NOTE> <HI REND="italic">Chronicle,</HI> bk. v., col. 2650. His account of it is, that after having been cited by the Pope—Gregory XI—to appear before the Archbishop of Canterbury and sundry learned doctors in the church of the Black Friars, London, Wyclif appeared there on the day appointed, renounced all his errors in order to escape death, and made the confession 'I knowleche,' &amp;c. Now, Knyghton's narrative of these transactions, as will more clearly appear when we come to consider the longer declaration concerning the Eucharist (No. 2), is confused and inaccurate; and as Walden, who is in every way a more trustworthy guide, in his detailed narrative of these very transactions, says nothing about <HI REND="italic">this</HI> confession, but <HI REND="italic">does</HI> give a much longer confession in Latin, beginning 'Saepe confessus sum et adhuc confiteor' <HI REND="italic">(Fasciculi,</HI> p. 115), the first part of which agrees in its general drift with the short piece we have before us, I am forced to adopt the conclusion that the short piece before us is merely an abstract in English of the longer Latin <HI REND="italic">Confessio.</HI> It is difficult to imagine for what purpose such an abstract would have been made. It would not have proceeded from the Lollards, for their practice was to give to any documents or manifestos which they might be handling, not a more, but a less, 'uncertain sound;' instead of circulating as Wyclif's an English abstract of his <HI REND="italic">Confessio,</HI> which was absolutely inoffensive to the hierarchy, they would have been more likely, in trans∣lating it, to exaggerate the divergence from received tenets which that paper presents. I can only conceive that some zealous and orthodox priest or friar, perhaps, like Knyghton himself, an inhabitant of Leicester, might have made this abstract of the contents of the celebrated <HI REND="italic">Confessio,</HI> (for that it was celebrated, the number of answers which it called forth, and which are found in the <HI REND="italic">Fasciculi,</HI> demonstrates,) in order that, being shown about to the illiterate laity, it might convince them that Wyclif had been obliged or induced to abandon his novel views on the Eucharist. It would take too much space to quote passages from the <HI REND="italic">Confessio</HI> confirmatory of the opinon given above; nor is it necessary, as the <HI REND="italic">Fasciculi</HI> is a book
<PB N="500" REF="523" MS="y"/>
generally accessible; but I think that a careful consideration of the two documents in connection with each other would induce most critics to take the same view.</P>
<P>The <HI REND="italic">Confessio</HI> was written in the early summer of 1381 <HI REND="italic">(Fasciculi,</HI> p. 115, note 1), William Barton being then Chancellor (Wood's <HI REND="italic">History and Anti∣quities of Oxford University).</HI></P>
<P>The text given here is not taken from the printed edition of Knyghton in the <HI REND="italic">Decem Scriptores,</HI> but from the MSS. in the British Museum (Tiberius C. VII. and Claudius E. III.) from which Twysden originally printed the <HI REND="italic">Chronicle.]</HI></P></HEADNOTE>
<P>I KNOWLECHE þat þe sacrament of þe auter is verrey Goddus body in fourme of brede; but it is in anoþer maner Godus body þan it is in hevene. For in hevene it is sene fote <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The use of this singular phrase, which, so far as I know, occurs nowhere else, appears to me to show clearly the connection be∣tween this piece and the Latin <HI REND="italic">Con∣fessio,</HI> which I have tried to establish in the prefatory notice. In the latter, the terms 'septipedalis' and 'septipedalitas' occur several times, apparently in the same sense as that which we now give to the words 'extended' and 'extension,' used as philosophical terms. This usage appears to have grown out of the belief mentioned by Dr. Shirley <HI REND="italic">(Fasciculi,</HI> p. 558) that the place in the Holy Sepulchre where Christ's body was laid was seven feet long. The substitution of 'extended' for 'sene foot' or 'seven foot' would, I think, convey the precise meaning of the writer.</NOTE> in fourme and figure of flesshe and blode. But in þe sacrament Goddus body is be myracle of God in fourme of brede, and is he nouþer of seven fote, ne in mannes figure. But as a man leeves for to þenk þe kynde of an ymage, wheþer it be of oke or of asshe, and settys his þouȝt in him of whom is þe ymage, so myche more schuld a man leve to þenk on þe kynde of brede, but þenk upon Crist; for his body is þe same brede þat is þe Sacrament of þe Autere; and wiþ alle clennes, alle devo∣cion, and alle charite þat God wolde gif him, worschippe he Crist, and þan he receyves God gostly more medefully þan þe prist þat syngus the masse in lesse charite. Ffor þe bodely etyng ne profites nouth to soule, but in als mykul as þe soule is fedde with charite. Þis sentence is provyde be Crist þat may nouȝt lye. For, as þe gospel says, Crist, þat nyght þat he was betrayede of Judas Scarioth, he tok brede in hise hondes, and blesside it, brak it, and gaf it to hise disciplis to ete. Ffor he says and may not lye, Þis is my body.</P>

<HEADNOTE><P>[Besides being given by Knyghton, the profession of faith which follows is found in one independent MS., Bodl. 647, with 'Johannes Wycliff' as a heading to it. It is also included in Bale's <HI REND="italic">Catalogue.</HI></P>
<P>The account which Knyghton gives of the circumstances under which this profession was made, seems at first sight to be straightforward enough, but when pressed, turns out to be a mass of inconsistencies. After entering in his <HI REND="italic">Chronicle</HI> the short confession 'I knowleche,' &amp;c. (see prefatory notice to No. 1), Knyghton gives, without a break, a copy of the twenty-four conclusions condemned as heretical or erroneous in the Council of May 1382. Archbishop Courtney, he proceeds to say, after examining these conclusions appointed a day on which Wyclif was to appear before himself and six other bishops at Oxford, so that the business might be settled. He adds that on the day named Wyclif appeared, and gave in the state∣ment 'We beleve as Crist,' &amp;c., namely, this tract which follows; after which the archbishop considered the conclusions in Council, and con∣demned them. Now this last statement plainly refers to the proceedings of the Council of London, which took place therefore, according to Knyghton, <HI REND="italic">after</HI> Wyclif had given in the statement in question. And yet the statement itself, speaking of 'þis counseil of freres at Londoun wiþ erþe-dyn,' affords decisive evidence that it was written after the Council had sat.</P>
<P>Knyghton's narrative, therefore, cannot be relied upon to establish the sequence of events; and all that we can say as to the date of the piece is, that it must have been written between June 1382 and Wyclif's death in 1384. The difference in tone between it and the short confession 'I know∣leche,' is very marked; in that scarcely a trace of heterodoxy can be detected; in this, consubstantiation is broadly asserted.</P>

<HEAD>XXXII. [LETTER TO POPE URBAN.]</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE><P>[There can be little doubt that the original of this letter was written in Latin, in the form preserved by Walden in the <HI REND="italic">Fasciculi Zizaniorum,</HI> p. 341, and to be seen in a number of MSS. now at Vienna. The English version, as preserved in two MSS. (one at the Bodleian, the other at New College), is a heightened and amplified composition; probably it was prepared by Wyclif's followers chiefly with a view to home consumption. The differences between the two versions are indicated in the notes.</P>
<P>Of the authenticity of the letter there can be no doubt. Walden, in the <HI REND="italic">Fasciculi,</HI> introduces it with the heading, 'Copia cujusdam literae magistri Johannis Wyclyff missae Papae Urbano VI. ad excusationem de non veniendo sibi ad citationem suam, A.D. MCCCLXXXIV.' It was written there∣fore in 1384, the last year of Wyclif's life, when he was affected by paralysis, and incapable of making the long journey to which the Pope invited him.</P>
<P>The text is founded on the Bodleian (647), collated with the New College MS. (W and Q in this edition). The latter I believe to be a copy of the former, so far at least as this letter is concerned.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<HEADNOTE><P>[Although Lewis in his <HI REND="italic">Life of Wyclif,</HI> and Dr. Milman, following Lewis, have unhesitatingly assigned the following petition to Wyclif, and assumed as a fact that it was addressed to the Parliament which met at Westminster on the 6th of May, 1382, and although I am far from disputing either con∣clusion, yet it is necessary to show that the evidence on which they relied is extremely slight. For the authorship we have no other authority than that of Bale, who includes the piece in his <HI REND="italic">Catalogue.</HI> Dr. Milman writes as if the articles of this petition were mentioned by Walsingham among the opinions which he states Wyclif to have laid before this Parliament, in which case we should have had the authority of Walsingham for ascribing them to Wyclif; but this is not the case,—although, by mixing up these articles with the opinions which Walsingham <HI REND="italic">does</HI> ascribe to Wyclif, Dr. Milman <HI REND="italic">(Latin Christ.</HI> viii. 192) makes it appear so. Only one of the opinions, the sixth, named in Walsingham's schedule (Rolls edition, II. 51) bears any resemblance to any of the four articles of the petition. However, among the 'Conclusiones Johannis Wycliffe,' which William Swinderby, one of Wyclif's followers preached, according to Walsingham, at Leicester on the Palm Sunday and Good Friday of 1382, all the four articles, ex∣pressed in somewhat different language, may be found. It seems highly probable therefore that Wyclif did address such a petition to this Parlia∣ment; for, (1) he did not broach his sacramental doctrine, which is the subject of the fourth article, <HI REND="italic">before</HI> 1381; (2) it is not likely that he would have presented his petition at the short session of the Parliament which met in November, 1381, and which was completely engrossed with the recently quelled rebellion; (3) <HI REND="italic">after</HI> the Council of London (begun May 19, 1382) had sat, he would hardly have thought it worth while or prudent to urge upon Parliament the adoption of tenets which that Council had formally condemned.</P>
<P>Owing to an extraordinary blunder of the scribe who wrote the Corpus MS. (X), this petition, though twice before printed, has never yet appeared
<PB N="508" REF="531" MS="y"/>
in its genuine shape. How it occurred, it is now impossible to say; but the fact is certain, and may be verified by any one who carefully examines the MS., that the scribe has tacked on the conclusion of the tract <HI REND="italic">Of feyned contemplatif lyf,</HI> &amp;c. (Shirley, No. 26) to this petition, and transferred the genuine ending of the petition to the end of the tract. The MS. itself affords not the faintest trace of any consciousness on the part of the scribe that by this odd transposition he was making utter nonsense. The two passages where the breaks occur run as follows; I have indicated the place of each error by an obelus:—</P>
<Q><P>'Lord! where þes worldly prestis wisere þan † distried. Þe false feiþ tauȝte of Anticrist and of his false cursede disciplis is þis, þat þe sacrament þat men seen wiþ bodely eiȝe,' &amp;c.</P> <BIBL><HI REND="italic">Of feyned contemplatif lif,</HI> p. 170 of MS.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>'Þe fourþe article is þis; þat Cristis techinge and bileve of þe sacrament of his owne body . . . . . . may be tauȝt openly in chirchis to Cristen puple, and þe contrarie techinge and fals bileve, brouȝt up by cursed ypocritis and heretikis and worldly prestis, unkunnynge in Goddis lawe † ben alle þe apostlis of Crist: it semeþ þat þei ben, or ellis fooles. Also Crist wolde not take þe kyngdom,' &amp;c.</P> <BIBL><HI REND="italic">Complainte to King and Parliament,</HI> p. 297 of MS.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Dr. James, however, in his edition of the <HI REND="italic">Complainte</HI> published in 1608, 'skimmed o'er the ulcerous place' by taking liberties with the text; he makes it run thus: 'the contrarie teaching and false beleve <HI REND="italic">is</HI> brought up by cursed hypocrits . . . . . . unkunning in Gods law, <HI REND="italic">which seeme that they are apostles of Crist, but are fools.'</HI> In Dr. James, writing in 1608, this might be pardonable; but it is difficult to understand how Dr. Vaughan, though he must have felt the utter incongruity of the last part of the fourth article with the commencement, could reprint Dr. James' text without thinking it necessary to consult the original MS. The error is so plain, that I have here restored the text to what there can be no doubt was its original state, by transferring the concluding portion of the tract <HI REND="italic">Of Feyned contemplatif lyf</HI> to its pro∣per place in the fourth article of the petition.</P>
<P>The text is founded on the copy contained in the Corpus volume so often referred to. There is another MS. at Dublin (C. III. 12), but it breaks off imperfect just at the place where the erroneous transposition occurs.]</P></HEADNOTE>

<P>Þe ffirste article is þis; þat alle persones of what kynne privat <NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>Þe resoun of þis axinge is shewyd þus <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">þ<HI REND="italic">is</HI> þ<HI REND="italic">us,</HI> X.</NOTE>. Þe reule of Jesus Crist ȝoven to apostlis, and kept of hem aftir Cristis ascencioun, is most perfit to be kept for staat of lyvinge in þis world; and eche reule of what kynne privat secte, or singuler religioun maad of sinneful men, is lesse perfit þan þe reule ȝoven of Crist of his endeles wisdom, and his endeles charitee to mankinde. Þerfore it is leveful to eche man or persone of þis singuler religioun and professioun to leve it, cleve faste to þe reule of <NOTE PLACE="marg">and adhere to the rule and order of Christ,</NOTE> Jesus Crist as more perfit. Þis resoun is pleyn to eche man of wit and discrecioun, and nameli to clerkes; siþ men of þe popes lawe witnesseþ pleynly, þat a man may lawfully, ȝee, aȝenst his soverains wille, go fro þe lasse perfit religioun to þe more perfit. Whi þanne may not a man of privat religioun forsake þat, and take Cristis clene religioun, wiþouten error of any sinful fool, as most perfit? And þat Cristis reule, in his owne clennesse and fredom, is most perfit, is shewid by þis skile. Ffor in as muche as a patron or a foundour is more perfit, more myȝty, and more witty, and more holy, and in more charite, þan is annoþer patroun or foundour, in so muche is þe firste patrouns reule betere and more perfit, þan is þe secounde patrones reule. But Jesus Crist, patroun of Cristene religioun ȝoven to apostelis, passeþ wiþouten mesure, in myȝtt, witt, and good wille, or charitee, þe perfeccioun of everi patroun of eny privat secte or singuler; þerfore his reule is most perfit.</P>
<P>Also, þat Cristis clene religioun, wiþoute cloutynge of sinfulle <NOTE PLACE="marg">which are perfect, and exclude all others;</NOTE> mennis errours, is mot perfit of alle, is schewyd by þis skille.
<PB N="510" REF="533" MS="y"/>
Ffor oþere Crist myȝte ȝeve sich a reule most perfit for þis lif to be kept, and wolde not, and þanne he was envyous (as St. Aus∣tyn proveþ in oþere materes); or ellis Crist wolde ordeyne sich a reule and miȝte not, and þanne Crist was unmyȝty,—but it is heresie to afferme þat on Crist;—or ellis Crist miȝte and couþe, and wolde not <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">evidently it should be, 'miȝte and wolde, and couþe not.'</NOTE>, and þanne he was unwitty,—but þat is heresie no man shulde suffre to here. Þerfore <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">þ<HI REND="italic">at</HI> þ<HI REND="italic">erfore,</HI> X.</NOTE> Crist boþe miȝte, and coude, and wolde ordeyne sich a reule most perfit, þat owt to be kept for staat of þis lif. And so Crist of his endeles wysdome and charite ordeynede siche a reule. And so on eche side men ben needid, up peyne of heresie and blasphemye, and of dampn∣ynge in helle, to beleve and knowlech, þat here religioun of Jesus Crist [ȝoven] <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">supplied conjecturally.</NOTE> to apostilis, and kept of hem, in his owne fredom, wiþoute cloutinge of sinneful mennis errour, is most per∣fit of alle; and so to lette no man to forsake privat religioun, and kepe Cristis clene religioun, wiþoute newe wronge tradi∣ciouns of synneful men, þat ofte erreden in her owne lif and techinge.</P>
<P>Also Crist, in makynge þe reule and ordre of apostils, was in þis tyme, and hevere bifore and evere aftir, al myȝty, al witty, and al ful of good wille and charite, to make perfit reule; þer∣fore he made not oonly a perfyt reule, but most perfit of alle. But eche patroun of privat reule was unmyȝtie and lettid, boþe in ȝiftis of kynde and grace, and not al wytty, but in comparisoun of Crist an <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">corrected; <HI REND="italic">and</HI> in MS.</NOTE> ydiot or fool, and not so well willinge to make so good and perfit as Crist. Þerfore he made a reule lesse good and lesse perfit; and herof it sueþ pleynly þat Cristis clene religioun is most perfit o alle.</P>
<P>Also apostiles and here folewers, kepinge þe reule ȝoven to <NOTE PLACE="marg">and having been followed by the apostles ought to have been followed in the Church ever since;</NOTE> hem of Crist, wonne most merit and þank of God in þis kepinge bifore alle oþere tymes. Þerfore ȝif alle Cristene men, boþe in old tyme and newe, hadden kept þe same reule of Crist in his owne clennesse and fredom, [þei] <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">supplied conjecturally.</NOTE> shulde have discerved most þank of God in degre possible to hem. Þerfore no newe secte
<PB N="511" REF="534" MS="y"/>
of religioun, straunge fro Cristis secte, shulde have begunne, but þat þat was first shulde have be kept in his clennesse, of siche newe finders up of novelries and patrouns. Also hit were now as good, and of as muche merit, to kepe þe reule of Jesus Crist, as it was at þe begynnynge; siþ Cristis reule is ynowȝ, and able for alle men on lyve, of whatevere complexioun or age þei ben of. But þis reule was kept of Jesus Crist and his apostilis, and here beste seweres, by fyve hundred ȝeer aftir his ascen∣cioun, wiþouten eny finding of any siche newe plauntynge or religioun; in whiche time holi Chirch encressede and profitede most, ffor þanne almost alle men disposeden hem to martirdom at ensaumple of Crist. Þerfore it were now nott oonli meritorie or medful, butt moost medeful to þe Chirche, to lyve so, in alle þinggis and by alle þinggis.</P>
<P>Also, boþe monks and chanouns forsaken þe reules of Benet <NOTE PLACE="marg">nor is the Pope at liberty to dispense with them.</NOTE> and Austyn, and taken wiþouten eny dispensacioun þe reule of freres, as most perfit. But þe reule of apostelis is utterly and algatis most perfit. Þerfore men may forsake privat reules in religioun, maad of sinful men, and take þe clene religioun of apostelis, þat ys preched wiþ fredom of þe gospel, wiþoute dis∣pensacioun of worldly clerkes, þat in caas [are] <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">supplied conjecturally.</NOTE> queke develes, as Crist Judas Scariot <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">text corrupt; omit <HI REND="italic">Crist.</HI></NOTE>. Also, þe pope may dispence wiþ þe reule of ech privat secte or religioun, and haþ dispensed and ȝitt doþ, but he may not dispense wiþ Cristis reule ȝoven to apostlis; þerfore þe reule of Crist ordeyned to apostlis is more perfit þan any reule of privat religioun, and most perfit of alle. And herof it sueþ openly þat men may lawefully forsake privat religioun, and kepe Cristis religioun in his clennesse, siþ it is most perfit, moost esy, and liȝt for to kepe, and most siker to bringe men to hevene, and to heiest degre of blisse.</P>
<P>And ȝif oure adversaries of þis privat religioun stryve algatis, <NOTE PLACE="marg">If the friars' life be more perfect, why do they take offices which oblige them to mix with the world?</NOTE> þat here reules ben more perfit þan þe reule of aposteles, whi þanne so manie persones, as who so saiþ, wiþoute noumbre?

Siþ Crist saiþ in þe gospel, þat no man puttinge his hond to þe plouȝ, and lokynge bacward, is worþy to have þe kyngdom of God,—þat is, no man takyng perfit staat of poverte and mekenesse and pen∣aunce, is able to be saved ȝif he turne aȝen to wordly lif, pompe and pride and covetise, and ese of body, and slouþe, and riot, and gay cloþinge and costy,—þerfore þei chaungen not þe more perfit for þe lesse perfit, for þan þei were apostatas, but þei pur∣chasen þe more perfit for þe lasse perfit. Þerfore þe clene re∣ligioun and reule of presthod, by forme of þe gospel, is more perfyt þan any reule or religioun maad of sinful men. Also, noþing þat is abhominable and reproved of seyntis shulde not <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">dele <HI REND="italic">not.</HI></NOTE> be brouȝt in of oþere, by ony colour or cauteel. But þes newe sectes ben siche, þat ben of flessh, as Saint Poul saiþ in his <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. iii. 3.</NOTE> pistel. Þerfore siche sectis shulde not be brouȝt in, to charginge of þe Chirche, but alle Cristen men shulde caste awey, and holde faste þe unite, fredom, and clennesse of þe reule of Jesus Crist.</P>
<P>Paraventure þes ypocrites sayen, to exclude alle þes resouns and manie mo, þat þe reule to which þei make professioun is not straunge, ne diverse fro þe reule of apostilis þat Crist or∣deynede, but it is utterly þe same, and non oþer. But þe con∣trarie of þis excusing is opinly shewyd bi foure þe laste resouns bifore said. Ffor ȝif þes newe reules weren alle on wiþ Cristis reule ȝoven to apostilis, [he] <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">supplied conjecturally.</NOTE> shulde have taught hem [boþe] <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">dele <HI REND="italic">bo</HI>þ<HI REND="italic">e.</HI></NOTE> and ensaumpled, boþe in his lif and spekinge and writing, wiþ sermons and ritis and customes þerof; but dide not þis, neiþer in his lif, in his deþ, ne aftir his resurreccioun, ne to his ascen∣cioun. And ȝif þis excusinge were soþ, þe sectis of ffreres shulde not have begonnen aboute a þousand and tweyn hundrid ȝeer of Crist, siþ þei were bifore þe tyme, ȝe, as sone as þe reule of apostles. But þe contrarie is opin in croniclis. Hit sueþ also of þe same þat Cristis apostlis hadden boþe monkes, chanouns, and freris, ȝif men taken monkes chanouns and freris
<PB N="513" REF="536" MS="y"/>
for men þat professen sich privat sectes; but þis is opinli fals. Also, Cristis reule ȝoven to apostilis is lich and of o forme, to alle men þat maken professioun þerto, to speke of substaunce of þe reule. But reules of þes privat sectes beþ ful dyverse and contrarie, as to substaunce of þes reules; siþ summe of hem receyven dymes and dotaciouns, as don þes possessioners, but some forsaken alle siche tyþes and possessiouns, as freres mendinauntis.</P>
<P>But, to discende doun in specialte, fful mane articlis of reulis <NOTE PLACE="marg">If the rules of Orders are con∣sistent with Christ's rule, they are super∣fluous; if inconsistent, pernicious.</NOTE> of siche sectes ben openly contrarie to þe apostlis reule; siþ it is leveful to eche trewe man of Cristene religioun to converte a man of wrong feiþ to Cristene, but þis is forboden in þe reule of frere menours; siþ oonly feiþ <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">dele <HI REND="italic">fei</HI>þ.</NOTE> to ministres, and non oþere, is licence grauntid to resceyve freris to here privat sectis, notwiþ∣stondinge þat everemore freris don þe contrarie. And Crist receyvede penyes, but þei shulden not by here owene reule resceyve penyes, neiþer by hemself ne by mene persone. Also Crist, prechinge þe gospel, entrid into places boþe of wommen and men, as þe gospel of Luk telleþ. But [it] <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">supplied.</NOTE> is forboden to freris to entren into abbeyes of wommen; but freris glosen þes reules to þe contrarie; but Fraunceis here foundour comaundid hem in article of his deþ þat þei shulde not resceyve gloses upon his reule. Also, ȝif Cristis reule, ȝoven to apostelis, and þe reule of privat sectis weren al on, wiþouten resoun men leven þe ffirste and professeden þe toþer, but ȝif it were to shewe here ypocrisie. Also, ȝif þis feynynge be soþ, it semeþ þat it is as perfit and medeful to kepen Cristis reule [as þe reule] <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The scribe must have omitted these words, which are necessary to complete the sense.</NOTE> of Ffraunceis or Dominik, or eny sich oþere man. Also, ȝif þes reules ben alle on, and in noþing diverse, þanne siche a reule shulde not be clepid reule of Fraunceis ne Dominik, ne ony sich oþere, but reule of Crist; for so it shulde be of more auctorite and more comendid <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The reasoning here reminds one of the famous dilemma of the Caliph Omar, when consulted as to the pre∣servation of the Alexandrian library. 'If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless and need not be pre∣served; if they disagree, they are pernicious and ought to be des∣troyed.'—Gibbon, ch. li.</NOTE>.

And it was non nede þat Ffraunceis, Dominik, or eny sich oþer newe man bysiede him aboute makyng of þis reule of apostelis, þat freris feynen to be hern; ffor þat reule was maad of Crist, God and man, and kept of apostlis, and confermed by þe Holy Gost, and atte þe fulle declared by a þousand ȝeer and two hundrid bifore Ffraunceis, Dominik, or anye frere of such privat sect, were in to þis world.</P>

<P>Also it perteyneþ to þe kyng, þe while a bishop or an abbotis see is voyde, to have in his hond al here temporaltees, and at his owne wille to ȝeve hem to prelatis.

<HEAD>APPENDIX. ON THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE FIFTH BOOK OF KNYGHTON'S CHRONICLE <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See ante, p. 499.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>ANY matter which affects the genuineness or authenticity of the original sources of our national history is so important, that I shall be excused for examining, with such minuteness as may be necessary, the opinion expressed by Dr. Shirley, in a note at p. 524 of the <HI REND="italic">Fasciculi Zizaniorum</HI> and elsewhere, that what is commonly called the 'Fifth Book of Knyghton's Chronicle' proceeds from another and unknown hand.</P>
<P>In order that my reply to it may be intelligible, it is neces∣sary to reproduce the chief portion of Dr. Shirley's note, which is as follows:—</P>
<P>'It is of some importance to the history of this time to correct the error by which this fragment has been ascribed to Knighton, who is a dry and comparatively worthless commentator on Higden's <HI REND="italic">Polychronicon.</HI> The writer of the fifth book is a partizan of the Duke of Lancaster, and, as such, very valuable, as with the exception of some Lancastrian frag∣ments, which Walsingham unconsciously embodies, he is the only writer of that day on the less popular side. It is in these words that Knighton concludes his preface:—"Insuper opus inceptum, videlicet a conquestu regni Angliae, in V partes protelare curavi, in quarum duabus primis XVII (read XVI) capitulorum numerum praecedentis libelli, seriem et ordinem literarum de vocabuli mei expressione sumptarum observando, perorare curavi. Tertiam vero partem et quartam, propter prolixitatem sermonis et eventuum inexplicabilem concursum et finis incepti operis inex∣pectabilem visionem, absque tali capitulorum ordine transcurrendo annotare lacessitus praeoccupavi. Sicque totum laborem praesentis operis in quinque partes sive libellos distinctos protelando orditus sum." It will be seen,
<PB N="526" REF="549"/>
I think, on a careful reading of this sentence that <HI REND="italic">quinque</HI> has been sub∣stituted for <HI REND="italic">quatuor</HI> by some one who was perplexed by finding five books, but who has fortunately not seen that it was necessary to recast the whole sentence in order to make the <HI REND="italic">quinque</HI> suit. It was evidently Knighton's intention to make the fourth book contain the events of his own lifetime, as I have no doubt it does. And if we examine the Chronicle we shall see that each of the first two books contains sixteen chapters, the first letters of which form the acrostic Henricus Cnjtthon, Henricus Cnithonn, while the third book is only partially divided into chapters, the fourth not at all.'</P>
<P>It seems to me that Dr. Shirley has entirely misapprehended Knyghton's meaning, and that, owing to his not having read the sentence, nor examined the Chronicle itself, with sufficient care. He did not observe,—nor did John Selden, when he wrote for Twysden the critical introduction to the <HI REND="italic">Decem Scriptores,—</HI>that not the first two, but the first <HI REND="italic">three</HI> books of the Chronicle give in the initial letters of the chapters the acrostic of Knyghton's name. Yet this, if we read him care∣fully, Knyghton distinctly asserts. For the clause 'in quarum . . . . curavi,' may be translated as follows:—'In the first two of which [i.e. of the books treating of events <HI REND="italic">after</HI> the Con∣quest] I have taken care to complete the number of seventeen [should be "sixteen"] chapters <HI REND="italic">of the preceding book,</HI> by observ∣ing the succession and order of the letters which form my own name.' Now this is what he has actually done. The first two books after the Conquest, Books II. and III. of the entire Chronicle, do, in the number and initial letters of their chapters, conform to the 'preceding book,' Book I. of the entire Chronicle, which treats of events <HI REND="italic">before</HI> the Conquest. In the third and fourth parts after the Conquest, Books IV. and V. of the Chronicle, he has been unable, for the good and sufficient reasons which he gives, to follow the same plan in the numbering and initialling of the chapters. This is exactly what we find to be the case with Books IV. and V; the initial letters are just what they may happen to be, and the number of chapters much exceeds that in the first three books. The only oversight which I can detect in the whole passage is the statement that the work 'videlicet a conquestu Angliae' was divided 'in V partes.' It should be 'in IV partes;' for
<PB N="527" REF="550"/>
though the entire Chronicle has five parts or books, the portion 'a conquestu Angliae' has only four. With this slight altera∣tion, the whole passage becomes consistent both with itself and with the actual condition of the Chronicle; and so far from furnishing any evidence against the authenticity of the Fifth Book, bears conclusive testimony in its favour.</P>
<P>I cannot myself detect any difference of moment between the tone in which church matters are spoken of in the Fifth Book, and that which prevails in the rest of the work. Nor can I trace any difference in respect of style or language.</P>
