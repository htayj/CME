But euer as hit grewe i<HI REND="italic">n</HI> age hit grewe ful of wicked and cursed condicions, so þat no man with him myȝt dele ne accord.—Fortuned vppon a day, þat one of his felawes, that he debated with repreued and seid. Whi art þou so wicked and cursed, thou trouest that þou art þe king<HI REND="italic">es</HI> son, And þou art so, ne noȝt of his kynrede; thou were founde in þe forest as a thing forsake and cast a wey, honging by þe fete on a tre. The childe þenking gretly vppon his wordes, wox full hevy and sory in hert, and come to þe king, rehercing what his felawe had seid; beseching þe king to tel him, wheþer he were his son or no. The king told and declared to him, how þat he was founde; whereof þe childe was gretly disamayed and asstonyed, And went sode<HI REND="italic">n</HI>ly into þe temple, <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. v. 534.</NOTE> and made ful deuoute prayers and grete sac<HI REND="italic">ra</HI>fices to þe goddis, to þat entent, to haue knowlache and relaciou<HI REND="italic">n</HI> of whens that he come; whos p<HI REND="italic">ra</HI>iers was herd, and had answhere &amp; verry knowlage, þat he come of þe verry blode of Thebes, wheþer in ful grete hast and yre, he toke þe wey, And at a Castel beside called Pilotes, <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">L. v. 561.</NOTE> lay þe king, making a turney, and a grete feste wheþer þis Edyppes toke his wey in ful grete rage and oute of mesure alight a downe, and tyed his horse at þe gate bynding þe porter to open þe gate in hast; And for cause, hit was not <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="fol."/> opened at þe first worde, with his swerde he smote þe porter, And slewe him. The king stonding in a windowe, seing this case, come sodenly rennyng to þe gate, rehercyng this Edippes, whi he didde þat offense within his Castell.—Edippes holding his swerde drawen in his honde, withoute eny more, smote þe king his fader, and þere slowe him, taking his horse al sodenly, and rode fast on his wey, onespied of eny man, holding his io<HI REND="italic">ur</HI>nay toward Thebes, where, in his wey vppon a montayne as he rode, he met with an horrible beest a monstre, called a Spinx, <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">L. v. 624.</NOTE> And was so cruel a beest, that he had ny destroied þe contre aswel of man as of beest; the which beest, þere, of manhode, slowe And brought þe hede with him to Thebes.—Of which manfull dede, þe Cite and contre abought merveiled gretly, that hit might be in þe power of man to do so mervelouse a dede, And weren so glad and ioyful thereof, þat þey helden him as a conqueroure. And within short tyme there aftre, for as moche as þe king was dede, and þe londe stonding withoute hede or gou<HI REND="italic">er</HI>no<HI REND="italic">ur;</HI> the lord<HI REND="italic">es</HI> of þe londe and Cite hadden a grete counsell And by hole assent, maden a trety with þe quene Jocasta, for to take þis worthi knyȝt to husbond, And seiden with one voice, þat he was þe moste worthi able man for to gouerne þe londe, and for to be theire protecto<HI REND="italic">ur</HI> and shelde; To whom she answered and seid.

The king espying hir county∣n<HI REND="italic">au</HI>nce asked of hir, whi she was of suche chere, she atte þe last, yaf answhere in this wise, and seid, Truly ser I had a son by king Layus, that was honged by þe fete in a fforest, vnto þe tyme that he was dede, by co<HI REND="italic">m</HI>maundement and charge of his ffader þe king. Wherefor the woundes in yo<HI REND="italic">u</HI>r fete putteth me nowe in remembraunce, þe which, causeth me nowe to be þe more hevy. The king conceyving well hir wordes, And anone by verri evidence, he knewe well that hit was him self; whereof, he, al so∣denly, fell into a grete affray of him self; sytting into so greuous thought, that anone Jocasta m<HI REND="italic">er</HI>veyled what hit myȝt be, praying him for to tel hir his grete pensifnes, To whom, he anone answhered and seid. Truly, hit was my self, þat so was founde honging in þe fforest. Of which infortunat chaunce, they fil bothe into grete hevynesse and sorowe, which myschef, was anone knowe þorgh þe Cite and londe.—The king falling alwey more and more in dispaire, vnto þe tyme, that as my Auctor writeth for sorowe, he wept oute bothe his eighen, And euer of al pepłe, his sones, had him most in dispite, putting him onder fote so, þat he died in grete myschef; After whos dethe, the seid ij breþeren maden ful grete strif for þe londe and reme.—Ethiocles seying <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="fol."/> alwey, that by cause, he was þe elder broþer, he wold haue al the londe with domynaciou<HI REND="italic">n</HI> and regne as king. Pollymytes seid ayen that þough it were so, þat he were elder, yit shuld he not haue all, and he right noȝt.—The lord<HI REND="italic">es</HI> of þe londe and Cite, seyng þe grete variaunce &amp; discorde bitwen þeym, considering þe grete myschef that myȝt fall, maden grete orden<HI REND="italic">au</HI>nce, and ful diligent laboure, to put þeym in accorde and rest.

And so while þe one occupieth, þat oþer for to voyde þe londe, So þat none shuld regne vppon oþer. And for as moche as Ethiocles was þe elder he shuld regne þe first yere.

And hit was so late, and þe tempest so grete, þat he myȝt no herborgh gete, but he fonde a porche <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">L. v. 1252.</NOTE> And þerein light down and leyd beside him his spere and shelde, And so, þere, toke his rest as for þe tyme. Of Aventure bifell þe same tyme þere come riding to þe same porche, one þe worthiest on lyve, whos name was called Tydeus, And was son vnto þe king of Calydoyne, And was exiled, by cause he slogh his broþ<HI REND="italic">er</HI> <MILESTONE N="3b" UNIT="fol."/> onware of him with an Arowe at a huntyng stonding in a trist<HI REND="italic">er;</HI> And as he come to þe porche for to haue had succo<HI REND="italic">ur</HI> for þe grete wheder, Pollymet sodenly stept vp, And drewe oute his swerde, as he þat was full cursed and coragious, and asked, who was so hardy for to disloge him of his herborgh which he had take.

Pollymet with ful yrous corage graunted anone to þat tryall. Theire horse sadeled and brideled, lopen into the sadeles with speris in honde, and ron togidre with ful manly hertes, that here speres al to brekke. Drawing oute theire swerd<HI REND="italic">es</HI> and leyden togidir so strongly, þat þorgh þe noyse, þe worthi king Adrastus lying in his bed within his palis, sodenly awoke of his slepe, And called vppon hem þat were of his chambre, charging hem to wite in hast what was al þat noyse that he herd in þe strete, his s<HI REND="italic">er</HI>u<HI REND="italic">au</HI>ntes ran oute in al hast, finding thes ij knyȝt<HI REND="italic">es</HI> fighting togidre with ful grete ire, and fers corage.

Tedeus answhering first and seid, þat he was son vnto king Calydon, And shuld be his eyre, And declared vnto him þe cause of his exile, and of his metyng þere that tyme with Pollymet. Pollymet told þat he was of Thebes, son to Jocasta þe quene, but of his ffader spak he no thing. The king anone by his wordes, knewe þe grownde of his berthe, and made þeym right gode chere and ladden þeym into his palis, where he made theym ful accorded conveying, þeym to chambres, where þei were in þe best wise demened; And þe king held hem þere still with him, and hadden all þe chere and disport þat myȝt be don. Fortuned vppon a day þe king remembring him wel vppon þeire berth, and blode riall, purposed fully for to mary his ij douȝters to þeym two, which doughteres shulden be heires of his londe.—The king walking on a day in his disport, called to him þes ij knygt<HI REND="italic">es,</HI> seying to hem in þis wise Truly s<HI REND="italic">er</HI>es, I am right sory to se yow in þis disese, þenking on yo<HI REND="italic">ur</HI> noble and worthi blode, wherefor y am in ful p<HI REND="italic">ur</HI>pose if hit plese you for to gif you my ij dought<HI REND="italic">er</HI>es to wifes, þe which after my decese, shulle enherite al my reme, with al my oþer possessions and richesse.

The day of spousell sette with grete sollempnite and array full rially was done; Tedeus wedded þe elder called Deyphille, and Pollymet þe yong<HI REND="italic">er</HI> called Argyve.—Thes two knight<HI REND="italic">es</HI> by alliaunce, loued so truly togidre <MILESTONE N="4b" UNIT="fol."/> alwey during theire lyves, þat þere was neuer truer love founde bitwixt two breþeren.

But of hir I speke no more at this tyme. And whan Jason and Ercules were come to Grece, Pelleus, to al mennys sight made hem þe grettest cheere that euer man might, but in hert, hat was þe contrary.
