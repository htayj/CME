<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>EARLY ENGLISH ARTISTICAL RECEIPTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE following receipts are taken from a manuscript in the British Museum (MS. Sloane, No. 73), written in the earlier part of the fifteenth century, and are therefore about a century more modern than those we gave in our first number. Com∣pared with those, and other similar documents, they afford information on the composition and nature of the colours used by the medieval artists at different periods. The receipt for softening glass is particularly curious.</P>
