Added line numbers and folio references in MILESTONE tags. Added chapter divisions. Converted character kludges to character entities, accounting for context (e.g. @@ initially = THORN; elsewhere = thorn-thorn). Preserved linebreaks since they matched those in the print and were the basis of the reference system. Jettisoned semantic tagging (+...+ marked named entities; %..% marked expanded abbreviations). Turned tags that indicated underlined quotations into Q tags and expanded their coverage slightly to include adjacent punctuation.</ITEM></CHANGE></REVDESCR>

<HEAD>THE TEXT OF THE MIDDLE ENGLISH LENT AND PALM SUNDAY SERMONS</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MED stencil c1425 *Matris Filius Serm.Cycle (Hrl 2276).</HEAD>
<OPENER><BYLINE>Oxford Text Archive copy of the edition by Christine Thèrése Carpenter, transcribed from seven Lenten sermons in BL Harleian MS 2276.</BYLINE>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>This MEC text began life as an OTA-distributed file (OTA 0033) closely associated with the version appearing in print as C.T. Carpenter, <HI>An Edition of the Lent and Palm Sunday Sermons Contained in the Fifteenth-century Translation of the Late Twelfth-century Latin 'Filius Matris' Cycle</HI>, PhD dissertation, University of London (1984) (1:230-359) since its line breaks align with those of the print, though without apparatus, folio references, page references, introduction, Latin glosses and side notes, or commentary. Since the line-based reference system depends on arbitrary line breaks, those have been preserved with P and LB tags. Text in square brackets has been left as such; markup indicating named entities has been removed, as has that indicating the expansion of abbreviations, which are therefore now expanded silently. Folio references have been added, as have line numbers. Markup that denoted quotations underlined in the MS has been retained, and slightly expanded, rather awkwardly in the form of TEI Q tags.</P></ARGUMENT>

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1"/> <MILESTONE UNIT="folio" N="52v"/> First among alle oþer þyngs, þre þyngs ben [ful]
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="2"/> nedeful to eche man þat wole come to heuen;
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="3"/> and þese þre þyngs ben ful faire, for it ben
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="4"/> feiþ, hope, and charite. Feiþ is ful nedeful
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="5"/> to man þat he bileue in God, Fadir Almyȝti,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="6"/> and in Ihesu Crist his Sone, and also in þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="7"/> Holi Goost, þre Persones and oon God. For as þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="8"/> apostle seiþ in his Epistle, <Q>"Without bileue, it
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="9"/> is imposible [ony man] to plese God."</Q> Hope is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="10"/> also nedeful, þat [a] man fullich hope
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="11"/> euerlastyng reward. And herfor seiþ þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="12"/> profete, <Q>"Blessid be he þat hopiþ in oure Lord."</Q>
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="13"/> Charite is also nedeful, þat a man be ful with
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="14"/> loue of God and of his neiȝbore. For, as þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="15"/> apostle seiþ, <Q>"He þat louiþ his neiȝbore, haþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="16"/> fulfillid þe Lawe."</Q> And no wondur, for, as Ioon
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="17"/> seiþ in his Epistle, <Q>"He þat loueþ not his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="18"/> broþer þat he seeþ, hou mai he loue God, þat</Q>
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="19"/> he seeþ not?" And so whoso loueþ wel his broþer,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="20"/> he loueþ also his God. And <Q>"In þese two
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="21"/> commaundementis,"</Q> as Crist seiþ hymsilf ,
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="22"/> hangiþ al þe Lawe and þe profetis</Q> wordis."
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="23"/> And alle we ben halewid in þe baptym of Goddis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="24"/> Sone, þat we shulden be spiritual breþeren in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="25"/> parfit charite aftir God. Þerfor we [shuln]
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="26"/> dwelle in parfit loue of God and of oure
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="27"/> neiȝbore þat God hymsilf dwelle alwei in vs.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="28"/> For as Ioon seiþ in his Epistle, <Q>"God is charite,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="29"/> and he þat dwelliþ in charite, dwelliþ in God
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="30"/> and God in hym."</Q></P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="31"/> But sixe þyngs ben ful profitable to Cristen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="32"/> men in þese daies of her clensyng, þat is to sey,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="33"/> confessioun and penaunce, wakyngs and fastyngs,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="34"/> preiers and almisdedis. First, þat men
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="35"/> knouleche with hert and mouþ, alle her synnes
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="36"/> þat comen to her mynde þat þei han offendid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="37"/> God with in herte, in mouþ and in dede. For
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="38"/> þe profete seiþ, in þe persone of synful men,
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="39"/> "Lord, I made my synne knowen to þee,"</Q> þat is to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="40"/> sei, bi veri knoulechyng, " <Q>and myn vnriȝtwisnesse
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="41"/> I hid not,</Q> to shewe þe mekenesse of mysilf, þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="42"/> knouest alle maner pryuetees. <Q>I seide, I shal
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="43"/> knouleche aȝens myself myn vnriȝtwisnesse to my
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="44"/> Lord."</Q> And se þerfor þe profit þat folewiþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="45"/> aftir. <Q>"And þou, Lord,"</Q> seiþ þe profete, <Q>"hast
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="46"/> forȝeue þe wickidnesse of my synne."</Q> And for
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="47"/> þis gret profit seiþ Iames in his Epistle,
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="48"/> "Knouleche ȝe, eiþer to oþer, ȝoure synnes, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="49"/> praiþ for eche of ȝou togidere, þat ȝe mowe be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="50"/> saued."</Q></P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="51"/> But þer ben eiȝt principal vices þat vnneþe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="52"/> is þer ony man þat is not smyttid with hem alle
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="53"/> or with summe. Þe first is glotonye and þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="54"/> second is leccherie; þe þrid is slouþe and þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="55"/> fourþe is auarice ; þe fyueþe [is] veyn glorie
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="56"/> and þe sixte is enuye; þe seuenþe is wraþþe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="57"/> and þe eiȝt is pride, þat is queen of alle
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="58"/> euelis. Bi pride, aungel creature fel ful depe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="59"/> from heuen. Bi pride, Adam oure former fadir,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="60"/> bigilid, lost þe gret blisse of Paradijs.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="61"/> Þerfor men þat ben of feble wittis, <MILESTONE UNIT="folio" N="53r"/> þei
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="62"/> shulden wel be ransakid of spiritual lechis [and]
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="63"/> aftir offence of dyuers synnes biforeseid,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="64"/> dyuerse remedies of Goddis word shulden be put
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="65"/> to her sores. And þus God desiriþ moche oure
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="66"/> shrifte for to forȝeue vs oure synne þat we han
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="67"/> offendid hym with.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="68"/> And so sooþ it is, confessioun makiþ a man
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="69"/> gostli hool, and it be doon with a trewe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="70"/> soreuful hert. Such confessioun makiþ a man to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="71"/> plese his God bi vertuouse lyuyng aftirward.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="72"/> Suche confessioun iustifieþ a man þat he shal
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="73"/> not be countid gilti of trespassis bifore doon.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="74"/> Such confessioun getiþ a man ful forȝeuenesse.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="75"/> For al hope of forȝeuenesse stant þorouȝ such
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="76"/> veri confessioun, and þus such confessioun is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="77"/> a ful gret werk of mercy. Such confessioun is a
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="78"/> cheef medicyn to eche synful man in þis world.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="79"/> Such confessioun is, as it were, þe second boord
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="80"/> þat kepiþ vs from drenchyng of þe gret depnesse
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="81"/> of helle. For but if we verili forþenken, þat is,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="82"/> as it were, þe first boord, and aftir knouleche
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="83"/> treuli oure synnes, aftir þe abilite þat God
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="84"/> grauntiþ vs, we forsaken þe wei toward heuen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="85"/> and rennen hedlyng toward helle. And to þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="86"/> entent seiþ Salamon, <Q>"He þat hidiþ his synnes
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="87"/> shal not be dressid</Q> euenlich to heuenward, <Q>but
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="88"/> he þat knoulechiþ his synnes</Q> and leueþ hem, <Q>he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="89"/> shal haue</Q> fulli <Q>merci."</Q></P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="90"/> And þus aftir such trewe confessioun must
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="91"/> veri penaunce folewe. Of þis penaunce seiþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="92"/> Crist in þe Euangelie þus, <Q>"Do ȝe penaunce,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="93"/> for þe kyngdom of heuens comeþ ful nyȝ."</Q> Also
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="94"/> Ioon Baptist bad þe Pharisees and þe Saduceis,
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="95"/> " To do worþi fruyt of penaunce."</Q> Worþi fruyt
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="96"/> of penaunce is to inwardli wepe for trespassis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="97"/> doon, and not to turne aftir to suche synnes,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="98"/> but lyuen in vertues contrarie to suche vices.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="99"/> And herfor it is writen, <Q>"Sone, leie not synne
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="100"/> vpon synne."</Q> Also God seiþ bi Ysaie þe profete,
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="101"/> "Be ȝe wasshen and be ȝe clene."</Q> He is wasshen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="102"/> and also clene þat wepiþ for synnes þat ben doon
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="103"/> and kepiþ hym clene aftirward. But he is wasshen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="104"/> and is not clene þat wepiþ for his yuel and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> leeuyþ it not, but turneþ aȝen to suche synnes
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="106"/> þat he made sorowe for arst.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="107"/> And so veri penaunce bifore God is a man to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="108"/> make herti sorowe for his synne with trew
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="109"/> confessioun of his mouþ, with satisfaccioun of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> good contynuyng lijf þerwiþ, þouȝ man lyue not
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="111"/> many ȝeris aftir. And so ech man þat is wounden
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="112"/> in greuouse synnes, turne hym to veri penaunce bi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="113"/> tyme, and mystrist he not on Goddis merci, for
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="114"/> it is vpon alle his werkis, and in þis world
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="115"/> his merci shal not be drawen awei from ony man þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="116"/> verili repentiþ hym of his synne.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="117"/> But now boþe wakyng fro bodili sleep and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="118"/> wakyng of holi þouȝt and holi lyuyng musten
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="119"/> folewe trewe penaunce þat we haue spoken of.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="120"/> For such wakyngs shul brynge forþ fruyt of many
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="121"/> vertues þat shuln lede a man to heuenli blisse,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="122"/> wherfor it bihoueþ vs for to wake, for Ysaie þe
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="123"/> profete seiþ "Lord, my spirit wakiþ to <MILESTONE UNIT="folio" N="53v"/> þee bi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="124"/> nyȝt for þi commaundementis ben liȝt vpon erþe."</Q>
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="125"/> And herfor seiþ Daviþ þe profete, <Q>"Lord, at
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="126"/> mydnyȝt I roos to knouleche to þee."</Q> Also it is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="127"/> seid in þe persone of God in an oþer place, <Q>"I
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="128"/> loue hem þat louen me, and þei þat waken eerli
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="129"/> to me shuln fynde me."</Q> And herfor seiþ Crist
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="130"/> in þe Euangelie, <Q>"Wakiþ, for ȝe weten not whan þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="131"/> Lord shal come, at euen or at mydnyȝt [or] at
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="132"/> cockis crowyng or in [þe] morewnyng."</Q></P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="133"/> And vnderstonde þat for þre causis oure Lord
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="134"/> hidiþ his comyng fro man and also þe houre of his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> deeþ. Oon cause is þat if man knew þe houre or
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="136"/> þe dai of his deþ, man wold lede þe most part of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="137"/> his lijf in synne, and ful late turne to God. But
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="138"/> for man shuld not tarie long from his seruyce,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="139"/> he puttiþ hym in vncerteynte boþe of his comyng
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> to þe doom and of þe our of his deþ. Þe second
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="141"/> cause is for man shuld not dispeire of his helþe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="142"/> for long contynuyng in his synne. For þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="143"/> fendis temptacioun myȝt soone ouercome a
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="144"/> synful man, if he knew his endyng dai riȝt nyȝ ,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> and he so long contynued in wickid lijf. Þe þrid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="146"/> cause þat God hidiþ fro man þe dai of his deþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="147"/> and of his comyng, is for man shuld alwei
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="148"/> suppose þat þe dai of his deþ and Cristis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="149"/> comyng is ful nyȝ, and so wake in holi þouȝtis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> and make hym redi with holi werkis to be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="151"/> presentid vp to God, whaneuer he wold vouchesaaf
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="152"/> to come.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="153"/> Þerfor, freendis, I preie ȝou, biþenke ȝou
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="154"/> wel, and enquere at ȝousilf withynne, "Where ben
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="155"/> þe loueris of þis disseyuable world, where ben
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="156"/> þe stoute kyngs and wordli princes, where ben þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="157"/> myȝtti emperours and men þat wern enrichid with
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="158"/> wordli muk, where ben þe stronge ieauntes and þe

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="167"/> And aftir þese wakyngs musten folewe holi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="168"/> fastyngs. And se now what Ierom seiþ of such
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="169"/> fastyngs, "Fastyng is an holi þyng; fastyng is an
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="170"/> heuenli werk; fastyng is a ȝate of heuen;
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="171"/> fastyng is a licnes of þe world to comyng. For

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="179"/> stronge dartis aȝens entisyngs of þe deuel.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="180"/> But now vnderstonde, bi many faire
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="181"/> ensaumplis, hou profitable is such fastyng <MILESTONE UNIT="folio" N="54r"/>
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="182"/> Þe puple of þe gret citee Nyneue ascapiden þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="183"/> gret venyaunce of God, and gaten merci and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="184"/> forȝeuenesse of her synnes, for þei fastiden
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="185"/> þus þre daies togidere. Also þe puple of God
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="186"/> passid graciousli þe Reed See, drie fotid, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="187"/> saien her enemyes dreynt in þe see, aftir þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="188"/> þei had fastid bifore þei eeten þe Pask Lomb.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="189"/> Also Moises fastid in desert, and aftir God
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="190"/> vouchid saaf þat he herd grete pryuetes of his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="191"/> wisdom. Also Dauiþ fastid aftir þat he had
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="192"/> greuousli synned, and so his synne was forȝouen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="193"/> hym. And herfor Dauiþ seiþ hymsilf, <Q>"I haue
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="194"/> mekid my soule in fastyng."</Q> Also Crist fastid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="195"/> fourti daies and fourti nyȝtis, and aftir he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="196"/> ouercome þe deuel, and anoon aungels mynystrid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="197"/> hym. Also Petir fastid, and aftirward þe aungel
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="198"/> delyuered hym out of prisoun. Also Ioon
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="199"/> Euangelist fastid, and aftir God shewid hym his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="200"/> heuenli priueties. Also Poul fastid, and aftir
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="201"/> God dilyuered hym from his blyndnesse, and soone
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="202"/> aftir he took his Cristendom. What shal I sei
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="203"/> more of fastyng? As long as Adam eet not, he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="204"/> forfetid not þe blisse of Paradijs, but whan he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="205"/> had eeten of þe appul, anoon he was put out of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="206"/> Paradijs.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="207"/> Þerfor, fastyng is ful good, whan it is wel
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="208"/> temperid with discrecioun. For what good dede þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="209"/> it be, and it be do in du maner, þanne it is holsum
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="210"/> to þe soule, but what good þat it be and it lacke
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="211"/> discrecioun and du maner of doyng, it is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="212"/> viciouse and perilouse to þe soule. But fastyng
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="213"/> profitiþ litel withouten good werkis and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="214"/> almesdedis, and fastyng þat is doon with
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="215"/> almesdede and deuoute preieris is acceptable
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="216"/> to God; and it openyþ heuen to man and myȝtili
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="217"/> ascendiþ bifore Goddis troone.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="218"/> And þus holi preieris musten folewe discrete
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="219"/> fastyngs. And se now what Isidore seiþ of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="220"/> preieris. "We ben clensid," he seiþ, "with holi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="221"/> preiers, and we ben [enformyd] with deuoute
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="222"/> redyngis. " And to þis entent, seyþ Seynt Iames,
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="223"/> "Moche is worþ þe bisie preier of a riȝtwis man."</Q>
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="224"/> Also Moises bi his praier turned awei þe wraþþe

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="56"/> was</Q> castyng out a fend and it was domb, þat is to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="57"/> sey, it made dombe þe man þat it had in his power.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="58"/> But now also vouche he saaf of his merci to opene

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="61"/> As it is seid bifore: <Q>Oure Lord Ihesu was
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="62"/> castyng out a fend.</Q> Þis Euangelie haþ fyue partis.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="63"/> Þe first part shewiþ þe myraclis þat oure [Lord]
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="64"/> Ihesu dide þat men þat wolden not trowen [to] his

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="66"/> part declariþ to vs hou sotilli he answerd his

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="70"/> In þe fourþe part is shewid to vs hou openli he

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="76"/> se which ben þese fyue parties with her
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="77"/> declaraciouns arewe.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="78"/> Þe first part bigynneþ þus: <Q>Oure Lord Ihesu
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="79"/> was castyng out a deuel.</Q> And þis was euen propur
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="80"/> to hym, for he bigan it not þanne of þe newe, but
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="81"/> he had vsid it fulli bifore. For bifore multipliyng
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="82"/> of mankynde, he cast out a fend, whan he made
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="83"/> Lucifer, pryns of fendis, falle out hedlyng fro
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="84"/> heuen to helle. And now in þe latter ende of þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="85"/> world, he was boren of a maiden for to cast out þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="86"/> deuel fro man and so, bi his grace, to delyuere
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="87"/> hym fro þe fendis power. And in tokene of þese
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="88"/> two out-castyngis, he cast out a fend of þis man.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="89"/> þat þis Gospel makiþ mynde of.
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="90"/> And þis fend was domb,</Q> þat is to sei, it made
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="91"/> mankynde domb þat it worshipid not his hiȝ Maker.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="92"/> For [as] þe apostle seiþ, "Whan men hadden knowe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="93"/> God bi gret resouns, þei worshipeden hym not as
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="94"/> God, or diden hym þankyngs for her kunnyng, so
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="95"/> moche wern þei blyndid bi þe fend; but þei
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="96"/> wauereden veynlich aboute in her þouȝtis."</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="97"/> But Mathew telliþ also þat þis forseid man
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="98"/> was boþe doumb and blynd. And þus we moun se
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="99"/> here þre myraclis in Cristis worchyng: þe blynd
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="100"/> man saw; þe doumb man spak, and also was delyuered
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="101"/> of þe fend. But now take heede þat þis myracle was
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="102"/> gostli doon in þe conuersioun of heþen folk, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="103"/> in figure herof, it was bodili doon in þis forseid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="104"/> doumb man. For whan þe heþen folk forsoken þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> filþe of her mawmetrie, and token þe liȝt of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="106"/> bileue, and whan her mouþes wern opened þat wern
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="107"/> ful stille in preisyng of God, and after speken her
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="108"/> wordis to Goddis worship, þanne wern þei delyuered
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="109"/> fro þe fend. Þanne receyueden þei gostli siȝ[t]e
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> and wern delyuered from her doumbnesse.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="111"/> Also þis goostli myracle <MILESTONE UNIT="folio" N="61r"/> is fulfillid in ech
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="112"/> man þat haþ be synful and is liȝtned bi þe grace
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="113"/> of God to sore forþenkyng hym of his synne, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="114"/> aftir is delyuered bi veri knoulechyng, of his
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="115"/> synnes, of greuouse synnes aȝens God, as it were,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="116"/> of as many fendis. And for now is tyme of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="117"/> confessioun and of penaunce, studie we fast bi
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="118"/> þese two to be delyuerid fro þe fend þat haþ bounden
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="119"/> vs with manyfold synne. For if we trauele on þis

<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="122"/> But summe of hem seiden</Q> þat is to seie, þe

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="131"/> Beel, but þe Palestyne folk clepiden it Baal, and

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="135"/> it Belȝebub, þat is to sey, a man of flies or
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="136"/> hauyng flies. For many flies gaderiden aboute þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="137"/> ymage for plente of raw flessh þat was offrid

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="144"/> playned God bi þe profete, seiyng, "Þei ȝeldiden
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="145"/> me yuel for good and also hate for my loue. " For
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="146"/> Crist shewid and dide [hem] many good werkis,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="147"/> but euermore he fonde hem vnkynde and rebel. For
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="148"/> as þei hadden enuye to his vertues, so sclaundrid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="149"/> þei hym for hys myraclis; þei scorneden hym with
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="150"/> her wordis; þei blasfemeden hym for his benefetes;
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="151"/> þei grucchiden for perfeccioun of his riȝtwisnesse,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="152"/> and þat more worse was, þei shewiden hym myche

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="154"/> But now take [good] heede þat sixe maner
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="155"/> condiciouns þer ben among dyuers men in þis world.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="156"/> Oon is to ȝelde good for yuel and an oþer to not
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="157"/> ȝelde yuel for yuel. Þese two condiciouns han
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="158"/> oonlich good men, but þe first is bettir þan þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="159"/> second. Þe þrid condicioun is not to ȝelden good
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="160"/> for good, and þe fourþe is to ȝelde yuel for good.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="161"/> And þese too condiciouns han yuel men, but þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="162"/> second is worse þan þe first. Þe fyueþe condicioun
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="163"/> is to ȝelde good for good and þe sixte is to ȝelde
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="164"/> yuel for yuel. And þese two condiciouns han men
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="165"/> in þe world þat ben menelich gode or menelich
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="166"/> yuel. But þe first is [ful] nyȝ neiȝbore to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="167"/> condicioun of good men þat Crist repreueþ not in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="168"/> þe Euangelie. "But more," he seiþ, "it bihouyþ to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="169"/> do, for heþen men doon on þis maner, þat louen men
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="170"/> þat louen hem." But þe second is ful nyȝ to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="171"/> condicioun of yuel men. Neþeles, it acordid
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="172"/> with þe gode, for þe Lawe set a mesure of wreche.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="173"/> For it is writen, "Tooþ for tooþ and iȝe <MILESTONE UNIT="folio" N="61v"/> for iȝe."</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="174"/> And þus on þre maners commynli men synnen in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="175"/> condiciouns biforseid. Oon is in not ȝeldyng good
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="176"/> for good. An oþer is to ȝelde yuel for yuel.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="177"/> But þe þrid is to ȝelde yuel for good. And þis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="178"/> condicioun had þe wickid generacioun of scribes
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="179"/> and Farisees, þat contrarieden þe Hooli Gost and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="180"/> maliciousli wiþstoden Crist, þat cheeflich souȝte
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="181"/> her helþe, as is maad mynde now in þis Gospel.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="182"/> But aȝen þese þre foule synnes ben þre ful
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="183"/> good remedies. Þe first is for to do good for
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="184"/> good. Þe second is not to ȝelde yuel for yuel,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="185"/> but þe most parfit of alle is for to do good for
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="186"/> yuel. And þis Crist dide for þe Iewis, whan he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="187"/> preied for hem as he henge on þe croos, and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="188"/> specialy whan he ȝaf sufficientli his lijf for hem
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="189"/> þat so foule bla[sfe]meden hym, if þei wolden be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="190"/> conuertid. For þus he delyuerid many of þe Iewis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="191"/> from þe horrible peyne of helle þat aftir wern
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="192"/> turned to Cristen bileue.
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="193"/> But oþer bygunnen to seche of hym signes from
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="194"/> heuen,</Q> þat is to seie, þat fijr shuld come doun
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="195"/> from heuen as it dide in Helies tyme, or ellis

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="197"/> or ellis þei wolden han had manna comyng fro
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="198"/> heuen, as þouȝ þe myraclis þat Crist dide hadden
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="199"/> be noone gret wondris. <Q>But he, as he saw her
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="200"/> þouȝtis,</Q> þat is to seie, as veri God knew alle
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="201"/> þyngs open and hid, and from whom mai no þyng be
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="202"/> priue, <Q>seide to hem, "Ech rewme, dyuydid in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="203"/> itsilf, shal be desolatid."</Q></P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="204"/> Lo, þis is þe second part þat shewiþ what
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="205"/> Crist answerd, and hou wiseli he rebuykid her
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="206"/> myscalengyng. Certis, euen aftir þe lettir, þese
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="207"/> wordis of Crist ben open ynow, for as litil þyngs
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="208"/> of valew encreessen bi accord, so bi discoord ful
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="209"/> soone þei sliden awei. But what þese wordis meenen
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="210"/> goostli, Crist expowneþ hymsilf in þe next wordis:
<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="211"/> "If Sathanas,"</Q> he seiþ, <Q>"be dyuydid in hymsilf,</Q>
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="212"/> hou shal his rewme stonde?" As if Crist seide,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="213"/> "If it were as ȝe seien, þat I cast out fendis in
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="214"/> Belȝebubis power, prince of fendis, þan is þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="215"/> deuelis rewme departid aȝens itself, and so þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="216"/> power of his malice mai not stonde. And if oon
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="217"/> fend mai not put out an oþer, þanne seien ȝe faIs
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="218"/> þat I cast out fendis in [þe] power of þe prince of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="219"/> feendis. And if oon feend mai cast out an oþer,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="220"/> as ȝe seien, þanne take good heede to ȝou silf ,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="221"/> þat ȝe go out of his rewme þat is dyuyd, lest ȝe

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="223"/> Se now to Cristis hiȝ answer, þat is verili
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="224"/> vertu and wisdom of God. For chese þe Farisees
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="225"/> what part þei wolden, and ȝit wern þei fulli
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="226"/> cauȝt bi vertu of word. For contrariouse þei wern
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="227"/> to Crist, and so to þe rewme þat he was of and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="228"/> þanne wern þei of þe fendis rewme, for ech man
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="229"/> must be of þe toon or of be toþer.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="230"/> But se now what seide furþermore: <Q>"Certis
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="231"/> if I cast out feendis in Goddis fyngir,"</Q> þat is to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="232"/> seie, in þe power of þe Hooli Goost, whom Pharaos
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="233"/> dyuynours knoulchiden, and clepiden <MILESTONE UNIT="folio" N="62r"/> hym þe fyngir
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="234"/> of God, to whos vertu fendis moun not wiþstonde,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="235"/> "þanne <Q>sikerli is þe kyngdom of God comen among

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="240"/> But now among oþer, þis word "kyngdom of God"
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="241"/> haþ þre bitokenyngs. But specialy here it
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="242"/> bitokeneþ Cristis persoon, þat Ioon Baptist spak

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="249"/> Also þis word "kyngdom of God" bitokeneþ Hooli
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="250"/> Scripture, þat Crist seide shuld be taken awei

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="253"/> But now, as is seid bifore, þe fyngir of God
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="254"/> is clepid þe Hooli Goost, and þat is for delyng
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="255"/> aboute of dyuerse graciouse ȝiftis þat ben

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="260"/> Lat now se what Crist seiþ ferþer: <Q>"Whan þe

<Q> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="1"/> Whan oure Lord Ihesu had lift vp his iȝen and

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="45"/> Þe fyueþe is goodlynesse in his worchyng whan he

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="15"/> And so þer ben þre maner of weies wherynne

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="50"/> took his wei fro Bethanye, þat is to sei, fro þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="51"/> hous of obedience. For as þe apostel seiþ, "He

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="53"/> þus ech man þat wole come to Ierusalem, þat is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="54"/> to sei, to þe blisse of heuen, he must bigynne
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="55"/> at þis weie of obedience. For whoso wole forþenke
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="56"/> hym of his synne and aftirward fle yuel dedis

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="61"/> his owen flesshli wille, he is not treulich
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="62"/> obedient. But aftirward Crist cam to Bethfage,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="63"/> þat is to sei, to þe hous of a cheke, þat
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="64"/> bitokeneþ knoulechyng.</P>

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="66"/> First is set obedience, and aftirward knoulechyng.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="67"/> For man must first obedientli forsake his synne,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="68"/> and þanne he must knouleche Crist with his mouþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="69"/> to his helþe, as þe apostle seiþ. For, as

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="71"/> knoulechyng of mouþ, so without treue knoulechyng

<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="73"/> And aftir þis Crist ascendid to þe Mount of

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="81"/> God shal delyuere hym. And not oonli he shal
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="82"/> delyuere hym from yuel of wickid men, but also he
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="83"/> shal glorifie hym in þe blisful ȝeldyng of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="84"/> riȝtwis men. [Þis] is þe wey of þre daies iourney
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="85"/> þat we musten nedis passe if we woln ascape fro
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="86"/> þe fend, þat is bitokened bi Farao, and make
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="87"/> sacrifice to God with clennesse of herte, with
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="88"/> puttyng awei of foule synful þouȝtis, þat ben
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="89"/> bitokened bi þe abhomynaciouns of Egipt.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="90"/> Also þese þre vertues ben bitokened bi þe þre

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="93"/> of þese ȝatis is narow. Þe second is narower, but
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="94"/> þe þrid is narowest, for as Crist seiþ, "Þe wei
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="95"/> þat lediþ to lijf is narow and hard. " And so þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="96"/> first ȝate, þat is to sei of obedience, is ful
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="97"/> narowe, for streiȝt it is obedientli to forsake
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="98"/> oure olde synful wone, and tempre oure wille and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="99"/> werkis aftir Goddis biddyng. For such yuel
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="100"/> customs ben as bitter wedis þat drawen doun þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="101"/> swete corn. But we musten ordeyne vs hokis of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="102"/> penaunce and of hooli preiers, and so bi þe help
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="103"/> of God, we shuln litil and litil kut hem vp.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="104"/> Þe second ȝate, þat is to sei of treue
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="105"/> knoulechyng of Crist, is more streiȝt, for
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="106"/> many for shame and for leesyng of wordli
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="107"/> frenship and oþer peyne, dursten not treulich
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="108"/> knouleche þis name. But Crist seiþ þat whoso is
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="109"/> ashamed of hym and of his wordis, Mannes Sone
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="110"/> shal ashame hym, whan he comeþ in þe maieste of
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="111"/> his Fadir and of his holi aungels. And as
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="112"/> touchyng wordli frenship Crist seiþ þat whoso
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="113"/> loueþ fadir or modir, sustir of broþer, ȝhe, or
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="114"/> his owen lijf, more þan hym, he is not worþi to
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="115"/> be his. And, as touchyng oþer peyne, Crist seiþ,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="116"/> "Nyle ȝe drede hem þat sleen þe bodi, but drede
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="117"/> hym þat boþe bodi and soule mai caste into helle. "
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="118"/> And for þis k[n]oulechyng is hard, þerfor bi sich
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="119"/> knoulechyng of mouþ is helþe maad to mannes soule.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="120"/> Þe þred ȝate, þat is to seie of loue and
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="121"/> merci, is moost streiȝt, for hard it is alle þyngs
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="122"/> to forsake for Goddis loue, but harder it is a man
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="123"/> þat tristiþ in his richessis and wole not spende
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="124"/> vpon þe pore, to entre into þe kyngdom of heuen.
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="125"/> For þe ȝate of merci and of loue receyueþ pore
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="126"/> men and in mysese, and þat more is, it receyueþ
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="127"/> enemyes to loue; but bi þis ȝate passiþ not þe
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="128"/> wickid riche man nor þe auerouse nor þe wraþful
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="129"/> man. And þus it is nedeful to go vp to þe Mount
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="130"/> of Olyues, þat is to sei to þe werkis of merci,
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="131"/> and so wiþ þis goostli oyle of gladnesse to anoynte

<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="139"/> in figure herof in Helisees <MILESTONE UNIT="folio" N="70r"/> tyme, þe mete þat was
<LB/><MILESTONE UNIT="line" N="140"/> in þe pot was bittir to þe profetis sones, and
